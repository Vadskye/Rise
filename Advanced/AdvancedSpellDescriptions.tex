\spellsection{Ablate Impact}
\spellschool{Abjuration (Shielding)}
\spelllvl{Abjur 2}
\spelltime{1 immediate action}
\spellrng{Personal}
\spelltgt{You}
\spelldur{1 round}
\begin{spelleffect}
  You gain physical damage reduction 10/force. This damage reduction increases by 1 per caster level above 4th.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  This spell's damage reduction allows the subject to ignore the first 10 physical damage it takes each round. If it is hit by a attack that deals force damage, such as \spell{magic missile}, it cannot use its damage reduction for 1 round.

  You can cast this spell instantaneously, quickly enough react to an opponent attacking you (but before the attack is rolled).
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Ablative Fortress}
\spelldesc{You instantly create a simmering field of magical energy, protecting you and your allies from hostile magic.}
\spellschool{Abjuration (Negation) [Magic]}
\spelllvl{Abjur 4, Magic 4}
\spellarea{\areamed radius limit centered on you}
\spelltgts{All allies within the area}
\spellsave{Will negates (harmless)}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell functions like \spell{ablative shield}, except that it affects multiple creatures.
\end{spelleffect}

\spellsection{Ablative Shield}
\spelldesc{You instantly encase yourself a shimmering field of magical energy, protecting you from hostile magic.}
\spellschool{Abjuration (Negation) [Magic]}
\spelllvl{Abjur 1, Magic 1}
\spellcmp{V}
\spelltime{1 immediate action}
\spellrng{\rngpers}
\spelltgt{You}
\spelldur{1 round}
\begin{spelleffect}
  You gain spell damage reduction 5/force. This damage reduction increases by 1 per caster level above 2nd.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  This spell's damage reduction allows the subject to ignore the first 5 spell damage it takes each round, such as from spells and spell-like abilities. If it is hit by a attack that deals force damage, such as \spell{magic missile}, it cannot use its damage reduction for 1 round.
  
  Spells that are not subject to spell resistance are not affected by \spell{ablative shield}. You can cast this spell instantly - quickly enough to gain its benefits in an emergency. Casting the spell is an immediate action, so you can use this spell even when it's not your turn.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Acid Arrow}
\spelldesc{You fire a magical arrow of acid from your hand that speeds to its target.}
\spellschool{Conjuration (Creation) [Acid]}
\spelllvl{Sor/Wiz 2}
\spellrng{\rngmed}
\spelleff{One arrow of acid}
\spelldur{1 round per two levels}
\spellsave{None}
\spellsr{No}
\spelldmg{2d6 acid damage \add d6 per round}
\begin{spelleffect}
  You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target. The acid remains on the target after the initial impact, dealing damage each round on your turn.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  If the target becomes submerged in water or takes at least ten points of cold or fire damage, this spell's effect ends.
\end{spellnotes}


\spellsectioncomma{Acid Arrow}{Greater}
\spelldesc{You fire a magical arrow of acid from your hand that speeds to its target.}
\spellschool{Conjuration (Creation) [Acid]}
\spelllvl{Sor/Wiz 5}
\spellrng{\rngfar}
\spellsave{None/Fortitude negates}
\spelldmg{5d6 acid damage \add 2d6 per round}
\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell functions as \spell{acid arrow}, except that the target is also vulnerable for the duration of the spell if it fails a Fortitude save.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  A vulnerable creature takes a \minus2 penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, checks, DCs, and AC. If the target becomes submerged in liquid or takes at least twenty points of fire or cold damage, this spell's effect ends.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Acid Fog}
\spelldesc{A billowing mass of acidic vapors fills the area, slowing creatures down and obscuring sight.}
\spellschool{Conjuration (Creation) [Acid]}
\spelllvl{Sor/Wiz 8, Destruction 8}
\spellrng{\rngmed}
\spellarea{\areamed radius spread}
\spelleff{Fog in the area}
\spelldur{\durshort}
\spellsave{Fortitude half}
\spellsr{No}
\spelldmg{4d6 acid damage per round}
\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell functions like \spell{solid fog}, except that the spell's vapors are highly acidic, dealing damage to all creatures and objects within the area on each round at the start of your turn. The fog does not do damage in the round it is cast. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage.
\end{spelleffect}

\spellsection{Agony}
\spelldesc{You inflict debilitating pain on your foe, crippling its ability to act.}
\spellschool{Necromancy (Flesh)}
\spelllvl{Sor/Wiz 4}
\spellrng{\rngclose}
\spellsave{None}
\spellsr{Yes (Fortitude)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  The subject suffers a \minus4 penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, checks, DCs, and AC.
\end{spelleffect}

\spellsection{Aid}
\spelldesc{You fill the target with confidence, improving its resilience and stamina in combat.}
\spellschool{Enchantment (Emotion) [Mind-Affecting, Morale]}
\spelllvl{Clr 2, Pal 2}
\spellrng{\rngclose}
\spelltgt{One creature}
\spelldur{\durshort}
\spellsave{Will negates (harmless)}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  The subject gains a \plus2 bonus to attack rolls and temporary hit points equal 10 \add 1 per caster level above 4th. \bonusscalingdescription  If you take life damage, you lose all temporary hit points provided by this spell before applying the damage.
\end{spelleffect}

\spellsection{Air Walk}
\spelldesc{You imbue the subject with the ability to walk on nothing but air.}
\spellschool{Transmutation (Imbuement) [Air]}
\spelllvl{Air 4, Clr 4, Drd 4, Travel 4}
\spellrng{\rngtouch}
\spelltgt{Creature (Gargantuan or smaller) touched}
\spelldur{\durshort}
\spellsave{Fortitude negates (harmless)}
\spellsr{Yes (Fortitude)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  The subject can walk on air as if it were solid ground. The magic only affects the subject's legs, and does not grant the ability to climb vertically through the air.
  \par Should the spell end while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 damage per 10 feet of fall.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  A strong wind (21\add mph) can push the subject along or hold it back. At the end of its turn each round, the wind blows the air walker 5 feet for each 5 miles per hour of wind speed. The creature may be subject to additional penalties in exceptionally strong or turbulent winds, such as loss of control over movement or physical damage from being buffeted about.
  \par You can cast \spell{air walk} on a specially trained mount so it can be ridden through the air. You can train a mount to move with the aid of \spell{air walk} (counts as a trick; see Handle Animal skill) with one week of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Align Weapon}
\spelldesc{You enhance a weapon while bringing it closer to your ideals.}
\spellschool{Evocation/Transmutation (Augment, Channeling) [see text]}
\spelllvl{Chaos 2, Evil 2, Good 2, Law 2}
\spellrng{Touch}
\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell functions like \spell{magic weapon}, except that it also makes a weapon good, evil, lawful, or chaotic, as you choose, allowing it to overcome damage reduction of the appropriate type. When cast on a weapon that already has an alignment, this spell overrides the alignment of the weapon unless the weapon makes a Will save.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  When you make a weapon good, evil, lawful, or chaotic, \spell{align weapon} is a good, evil, lawful, or chaotic spell, respectively.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Analyze Dweomer}
\spelldesc{You discern all spells and magical properties present in a number of creatures or objects.}
\spellschool{Divination (Awareness, Knowledge) [Magic]}
\spelllvl{Div 6, Knowledge 6, Magic 6}
\spellcmp{V, S, F}
\spellrng{\rngclose}
\spelltgt{One object or creature per round}
\spelldur{\durmed (D)}
\spellsave{None or Will negates; see text}
\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
  Each round, you may examine a single creature or object that you can see as a swift action. In the case of a magic item, you learn its functions, how to activate its functions (if appropriate), and how many charges are left (if it uses charges). In the case of an object or creature with active spells cast upon it, you learn each spell, its effect, and its caster level.
  \par An attended object may attempt a Will save to resist this effect if its holder so desires. If the save succeeds, you learn nothing about the object except what you can discern by looking at it. An object that makes its save cannot be affected by any other \spell{analyze dweomer} spells for 24 hours.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  \spell{Analyze dweomer} gives only partial information when used on an artifact.
\end{spellnotes}
\spellfocus{A tiny lens of ruby or sapphire set in a small golden loop. The gemstone must be worth at least 1,500 gp.}

\spellsection{Animal Growth}
\spelldesc{You cause a number of animals grow to twice their normal size and eight times their normal weight.}
\spellschool{Transmutation (Polymorph) [Size-Affecting]}
\spelllvl{Drd 7, Nature 7}
\spellrng{\rngmed}
\spellarea{\areamed radius limit}
\spelltgts{Five animals (Gargantuan or smaller) within the area}
\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell functions like \spell{enlarge person}, except that it affects multiple animals, as noted above.
\end{spelleffect}

\spellsection{Animate Objects}
\spelldesc{You imbue inanimate objects with mobility and a semblance of life.}
\spellschool{Transmutation (Animation)}
\spelllvl{Chaos 5, Trans 5}
\spellrng{\rngmed}
\spellarea{\areamed radius limit}
\spelltgts{One Small object/level within the area; see text}
\spelldur{\durshort}
\spellsave{None}
\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
  Each animated object immediately attacks whomever or whatever you initially designate. Your control of the objects is limited to simple commands (``Attack,'' ``Defend,'' ``Stop,'' and so forth).
  \par An animated object can be of any nonmagical material. You may animate one Small or smaller object or an equivalent number of larger objects per caster level. A Medium object counts as two Small or smaller objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as sixteen, and a Colossal object as thirty-two. You can change the designated target or targets as a move action, as if directing an active spell.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  This spell cannot animate objects carried or worn by a creature.
  \par \spell{Animate objects} can be made permanent with a \spell{permanency} spell.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Animate Plants}
\spelldesc{You imbue inanimate plants with mobility and a semblance of life.}
\spellschool{Transmutation (Animation)}
\spelllvl{Drd 5, Plant 5}
\spelltgts{One Small plant/level within the area; see text}
\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell functions as \spell{animate objects}, except that you animate plants instead of inanimate objects.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  \spell{Animate plants} cannot affect plant creatures, nor does it affect nonliving vegetable material.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Antilife Shell}
\spelldesc{You create an immobile, spherical energy field that hedges out living creatures.}
\spellschool{Abjuration (Interdiction) [Barrier]}
\spelllvl{Clr 7, Drd 6, Nature 7}
\spellarea{\areasmall radius emanation, centered on your location}
\spelldur{\durlong (D)}
\spellsave{None}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  Living creatures cannot enter the spell's area. Nonliving creatures, such as constructs and undead, suffer no ill effect.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  Barrier spells may be used only defensively, not aggressively. Creatures in the area at the time that the spell is cast are unaffected by the spell.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Antimagic Field}
\spelldesc{You create a mobile, spherical energy field that suppresses magic.}
\spellschool{Abjuration (Negation) [Magic]}
\spelllvl{Clr 8, Magic 7, Sor/Wiz 7}
\spellarea{\areasmall radius emanation, centered on you}
\spelldur{\durlong (D)}
\spellsave{None}
\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
  All spells, spell-like abilities, supernatural abilities, and magic items fail to function within the area of this spell. They cannot be activated from within the field, and any existing effects brought into or cast into the area are suppressed. Time spent within an \spell{antimagic field} counts against a suppressed spell's duration.
  \par Summoned creatures of any type and incorporeal undead disappear if they enter an \spell{antimagic field}. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations, such as \spell{create water}, are not affected by an \spell{antimagic field} because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result.)
  \par Creatures within an \spell{antimagic field} cannot dismiss spells. However, you can dismiss your own antimagic field.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  A normal creature can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword. The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned.
  \par \spell{Dispel magic} does not remove the field. Two or more \spell{antimagic fields} sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as \spell{wall of force}, \spell{prismatic sphere}, and \spell{prismatic wall}, remain unaffected by \spell{antimagic field} (see the individual spell descriptions).
  \par Any part of a creature that lies outside the field is unaffected by the field.
  \par Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. 
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Aqueous Blade}
\spelldesc{You transform the active part of your ally's weapon into water, weakening its blows but allowing it penetrate your foe's defenses more easily.}
\spellschool{Transmutation (Alteration) [Water]}
\spelllvl{Drd 2, Water 2}
\spellrng{\rngclose}
\spelltgt{One weapon}
\spelldur{\durshort (D)}
\spellsave{Will negates}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  Attacks with the affected weapon are made as touch attacks. However, damage with the weapon is halved, including any bonuses to weapon damage.
\end{spelleffect}

\spellsection{Arcane Sight}
\spelldesc{Your eyes glow blue with power. All nearby magical auras become apparent to you.}
\spellschool{Divination (Awareness) [Magic]}
\spelllvl{Sor/Wiz 2}
\spellrng{\rngpers}
\spelltgt{You}
\spelldur{\durlong (D)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  You know the location and power of all magical auras that you can see within \rngmed range of you. An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning level or an item's caster level, as noted in the description of the Spellcraft skill. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 \add spell level, or 15 \add one-half caster level for a nonspell effect.)
  \par If you concentrate on a specific creature within \rngmed range of you as a standard action, you can determine whether it has any spellcasting or spell-like abilities, whether these are arcane or divine (spell-like abilities register as arcane), and the strength of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the creature currently has available for use.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  \spell{Arcane sight} can be made permanent with a \spell{permanency} spell.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsectioncomma{Arcane Sight}{Greater}
\spelldesc{Your eyes glow an intense blue as you gain the ability to discern all nearby magical auras at a glance.}
\spellschool{Divination (Awareness) [Magic]}
\spelllvl{Sor/Wiz 7}
\spelldur{\durext (D)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell functions like \spell{arcane sight}, except that you automatically know which spells or magical effects are active upon any individual or object you see, and you can concentrate on specific creatures to learn about their spellcasting abilities as a swift action. In addition, you automatically recognize any spells being cast within the area.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  \par \spell{Greater arcane sight} doesn't let you identify magic items. Unlike \spell{arcane sight}, this spell cannot be made permanent with a permanency spell.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Assimilate}
\spelldesc{Your pointing finger turns black as obsidian. You touch a creature and it dissolves into dust as you assimilate its form into your own body.}
\spellschool{Necromancy/Transmutation (Augment, Life)}
\spelllvl{Evil 9, Sor/Wiz 9}
\spellrng{\rngtouch}
\spelltgt{Living creature touched}
\spelldur{Instantaneous and one hour; see text}
\spellsave{Fortitude half}
\spellsr{Yes (Fortitude)}
\spelldmg{18d8 life damage \add d6 per four caster levels above 18th}
\par Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this spell is entirely assimilated into your form, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. An assimilated creature's equipment is unaffected.
\par If the creature has at least 1 hit point following your use of this power, you gain temporary hit points equal to half the damage you dealt for 1 hour.
\par If the creature is completely assimilated, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the damage you dealt and a \plus4 bonus to each of your attributes for 1 hour. In addition, you gain the appearance of the creature for 1 hour, granting you a \plus10 bonus on Disguise checks made to appear as that creature during that time.

If you take life damage, you lose all temporary hit points provided by this spell before applying the damage.

\spellsection{Attraction}
\spelldesc{You cause the subject to feel attracted to something.}
\spellschool{Enchantment (Emotion) [Mind-Affecting]}
\spelllvl{Ench 1}
\spellrng{\rngmed}
\spelltgt{One creature}
\spelldur{\durext}
\spellsave{Will negates}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  An affected creature feels attracted to a particular person or object. The subject will take reasonable steps to meet, get close to, attend, or find the object of its implanted attraction. For the purpose of this spell, ``reasonable'' means that, while attracted, the subject doesn't suffer from blind obsession. He will act on this attraction only when not engaged in combat. The subject won't perform obviously suicidal actions. He can still recognize danger but will not flee unless the threat is immediate. If you make the subject feel an attraction to yourself, you can't command him indiscriminately, although he will be willing to listen to you (even if he disagrees).
  \par This spell grants you a \plus4 circumstance bonus on any social interaction checks you make involving the subject (such as Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive).
\end{spelleffect}

\spellsection{Aversion}
\spelldesc{You make the subject want to avoid something.}
\spellschool{Enchantment (Emotion) [Mind-Affecting]}
\spelllvl{Ench 2}
\spellrng{\rngmed}
\spelltgt{One creature}
\spelldur{\durext}
\spellsave{Will negates}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  An affected creature feels an aversion to a particular person or object. If the object of the implanted aversion is an individual or a physical object, she will prefer not to approach within 30 feet of it. If it is a word, she will try not to utter it; if it is an action, she will not willingly attempt to perform it; and if it is an event, she will not willingly attend it. The subject will take reasonable steps to avoid the object of its aversion, but will not put herself in jeopardy by doing so.
  \par If the subject is forced into taking an action she has an aversion to, she is bewildered as long as she performs the action, making her vulnerable.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  A vulnerable creature takes a \minus2 penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, checks, DCs, and AC.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Backbiter}
\spelldesc{You subtly animate a weapon so that it strikes its wielder instead of its intended target.}
\spellschool{Transmutation (Animation)}
\spelllvl{Trans 1}
\spellrng{\rngmed}
\spelltgt{One weapon}
\spelldur{\durshort or until discharged}
\spellsave{Will negates (object)}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  The next time the affected weapon is used to make a melee attack, it twists around so that the weapon automatically strikes the wielder instead. The wielder gets no warning or knowledge of the spell's effect on his weapon, and though he makes the attack, the self-dealt damage can't be consciously reduced (though damage reduction applies) or changed to nonlethal damage.
  \par Once the weapon attacks its wielder (whether successfully or not), the spell is discharged.
\end{spelleffect}

\spellsection{Baleful Polymorph}
\spelldesc{You transmute your foe into a small, insignificant animal.}
\spellschool{Transmutation (Polymorph)}
\spelllvl{Drd 6, Trans 5}
\spellrng{Touch}
\spelltgt{Creature touched}
\spelldur{\durshort or Permanent (D); see text}
\spellsave{Fortitude negates, Will partial; see text}
\spellsr{Yes (Fortitude)}
\begin{spellhealthy}
  The subject is sickened, making it vulnerable.
\end{spellhealthy}
\begin{spellblood}
  You change the subject into a Small or smaller animal of no more than 1 HD (such as a dog, lizard, monkey, or toad). The subject takes on all the statistics and special abilities of an average member of the new form in place of its own except as follows:
  \begin{itemize*} 
    \item The target retains its own alignment, personality, and mental attributes.
    \item If the target has the shapechanger subtype, it retains that subtype. 
    \item The target retains its own hit points. 
    \item The target is treated has having its normal Hit Values for purpose of adjudicating effects based on HV, though it uses the new form's base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and all other statistics derived from Hit Values. 
    \item The target also retains the ability to understand (but not to speak) the languages it understood in its original form. It can write in the languages it understands, but only the form is capable of writing in some manner (such as drawing in the dirt with a paw). 
  \end{itemize*}
  With those exceptions, the target's normal game statistics are replaced by those of the new form. The target loses all the special abilities it has in its normal form, including its class features.

  All items worn or carried by the subject fall to the ground at its feet, even if they could be worn or carried by the new form. 

  If the new form would prove fatal to the creature (for example, if you polymorphed a landbound target into a fish, or an airborne target into a toad), the subject gets a \plus4 bonus on the save. 

  If the spell succeeds, the subject must also make a Will save. If the second save fails, the transformation is permanent. Otherwise, the creature reverts to its true form after the \durshort duration.

  If the subject remains in the new form for 24 consecutive hours, it must attempt another Will save. If this save fails, it loses its ability to understand language, as well as all other memories of its previous form, and its Hit Values, hit points, and mental attributes change to match an average creature of its new form. These abilities and statistics return to normal if the effect is later ended. The subject must repeat this save every 24 hours that it remains in its new form. 
\end{spellblood}
\begin{spellnotes}
  A vulnerable creature takes a \minus2 penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, checks, DCs, and AC.
  Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to \spell{baleful polymorph}, and a creature with the shapechanger subtype (such as a lycanthrope or a doppelganger) can revert to its natural form as a standard action (which ends the spell's effect). 
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Bane}
\spelldesc{You fill your enemies with dismay, impairing their ability to fight.}
\spellschool{Enchantment (Emotion) [Mind-Affecting, Morale]}
\spelllvl{Clr 1, Evil 1, War 1}
\spellarea{\areamed radius burst}
\spelldur{Instantaneous}
\spellsave{None}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  All enemies within the area take a \minus2 penalty to attack rolls for 5 rounds.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  \spell{Bane} counters and dispels \spell{bless}.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Banishment}
\spelldesc{You force extraplanar creatures back to their home plane.}
\spellschool{Abjuration/Conjuration (Interdiction, Translocation) [Planar]}
\spelllvl{Clr 6, Sor/Wiz 6}
\spellcmp{V, S, F}
\spellrng{\rngmed}
\spelltgts{One extraplanar creature/round}
\spelldur{Concentration}
\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell functions like \spell{dismissal}, except that you can banish one additional extraplanar creature each round that you concentrate on the spell. An individual creature can only be targeted once per casting of this spell.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  You can improve the spell's chance of success by presenting at least one object or substance that the target hates, fears, or otherwise opposes. For each such object or substance, you gain a \plus2 circumstance bonus on your caster level with the spell. For example, if this spell were cast on a demon that hated light and was vulnerable to holy water and cold iron weapons, you might use iron, holy water, and a torch in the spell. The three items would give you a \plus6 bonus on your caster level. 
  \par Certain rare items might work twice as well as a normal item for the purpose of the bonuses (each providing a \plus4 circumstance bonus to your caster level).
\end{spellnotes}
\spellfocus{Any item that is distasteful to the subject (optional, see above)}

\spellsection{Barkskin}
\spelldesc{You toughen a creature's skin, giving it the appearance of tree bark.}
\spellschool{Transmutation (Augment)}
\spelllvl{Drd 2, Nature 2}
\spellrng{\rngtouch}
\spelltgt{Living creature touched}
\spelldur{\durshort}
\spellsave{Fortitude negates (harmless)}
\spellsr{Yes (Fortitude)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  The subject gains a \plus2 bonus to its natural armor modifier. \bonusscalingdescription In addition, the subject gains physical damage reduction 2/adamantine or fire. This damage reduction increases by 1 for every four levels above 4th.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  This spell's damage reduction allows the subject to ignore the first 2 physical damage it takes each round. If it is hit by a adamantine weapon or an attack that deals fire damage, it cannot use its damage reduction for 1 round.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Bestow Curse}
\spelldesc{You place a curse on your foe, crippling its ability to act.}
\spellschool{Necromancy (Life) [Curse]}
\spelllvl{Clr 5, Death 5, Evil 5, Necro 5}
\spellrng{\rngclose}
\spelltgt{One creature}
\spelldur{Permanent}
\spellsave{Will negates}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  The subject suffers one of the following three effects, chosen by you:
  \begin{itemize*}
    \item \minus6 penalty to an attribute.
    \item \minus4 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, checks, DCs, and AC.
    \item Each turn, the target has a 25\% chance to take no action; otherwise, it acts normally.
  \end{itemize*}
  \par You may also invent your own curse, but it should be no more powerful than those described above.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  Curses cannot be dispelled. \spell{Bestow curse} counters \spell{remove curse}.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Black Tentacles}
\spelldesc{You conjure a field of rubbery black tentacles, each 5 feet long. These waving members seem to spring forth from the earth, floor, or whatever surface is underfoot -- including water.

\begin{spelleffect}
  At the start of your turn, every creature within the area of the spell is the target of a grapple attack. This attack is also made in the round that \spell{black tentacles} is cast. Treat the tentacles attacking a particular target as a Medium creature with a base attack bonus equal to your caster level and a Strength score of 8. Thus, its grapple attack modifier is equal to your caster level \plus8. Roll only once each round for the entire spell effect, and apply the result to all creatures within the area of effect.
  \par If the tentacles succeed in grappling a foe, that foe takes 1d8\plus4 damage. Each round that black tentacles succeeds on a grapple attack, it deals an additional 1d8\plus4 damage. The tentacles continue to crush the opponent until the spell ends or the opponent escapes.
  \par The tentacles are immune to all types of damage. The entire area of effect is considered difficult terrain while the tentacles last, and any creature that enters the area of the spell is immediately attacked by the tentacles.

  Any creature passing through the wall takes damage, with a Reflex save for half.

  You ``blink" back and forth between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. This has several effects, as follows.
  \begin{itemize*}
    \item All attacks made against you and spells targeted on you have a 50\% chance to fail. This failure chance is reduced to 20\% if the attack can strike ethereal targets or if the attacker can see ethereal targets. If both are true, the attack suffers no chance of failure. Force effects can strike ethereal targets.
    \item You take half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane).
    \item You take half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.
    \item All of your attacks and spells have a 20\% chance to happen while you are in the Ethereal Plane, which usually means they have no effect.
    \item You can move at only three-quarters speed (because movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed, and you spend about half your time there and half your time material.)
    \item You can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50\% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 damage per 5 feet so traveled.

However, it is by no means a true treant; it cannot converse with actual treants or control trees. If the staff-treant is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it crumbles to powder and the staff is destroyed. Otherwise, the staff returns to its normal form when the spell duration expires (or when the spell is dismissed), and it can be used as the focus for another casting of the spell. The staff-treant is always at full strength when created, despite any wounds it may have incurred the last time it appeared.

  This charm makes a humanoid creature regard you as its trusted friend and ally. If it is currently faced with any obvious threat from you or your allies, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the creature, it receives a \plus5 circumstance bonus on its saving throw.
  \par The spell does not enable you to control the subject as if it were an automaton, but it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must succeed at a Diplomacy check to convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) Treat the target as a friend (a \plus10 relationship modifier) for the purpose of the Diplomacy check. An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing.

Since this hand is directed by you, its ability to notice or attack invisible or concealed creatures is no better than yours.
  \par The hand attacks once per round, and its attack bonus equals your caster level \add your casting attribute, which is the hand's Strength score, \minus1 for being Large.

  \par First, each shielded creature gains a \plus5 bonus to its saving throws.
  \par Second, each shielded creature gains spell resistance against lawful spells and spells cast by lawful creatures.
  \par Third, the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence, just as \spell{protection from law} does.

\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell functions like \spell{fog cloud}, except that living creatures inside the fog take 1d4 Constitution damage on your turn each round. A successful Fortitude save negates the damage for that round.
  \par Unlike a \spell{fog cloud}, the \spell{cloudkill} moves away from you at 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground. Figure out the cloud's new spread each round based on its new point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from the point of origin where you cast the spell.
\end{spelleffect}

  Holding one's breath doesn't help against the poison, but creatures immune to poison are unaffected.

  A dazzled creature has a 20\% miss chance on all attack rolls and takes a \minus4 penalty to Spot checks. He is also unable to see with darkvision. A bewildered creature is mentally affected in a way that detracts from its ability to act, causing it to be vulnerable. It takes a \minus2 penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, checks, DCs, and AC.

  Creatures who cannot see the light are not affected by this spell. Merely closing one's eyes is insufficient protection.

  Depending on the version you choose, the \spell{control water} spell raises or lowers water.
  \par \subspell{Lower Water} This causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by as much as 2 feet per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch). The water is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides are up to caster level \mtimes 10 feet long. In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell.
  \par \subspell{Raise Water} This causes water or similar liquid to rise in height, just as the lower water version causes it to lower. Boats raised in this way slide down the sides of the hump that the spell creates. If the area affected by the spell includes riverbanks, a beach, or other land nearby, the water can spill over onto dry land.

  \par The volume of sound created depends on your level. You can produce as much noise as two normal humans per caster level. Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The noise a \spell{ghost sound} spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit, including speech.

  Normal lights (torches, candles, lanterns, and so forth) are incapable of brightening the area or shining through it, as are light spells of lower level.

  You know the direction to any evil creatures or objects in the area by seeing their auras. If you concentrate on a particular aura, you learn how powerful it is, as determined by the table below.
  \par If the HV or level of the aura's source is at least twice your caster level, the power of the aura increases by one step, with strong auras becoming overwhelming. If you are good, and you concentrate on a creature with an overwhelming aura, you must make a Will save or be stunned for 1 round (which typically breaks your concentration, ending the spell).

    \par 1 Use the item or spell's caster level to determine whether the power of the aura us unusually strong.
    \par 2 Some characters who are not clerics (such as blackguards) may radiate an aura of equivalent power. The class description will indicate whether this applies.
  \end{dtable}
  \par \subspell{Lingering Aura} An evil aura can linger after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a creature or magic item). If \spell{detect evil} is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). Most auras only linger for a few rounds, but strong or overwhelming auras can linger for days.

If the highest Intelligence is 20 or higher and at least 10 points higher than your own Intelligence score, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends. This spell does not let you determine the location of the thinking minds if you can't see the creatures whose thoughts you are detecting.
  \par \subspell{3rd Round} Surface thoughts of any mind in the area. A target's Will save prevents you from reading its thoughts, and you must cast detect thoughts again to have another chance. Creatures of animal intelligence (Int 1 or 2) have simple, instinctual thoughts that you can pick up. You need not be able to see a creature to detect thoughts from it.

\begin{spelleffect}
  You can use \spell{dispel magic} to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.
  \par Note: The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect. 
  \par You choose to use dispel magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell.

  \par \subspell{Targeted Dispel} One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make a single dispel check (1d20 \add your caster level) which applies against all spells or effects currently active on the target. The DC for this dispel check is 11 \add the caster level of the effect. Your check is compared against each effect's DC. If you succeed on the check, each effect with that DC is dispelled.

  \par If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning) and you succeed on your dispel check, you end the spell that conjured the object or creature.
  \par If the object that you target is a magic item, you compare your dispel check against the item's caster level. If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 5 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.
  \par You may choose to automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.
  \par \subspell{Area Dispel} When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a \areamed radius.

  \par This functions as a targeted dispel against every creature, object, and ongoing spell in the area, except that you can only dispel one effect from each target in the area. The effect dispelled is the one with the highest spell level that your dispel check would succeed against. If multiple spells qualify, choose randomly. Attended magic items are unaffected by an area dispel.

  \par \subspell{Counterspell} When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.

\begin{spelleffect}
  You can control the actions of any humanoid creature through a telepathic link that you establish with the subject's mind.
  \par If you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as ``Come here," ``Go there," ``Fight," and ``Stand still." If you concentrate on the spell, you know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically.
  \par Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth). Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill description).
  It takes time for the link to be established. For the first hour after the spell is cast, you must concentrate on the spell (a standard action) to control the subject's actions. While you are not concentrating on the spell, the creature acts as if confused, as the \spell{confusion} spell, except that it never attacks you. If the subject would randomly attack you, it instead is forced to follow your commands. At the end of the hour, the creature makes a second saving throw against the spell effect. If you concentrate on the spell during this time, it takes a \minus4 penalty on the saving throw. If it succeeds, it ignores the spell effect; otherwise, you dominate it fully for the remainder of the spell duration.
  \par After the first hour, changing your instructions or giving a dominated creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.
  \par By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can't communicate with you. You can't actually see through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on.
  \par Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw. This does not apply when a subject is merely ordered to perform an action it disagrees with -- the action must be directly opposed to the subject's beliefs. Ordering a paladin to murder an innocent would grant the paladin a saving throw, but ordering him to build a bridge that would allow an evil army to cross a river would not grant him a saving throw. Obviously self-destructive orders are never carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control it.
  \par If you recast this spell on a subject you have dominated before it escapes your control, you can extend the duration of the spell indefinitely. The subject does not get a new saving throw when you renew your control in this fashion.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  \spell{Protection from evil} or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so shielded, but such an effect neither prevents the establishment of domination nor dispels it.

  The subject gains the earth glide ability, as an earth elemental. This allows it to glide through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal  as if it were air. The subject can walk, run, or climb at any angle in the earth. However, the subject generally cannot breathe, speak, or hear while gliding. While gliding, a creature can remain partially within the earth, granting it cover.

\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
  An intense but highly localized tremor rips the ground. The shock knocks creatures down, collapses structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more. The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground can't move or attack. A spellcaster on the ground who attempts to cast a spell must make a Concentration check against a DC equal to (this spell's save DC \add double the level of the spell being cast) or lose the spell. The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area. The specific effect of an earthquake spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.
  \par \subspell{Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel} The spell collapses the roof, dealing 7d8 bludgeoning damage \add d8 per four caster levels above 14th to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex half) and pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below). An earthquake cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris.
  \par \subspell{Cliffs} Earthquake causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it fell vertically. Any creature in the path takes 7d6 bludgeoning damage \add d6 per four caster levels above 14th (Reflex half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).
  \par \subspell{Open Ground} Each creature standing in the area must make a Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25\% chance to fall into one (Reflex save to avoid, whether the creature fell down or not). At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut, dealing 7d10 bludgeoning damage \add d10 per four caster levels above 14th to any creatures trapped in them and ejecting their bodies (dead or alive).
  \par \subspell{Structure} Any structure standing on open ground takes 10 damage per caster level, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 7d6 bludgeoning damage \add d6 per four caster levels above 14th (Reflex half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).
  \par \subspell{River, Lake, or Marsh} Fissures open underneath the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must make a Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.

\spellsave{None}
\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell opens a portal to an Elemental Plane and summons elementals from it. A druid can choose the plane (Air, Earth, Fire, or Water); a cleric opens a portal to the plane matching his domain.
  \par When the spell is complete, 2d4 Large elementals appear. Five minutes later, 1d4 Huge elementals appear. Five minutes after that, one greater elemental appears. Each elemental has maximum hit points per HV. Once these creatures appear, they serve you for the duration of the spell.
  \par The elementals obey you explicitly and never attack you, even if someone else manages to gain control over them. You do not need to concentrate to maintain control over the elementals. You can dismiss them singly or in groups at any time.
  \par When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, earth, fire, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.

\spelldur{\durlong or until discharged}
\spellsave{None}
\spellsr{Yes (Fortitude)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell functions like \spell{greater resist energy}, except that you store up the energy you absorb and can later discharge it as a ray. To discharge a ray requires a standard action. You can choose to fire any number of rays during the spell's duration. The ray you fire must be of one of the energy types you have stored (if you have stored more than one type, you can choose what kind of energy to use for each ray). If a ray successfully strikes its target (requiring a ranged touch attack), the target takes damage equal to the amount of energy damage of that type you have stored, up to a maximum of three times your caster level. As long as this power remains in effect, you can continue to absorb energy damage and fire additional rays using the stored damage.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  This spell's descriptor is the same as the type of energy you discharge in a ray; thus, its subtype can change during the course of the spell's duration.

  \par An undead creature struck by the ray instead gains temporary hit points equal to 40 \add twice your caster level and physical damage reduction 16/positive. 
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  The damage reduction allows an undead subject to ignore the first 16 physical damage it takes each round. If it is hit by an attack that deals positive damage, such as \spell{cure light wounds}, it cannot use its damage reduction for 1 round.

\begin{spelleffect}
  The target gains three negative levels.
  \par Each negative level gives a creature a \minus1 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, checks, and effective level (for determining the power, DC, and other details of spells or special abilities). Additionally, a spellcaster loses one spell or spell slot from his or her highest available level. If the subject has at least as many negative levels as HV, it dies.
  \par An undead creature struck by the ray gains physical damage reduction 8/positive instead. This damage reduction increases by 1 per two caster levels above 8th.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  This spell stacks with any effect that bestows negative levels, including itself.

  The damage reduction allows an undead subject to ignore the first 8 physical damage it takes each round. If it is hit by an attack that deals positive damage, such as \spell{cure light wounds}, it cannot use its damage reduction for 1 round.

\spellsr{Yes (Fortitude)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell causes instant growth of a humanoid creature, doubling its height and multiplying its weight by 8. This increase changes the creature's size category to the next larger one. This has several effects.
  \begin{itemize*} 
    \item \plus10 ft. inherent bonus to movement speed.
    \item \minus1 penalty to attack rolls and AC due to its increased size.
  \item \minus2 penalty to Dexterity.
  \item \plus2 bonus to Strength. \bonusscalingdescription
  \end{itemize*}
  \par A humanoid creature whose size increases to Large has a space of 10 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet.
  \par If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the kmaximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it -- the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size.
  \par All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly enlarged by the spell. Melee and projectile weapons affected by this spell deal more damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any enlarged item that leaves an enlarged creature's possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage, and projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them. Magical properties of enlarged items are not increased by this spell.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack.
  \par \spellindirect{enlarge person}{Enlarge person} counters and dispels \spell{reduce person}.

\begin{spelleffect}
  Grasses, weeds, bushes, and even trees wrap, twist, and entwine about creatures in the area or those that enter the area, holding them fast and causing them to become entangled. The creature can break free and move half its normal speed by using a standard action to make a combat maneuver check or an Escape Artist check against this spell's save DC. A creature that succeeds on a Reflex save is not entangled but can still move at only half speed through the area. Each round on your turn, the plants once again attempt to entangle all creatures that have avoided or escaped entanglement.

\spelllvl{Drd 4, Nature 4}

\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell functions like \spell{entangle}, except that it affects a wider area and also grows new plants in the area. These plants grow from any terrain, even if it would not normally support plant life, and entangle creatures in the area for the duration of the spell. When the magic fades, the plants with and recede into the ground, leaving no trace that they were ever there.

\begin{spelleffect}
  You become ethereal, along with your equipment. For the duration of the spell, you are in a place called the Ethereal Plane, which overlaps the normal, physical, Material Plane. When the spell expires, you return to material existence.
  \par An ethereal creature is invisible, insubstantial, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down, albeit at half normal speed. As an insubstantial creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear on the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and ephemeral. Sight and hearing onto the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.
  \par Force effects and abjurations affect an ethereal creature normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane (such as a basilisk's gaze attack). Treat other ethereal creatures and ethereal objects as if they were material. 
  \par If you end the spell and become material while inside a material object (such as a solid wall), you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 damage per 5 feet that you so travel.

  A pale glow surrounds and outlines all creatures and objects in the area. Outlined subjects shed light as candles. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness (though a 3rd-level or higher magical darkness effect functions normally), \spell{blur}, \spell{displacement}, \spell{invisibility}, or similar effects. Illusionary figments such as \spell{silent image} are not outlined, which may reveal them for what they are.
  
  The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light. The \spell{faerie fire} can be blue, green, or violet, according to your choice at the time of casting. This spell does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.

However, when the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes.
  \par The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including gear and carried objects up to each creature's maximum load) or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: A Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as two Large creatures or objects, and so forth.
  \par If the spell is cast on a falling item, the object does half normal damage based on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the drop.

  Depending on the version of fire seeds you choose, you turn acorns into splash weapons that you or another character can throw, or you turn holly berries into bombs that you can detonate on command.
  \par \subspell{Acorn Grenades} As many as four acorns turn into special splash weapons that can be hurled as far as 100 feet. A ranged touch attack roll is required to strike the intended target. If you miss, the acorn detonates in a random corner of the intended target square. Together, the acorns are capable of dealing 6d6 fire damage \add d6 per four caster levels above 12th, divided up among the acorns as you wish.
  \par Each acorn explodes upon striking any hard surface, damaging all creatures in a \areasmall radius burst. A creature within this area that makes a successful Reflex saving throw takes only half damage; a creature struck directly is not allowed a saving throw.
  \par \subspell{Holly Berry Bombs} You turn as many as eight holly berries into special bombs. The holly berries are usually placed by hand, since they are too light to make effective thrown weapons (they can be tossed only 5 feet). Together, the holly berries are capable of dealing 6d6 fire damage \add d6 per four caster levels above 12th, divided up among the berries as you wish.
  \par If you are within \rngmed range and speak a word of command (as a standard action), each berry instantly bursts into flame, striking every creature in a \areamed radius burst. A creature in the area that makes a successful Reflex saving throw takes only half damage.

  A 3 foot long beam of red-hot fire springs forth from your hand. In addition to providing illumination like a torch, you can wield this bladelike beam as a weapon. It is treated like a scimitar, except that all damage dealt with it is fire damage, you add half your casting attribute to damage in place of half your Strength, and it is treated as a light weapon, so you can use Dexterity to attack with it. Alternately, you can hurl flames from the weapon up to \rngmed range as if it were a thrown weapon.
\end{spelleffect}

It can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed, and its maneuverability is good. Using a \spell{fly} spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells normally.

\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
  This powerful spell brings into being an immobile, invisible cubical prison composed of either bars of force or solid walls of force (your choice).
  \par Creatures within the area are caught and contained unless they are too big to fit inside, in which case the spell automatically fails. Teleportation and other forms of astral travel provide a means of escape, but the force walls or bars extend into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.
  \par A creature who makes a Reflex save chooses whether it wants to be inside or outside of the forcecage when it forms. The forcecage is formed regardless.
  \par Like a \spell{wall of force} spell, a forcecage resists \spell{dispel magic}, but it is vulnerable to a \spell{disintegrate} spell, and it can be destroyed by a \magicitem{sphere of annihilation} or a \magicitem{rod of cancellation}.
  \par \subspell{Barred Cage} This version of the spell produces a 20-foot cube made of bands of force (similar to a wall of force spell) for bars. The bands are a half-inch wide, with half-inch gaps between them. Any creature capable of passing through such a small space can escape; others are confined. You can't attack a creature in a barred cage with a weapon unless the weapon can fit between the gaps. Even against such weapons (including arrows and similar ranged attacks), a creature in the barred cage has cover. All spells and breath weapons can pass through the gaps in the bars.
  \par \subspell{Windowless Cell} This version of the spell produces a 10-foot cube with no way in and no way out. Solid walls of force form its six sides.
\end{spelleffect}

\spellsection{Forceful Hand}
\spellschool{Evocation (Control) [Force]}
\spelllvl{Evoc 4}
\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell functions like \spell{interposing hand}, except that it can also pursue and bull rush one opponent you select. You must direct the hand to bull rush an opponent as a swift action. If you do, the \spell{forceful hand} may make a bull rush attack that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Its CMA to bull rush equals your caster level \add your casting attribute, \plus4 for being Large. Its CMD is equal to 10 \add its CMA. 
  \par The hand always moves with the opponent to push them back as far as possible. It has no movement limit for this purpose, but it cannot exceed the spell's range.
  \par If you do not direct the hand to bull rush, it simply provides cover as \spell{interposing hand}.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  A very strong creature could not push the hand out of its way because the latter would instantly reposition itself between the creature and you, but an opponent could push the hand up against you by successfully bull rushing it.

In addition, the spell gives the subject a general idea of what action she might take to best protect herself and bestows a \plus5 bonus to Reflex saves and dodge modifier.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  \spell{Foresight} is a difficult spell to cast, since it requires maintaining a constant channel into the future. You may only have one \spell{foresight} spell active at once. If you cast the spell again before the duration wears off, the old spell is dismissed and only the new casting is active.

The subject gains a \plus20 bonus to CMD against grapple attacks, as well as on grapple attacks or Escape Artist checks made to escape a grapple or a pin.

This ice lasts for 5 rounds. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water become trapped in the ice. Attempting to break free is a full-round action. A trapped creature must make a Strength check or an Escape Artist check against this spell's save DC to do so.

\begin{spelleffect}
  The subject and all its gear become insubstantial, misty, and translucent. Its material armor (including natural armor) becomes worthless, though other modifiers continue to apply normally. The subject gains physical damage reduction 10/magic and becomes immune to critical hits. It can't attack or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material, or focus components while in gaseous form. (This does not rule out the use of certain spells that the subject may have prepared using the feats Silent Spell or Still Spell.) If it has a touch spell ready to use, that spell is discharged harmlessly when the gaseous form spell takes effect.
  \par A gaseous creature can't run, but it can fly at a speed of 10 feet (maneuverability perfect). It can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with all it was wearing or holding in its hands, as long as the spell persists. The creature is subject to the effects of wind, and it can't enter water or other liquid. It also can't manipulate objects or activate items, even those carried along with its gaseous form. Continuously active items remain active, though in some cases their effects may be moot.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  This spell's damage reduction allows the subject to ignore the first 10 physical damage it takes each round. If it is hit by a magical attack, such as a damaging spell or magic weapon, it cannot use its damage reduction for 1 round.

  \par Any giant vermin created by this spell do not attempt to harm you, but your control of such creatures is limited to simple commands (``Attack," ``Defend," ``Stop," and so forth). Orders to attack a certain creature when it appears or guard against a particular occurrence are too complex for the vermin to understand. Unless commanded to do otherwise, the giant vermin attack whoever or whatever is near them.

  \par If a magical effect is used against you that would detect your lies or force you to speak the truth the user of the effect must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 \add caster level) against a DC of 15 \add your caster level to succeed. Failure means the effect does not detect your lies or force you to speak only the truth.

  An immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere surrounds you and excludes all spell effects of 3rd level or lower.

Excluded effects include spell-like abilities and spells or spell-like effects from items. However, any type of spell can be cast through or out of the magical globe. Spells of 4th level and higher are not affected by the globe, nor are spells already in effect when the globe is cast. The globe can be brought down by a \spell{dispel magic} spell or similar effects. You can leave and return to the globe without penalty.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  Spell effects are not disrupted unless their effects enter the globe, and even then they are merely suppressed, not dispelled.

  This spell functions like \spell{interposing hand}, except the hand can also grapple one opponent that you select. You must direct the hand to grapple an opponent as a swift action. If you do, the \spell{grasping hand} may make a grapple attack as a swift action. Its CMA to grapple equals your caster level \add your casting attribute, \plus4 for being Large. Its CMD is equal to 10 \add its CMA.
  \par The hand holds but does not harm creatures it grapples. While the hand is grappling a foe, you must spend a swift action each round to sustain the hand's grapple; otherwise, the grappled creature escapes automatically.
  \par If you do not direct the hand to bull rush, it simply provides cover as \spell{interposing hand}.

\begin{spelleffect}
  Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful Reflex save or fall. A creature can walk within or through the area of grease at half normal speed with a DC 10 Balance check. Failure means it can't move that round, while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Balance skill for details). A creature standing in a greased area loses its Dexterity and dodge modifiers to AC due to the slippery surface.
  \par The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item. Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while an object wielded or employed by a creature receives a Reflex saving throw to avoid the effect entirely. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. If the item is successfully greased, a saving throw must be made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the greased item. A creature wearing greased armor or clothing gains a \plus10 bonus on Escape Artist checks and on grapple attacks made to resist or escape a grapple or to escape a pin.

  This spell creates a severe blast of air (approximately 50 mph) that originates from you, affecting all creatures in its path. Creatures are affected according to their size category. A successful Fortitude save causes a creature to be affected as if it were one size category larger. Flying creatures are affected as if one size category smaller.
  \begin{itemize*}
    \item Tiny or smaller creatures are knocked prone and blown to the edge of the spell's range.
    \item Small creatures are knocked prone by the force of the wind.
    \item Medium creatures are unable to move forward against the force of the wind.
    \item Large or larger creatures may move normally.
  \end{itemize*}
  \par Any creature, regardless of size, takes a \minus4 penalty on ranged attacks and Listen checks in the spell's area.
  \par In addition to the effects noted, a gust of wind can do anything that a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do. It can extinguish open flames, create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings or hangings, heel over a small boat, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of its range.

\begin{spelleffect}
  The creature or object touched becomes invisible, vanishing from sight, even from darkvision. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too.
  \par Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 5 feet from it becomes visible.
  \par Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle). The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions.) Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as \spell{bless} that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.

Any affected creature moving out of the area becomes visible, but creatures moving into the area after the spell is cast do not become invisible.

  \par Your weight increases by a factor of ten, causing you to sink in water like a stone. However, you could survive the crushing pressure and lack of air at the bottom of the ocean -- at least until the spell duration expires.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  This spell's damage reduction allows the subject to ignore the first 15 physical damage it takes each round. If it is hit by an adamantine weapon, it cannot use its damage reduction for 1 round.

\begin{spelleffect}
  The knock spell telekinetically opens stuck, barred, locked, held, or arcane locked objects. If the object is stuck or held, you can immediately make an Strength check to break it open, using your caster level instead of your Strength. Others can aid you on this check as normal. In addition, if the object is locked, you can immediately make a Disable Device check to open the lock as if you had rolled a 20 on the check. You get a bonus on the Disable Device check equal to half your caster level.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  If knock is cast on an \spellindirect{arcane lock}{arcane locked} door, make a caster level check against a DC of 11 \add the caster level of the \spell{arcane lock}. If you succeed, the \spell{arcane lock} is suppressed for 10 minutes. If you fail, you may still bypass the door with the checks above, if possible.

\spellsection{Lesser (Spell Name)}
\par Any spell whose name begins with lesser is alphabetized in this chapter according to the second word of the spell name. Thus, the description of a lesser spell appears near the description of the spell on which it is based.

\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell allows you to telekinetically move the subject up and down as you wish. A creature must be willing to be levitated, and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. You can mentally direct the recipient to move up or down as much as 20 feet each round; doing so is a swift action. You cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face of a cliff, for example, or push against a ceiling to move laterally (generally at half its base land speed).

  This spell functions like \spell{magic missile}, except that the spell creates three missiles that automatically seek out living creatures in the area. Each missile deals 1d10 force damage. If you specify a target for a missile, it will strike the target. Otherwise, it will strike a living creature within the area.
  
  \spell{Invisibility}, \spell{displacement}, and any other forms of cover or concealment do not fool the missiles. You can form one additional missile per four caster levels above 6th.

  As a swift action, you can suppress or intensify the light, preventing the object from shedding light or causing it to shed light in up to a \arealarge radius (and dim light for an additional 50 feet). Either effect lasts for 1 round.

  You release a powerful stroke of electrical energy that deals damage to each creature within its area. The bolt begins at your fingertips.
  \par The lightning bolt sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its path. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the bolt may continue beyond the barrier if the spell's range permits; otherwise, it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.

\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  A limited wish lets you create nearly any type of effect. For example, a limited wish can do any of the following things.
  \begin{itemize*}
    \item Duplicate any general sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.
    \item Duplicate any general sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th level or lower, even if it's of a prohibited school.
    \item Duplicate any other spell of 4th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.
    \item Duplicate any other spell of 3rd level or lower, even if it's of a prohibited school.
    \item Undo the harmful effects of many spells, such as geas/quest or insanity.
    \item Produce any other effect whose power level is in line with the above effects, such as a single creature automatically hitting on its next attack or taking a \minus5 penalty on its next saving throw.
  \end{itemize*}
  \par When casting a limited wish, you do not specify the exact spell or effect you wish to duplicate. Instead, you make a wish, describing what you want to have happen, and make a DC 15 Wisdom check. If the check fails, your intent is redirected or perverted in some way. For example, a \spell{limited wish} to turn a foe to stone would normally mimic the \spell{flesh to stone} effect of the \spell{transmute flesh and stone} spell. However, if the Wisdom check failed, your foe might gain the benefit of a \spell{stoneskin} spell instead.
  \par A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal for the spell. When a limited wish spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 1,000 gp, you must provide that component (in addition to the 1,500 gp cost for this spell).

  You temporarily link the fates of any two creatures, if both fail their saving throws. If either linked creature experiences pain, both feel it. When one loses hit points, the other loses the same amount. If one takes nonlethal damage, so does the other. Likewise, when one regains hit points, the other heals the same amount. Excess healing is simply lost. If one creature is subjected to an effect to which it is immune (such as a type of energy damage), the linked creature is not subjected to it.

  \par You slowly turn and sense when you are facing in the direction of the creature to be located, provided it is within range. You also know in which direction the creature is moving, if any.
  \par The spell can locate a creature of a specific kind or a specific creature known to you. It cannot find a creature of a certain type. To find a kind of creature, you must have seen such a creature up close (within 30 feet) at least once.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  Detection spells spell are blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt. In addition, running water blocks \spell{locate creature}. It cannot detect objects. It can be fooled by \spell{mislead} and \spell{nondetection} spells.

\begin{spelleffect}
  You sense the direction of a well-known or clearly visualized object. You can search for general items, in which case you locate the nearest one of its kind if more than one is within range. Attempting to find a certain item requires a specific and accurate mental image; if the image is not close enough to the actual object, the spell fails. You cannot specify a unique item unless you have observed that particular item firsthand (not through divination).
\end{spelleffect}

\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  This armor is treated as a separate piece or armor from any other armor the creature is wearing, so it does not stack with any existing armor modifier. Since \spell{mage armor} is made of force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor.
  
  If you become subject to the \spell{shield} spell during the duration of this spell, the \spell{shield} spell lasts until this spell's duration ends.

\begin{spelleffect}
  All magical effects within the radius of the spell, except for those on you, are disjoined. That is, spells and spell-like effects are separated into their individual components (ending the effect as a \spell{dispel magic} spell does).
  \par You also have a 2\% chance per caster level of destroying an \spell{antimagic field}.
  \par You can also use this spell to target a single item. The item gets a Will save at a \minus5 penalty to avoid being permanently rendered nonmagical. Even artifacts are subject to this use of disjunction, though there is only a 1\% chance per caster level of actually affecting such powerful items. Additionally, if an artifact is destroyed, you permanently lose the ability to cast \spell{mage's disjunction}. (This ability cannot be recovered by mortal magic, not even \spell{miracle} or \spell{wish}.)
  \par \subspell{Note} Destroying artifacts is a dangerous business, and it is 95\% likely to attract the attention of some powerful being who has an interest in or connection with the device.

\spelleff{One sword}
\spelldur{\durshort (D)}
\spellsave{None}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell brings into being a shimmering, swordlike plane of force. The sword strikes at any opponent within its range, as you desire, starting in the round that you cast the spell. The sword attacks its designated target once each round on your turn. Its attack bonus is equal to your caster level \add your casting attribute. It deals 4d6 points of force damage \add half your casting attribute \add 1d6 per four caster levels above 14th, with a threat range of 19--20 and a critical multiplier of \mtimes2.
  \par The sword always strikes from your direction. It does not contribute to overwhelm penalties, but it benefits from any that exist. If the sword goes beyond the spell range from you, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the sword returns to you and hovers.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  Each round after the first, you can redirect the sword to a new target as a swift action. If you do not, the sword continues to attack the previous round's target.
  \par As a force effect, the sword can strike ethereal and incorporeal creatures. It cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but \spell{dispel magic}, \spell{disintegrate}, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it. The sword's AC is 10 (10, \plus0 size bonus for being a Medium object)
  \par If an attacked creature has spell resistance, the resistance is checked the first time \spell{mage's sword} strikes it. If the sword is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the sword has its full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.

  You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike (instead, see \spell{magic fang}). A monk's unarmed strike is considered a weapon, and thus it can be enhanced by this spell.
  \par If you use this spell to enhance projectiles, the projectiles must be of the same kind, and they have to be together (in the same quiver or other container).

\begin{spelleffect}
  You banish the subject into an extradimensional labyrinth of force planes. Each round on its turn, it may attempt a DC 20 Intelligence check to escape the labyrinth as a full-round action. If the subject doesn't escape, the maze disappears after 5 minutes, forcing the subject back to the location where it was originally banished. A successful Will save prevents you from placing it in the middle of the labyrinth, lowering the DC of the Intelligence check to 15.
  \par On escaping or leaving the maze, the subject reappears where it had been when the maze spell was cast. If this location is filled with a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest open space.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as \spell{teleport} and \spell{dimension door}, do not help a creature escape a \spell{maze} spell, although a \spell{plane shift} spell allows it to exit to whatever plane is designated in that spell.

  This spell enables you to meld your body and possessions into a single block of stone. The stone must be large enough to accommodate your body in all three dimensions. When the casting is complete, you and not more than 100 pounds of nonliving gear merge with the stone. If either condition is violated, the spell fails and is wasted.
  \par While in the stone, you remain in contact, however tenuous, with the face of the stone through which you melded. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while hiding in the stone. Nothing that goes on outside the stone can be seen, but you can still hear what happens around you. Minor physical damage to the stone does not harm you, but its partial destruction (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. The stone's complete destruction expels you and slays you instantly unless you make a DC 20 Fortitude save.
  \par Any time before the duration expires, you can step out of the stone through the surface that you entered. If the spell's duration expires or the effect is dispelled before you voluntarily exit the stone, you are violently expelled and take 5d6 points of damage.

  You can whisper messages and receive whispered replies with little chance of being overheard. You point your finger at each creature you want to receive the message. When you whisper, the whispered message is audible to all targeted creatures within range. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal (or a thin sheet of lead), or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks the spell. The message does not have to travel in a straight line. It can circumvent a barrier if there is an open path between you and the subject, and the path's entire length lies within the spell's range. The creatures that receive the message can whisper a reply that you hear. The spell transmits sound, not meaning. It doesn't transcend language barriers.

\begin{spelleffect}
  You don't so much cast a miracle as request one. You state what you would like to have happen and request that your deity (or the power you pray to for spells) intercede.
  \par A miracle can do any of the following things.
  \begin{itemize*}
    \item Duplicate any cleric spell of 8th level or lower (including spells to which you have access because of your domains). 
    \item Duplicate any other spell of 7th level or lower.
    \item Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as feeblemind or insanity.
    \item Have any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.
  \end{itemize*}
  \par Alternatively, a cleric can make a very powerful request. Examples of especially powerful miracles of this sort could include the following.
  \begin{itemize*}
    \item Swiinging the tide of a battle in your favor by raising fallen allies to continue fighting.
    \item Moving you and your allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to another through planar barriers to a specific locale with no chance of error.
    \item Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster.
  \end{itemize*}
  \par In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity's (or alignment's) nature is refused.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  If you request a miracle, your deity (or the power you pray to) will expect something of you in return. You must cast commune to learn what this is within 24 hours, or you will lose the ability to cast any cleric spells other than commune. For more moderate miracles, you may be required to offer 25,000gp worth of incense and gems. For especially powerful miracles, or multiple moderate miracles, you may geased with a task to complete.
  \par A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DCs are as for a 9th-level spell. When a miracle spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 10,000 gp, you must provide that component.

\spelltgt{You}
\spelldur{\durshort (D)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell creates an illusory duplicate of yourself that mimics your movements perfectly. Enemies attempting to attack you or cast spells at you must select which to attack. Generally, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. An image's AC is 10 \add your size modifier. You gain an additional image at 8th, 14th, and 20th level. 
  \par If an image is hit, it is destroyed. If you are hit, your attacker knows the attack was successful, and can ignore the image. You can create new images to replace destroyed images as a swift action, preventing your foes from knowing which image to attack.
  \par You can move into and through your duplicates on your turn. When you and the image separate, observers can't use vision or hearing to tell which one is you and which the image. The duplicates may also move through each other. The figments mimic your actions, pretending to cast spells when you cast a spell, drink potions when you drink a potion, levitate when you levitate, and so on.
  \par Mirror images can be attacked like any other creature. They count as separate creatures, and can be targeted separately by spells like \spell{magic missile} or feats like Whirlwind Attack, though they are not destroyed by area spells. Destroying an image counts as dropping a creature for the purpose of the Cleave feat and similar abilities.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  An attacker must be able to see the images to be fooled. If you are invisible or an attacker shuts his or her eyes, the spell has no effect. (Being unable to see carries the same penalties as being blinded.)

  You become invisible (as \spell{invisibility}, a glamer), and at the same time, an illusory double of you (as \spell{major image}, an unreal figment) appears. You are then free to go elsewhere while your double moves away. The double appears within range but thereafter moves as you direct it (which requires concentration beginning on the first round after the casting). You can make the figment appear superimposed perfectly over your own body so that observers don't notice an image appearing and you turning invisible. You and the figment can then move in different directions. The double moves at your speed and can talk and gesture as if it were real, but it cannot attack or cast spells, though it can pretend to do so.
  \par The illusory double lasts as long as you concentrate upon it, plus 5 additional rounds. After you cease concentration, the illusory double continues to carry out the same activity until the duration expires. The invisibility lasts for 5 minutes, regardless of concentration.

  You reach into the subject's mind and modify as many as 5 minutes of its memories in one of the following ways.
  \begin{itemize*}
    \item Eliminate all memory of an event the subject actually experienced. This spell cannot negate charm, geas/quest, suggestion, or similar spells.
    \item Allow the subject to recall with perfect clarity an event it actually experienced.
    \item Change the details of an event the subject actually experienced.
    \item Implant a memory of an event the subject never experienced.
  \end{itemize*}
  \par Casting the spell takes 1 round. If the subject fails to save, you proceed with the spell by spending as much as 5 minutes (a period of time equal to the amount of memory time you want to modify) visualizing the memory you wish to modify in the subject. If your concentration is disturbed before the visualization is complete, or if the subject is ever beyond the spell's range during this time, the spell is lost.
  \par A modified memory does not necessarily affect the subject's actions, particularly if it contradicts the creature's natural inclinations. An illogical modified memory is dismissed by the creature as a bad dream or a memory muddied by too much wine.

\begin{spelleffect}
  This power transforms your body into living oak, which grants you several advantages.
  \par You gain physical damage reduction 15/fire or adamantine and a \plus5 bonus to natural armor. You are immune to ability damage, blindness, deafness, disease, drowning, poison, stunning, and all spells or attacks that affect your physiology or respiration, because you have no physiology or respiration while this power is in effect.
  \par You take only half damage from cold effects of all kinds. However, you become susceptible to all special attacks that affect wood, and you gain vulnerability to fire.
  \par You gain a \plus4 bonus to Strength and Constitution, but you take a \minus2 penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum Dexterity score of \minus9), and your speed is reduced to half normal. You can speak but cannot drink (and thus can't use potions). You have an armor check penalty of \minus4 and an arcane spell failure chance of 25%.
  \par Your unarmed attacks deal damage equal to a club sized for you (1d4 for Small characters, 1d6 for Medium characters), and you are considered armed when making unarmed attacks. When you make a full attack against an object or structure using your unarmed strike, you deal double damage.
\end{spelleffect}

If the wall's thickness is more than the depth of the passage created, then a single \spell{passwall} simply makes a niche or short tunnel. Several \spell{passwall} spells can then form a continuing passage to breach very thick walls. When \spell{passwall} ends, creatures within the passage are ejected out the nearest exit.

A phantom steed has a speed of 10 feet per two caster levels. It can bear its rider's weight plus up to 10 pounds per caster level.
  \par These mounts gain certain powers according to caster level. A mount's abilities include those of mounts of lower caster levels.

  This spell creates an ethereal passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not other materials. The phase door is invisible and inaccessible to all creatures except you, and only you can use the passage. It can be used a number of times equal to half your caster level before the spell ends. You disappear when you enter the phase door and appear when you exit. If you desire, you can take one other creature (Medium or smaller) through the door. This counts as two uses of the door. The door does not allow light, sound, or spell effects through it, nor can you see through it without using it. Thus, the spell can provide an escape route, though certain creatures, such as phase spiders, can follow with ease.
  \par You can allow other creatures to use the phase door by setting some triggering condition for the door. Such conditions can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. They can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Values, and hit points don't qualify.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  The \spell{true seeing} spell or similar magic reveals the presence of a phase door but does not allow its use. A \spell{phase door} is subject to \spell{dispel magic}. If anyone is within the passage when it is dispelled, he is harmlessly ejected just as if he were inside a \spell{passwall} effect.

A winged creature flying in the air at the time that it becomes paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A paralyzed swimmer can't swim and may drown.

\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell creates a vertical, opaque wall -- a shimmering, multicolored plane of light that protects you from all forms of attack. The wall flashes with seven colors, each of which has a distinct power and purpose. The wall is immobile, and you can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. However, any other creature with less than 8 HV that is within 20 feet of the wall is blinded for 1 minute by the colors if it looks at the wall.
  \par The wall's maximum proportions are 50 feet wide and 30 feet high. A \spell{prismatic wall} spell cast to materialize in a space occupied by a creature is disrupted, and the spell is wasted.
  \par Each color in the wall has a special effect. The accompanying table shows the seven colors of the wall, the order in which they appear, their effects on creatures trying to attack you or pass through the wall, and the magic needed to negate each color.
  \par The wall can be destroyed, color by color, in consecutive order, by various magical effects; however, the first color must be brought down before the second can be affected, and so on. A rod of cancellation or a mage's disjunction spell destroys a prismatic wall, but an antimagic field fails to penetrate it. Dispel magic and greater dispel magic cannot dispel the wall or anything beyond it. Spell resistance is effective against a prismatic wall, but the caster level check must be repeated for each color present.

  You tap energy from the Plane of Shadow to create a quasi-real, illusory version of yourself. The projected image looks, sounds, and smells like you but is intangible. The projected image mimics your actions (including speech) unless you direct it to act differently (which is a move action).
  \par You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were standing where it is, and during your turn you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again, as a swift action. While you are using its senses, your body is considered blinded and deafened.
  \par If you desire, any spell you cast whose range is touch or greater can originate from the projected image instead of from you.

  This spell reverses gravity in an area, causing all unattached objects and creatures within that area to fall upward and reach the top of the area in 1 round. If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it in the same manner as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, until the spell ends. At the end of the spell duration, affected objects and creatures fall downward.
  \par A creature caught in the area can attempt a Reflex save to react to the shift in gravity. Common reactions include securing oneself if possible, or jumping to reach more stable ground.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  Creatures who can fly or levitate can keep themselves from falling, though the shift in gravity can be disorienting. A creature that reacts by jumping does not actually move until its turn, but it moves in the direction of its jump, rather than simply falling upwards.

However, the spell must be cast within one round of the creature's death per four caster levels. After that time, it has no effect (and the material components are not consumed).

  The creature has 0 hit points and 1 point of critical damage (but is stable) after being restored to life.

\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell functions like \spell{enlarge person}, except that it affects only you, regardless of your creature type. In addition, you gain a \plus4 bonus to Strength (which replaces the bonus to Strength from \spell{enlarge person}) and physical damage reduction equal to 10 \add 1 per two caster levels above 10th. This damage reduction is overcome evil attacks if you are good or neutral, and by good attacks if you are evil.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  This spell's damage reduction allows the subject to ignore the first 10 physical damage it takes each round. If it is hit by an attack that deals appropriately aligned damage, such as a weapon affected by \spell{align weapon} or a spell with the appropriate descriptor, it cannot use its damage reduction for 1 round.
  Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack.

  Any opponent attempting to strike or otherwise directly attack the shielded creature, even with a targeted spell, must attempt a Will save. If the save succeeds, the opponent can attack normally and is unaffected by that casting of the spell. If the save fails, the opponent can't follow through with the attack, that part of its action is lost, and it can't directly attack the shielded creature for the duration of the spell. Those not attempting to attack the subject remain unaffected. This spell does not prevent the shielded creature from being attacked or affected by area or effect spells. The subject cannot attack without breaking the spell but may use nonattack spells or otherwise act.

  You grant the touched creature the ability to see any objects or beings that are invisible within its range of vision, as well as any that are ethereal, as if they were normally visible. Such creatures are visible as translucent shapes, allowing the target to easily discern the difference between visible, invisible, and ethereal creatures.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  The spell does not reveal the method used to obtain invisibility. It does not reveal illusions or enable you to see through opaque objects. It does not reveal creatures who are simply hiding, concealed, or otherwise hard to see.

\spelldur{\durmed (D)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  Your body and all your equipment are subsumed by your shadow. As a living shadow, you blend perfectly into any other shadow and vanish in darkness. You appear as an unattached shadow in areas of full light.
  \par You can move at your normal speed, on any surface, including walls and ceilings, as well as across the surfaces of liquids -- even up the face of a waterfall.
  \par Your space does not change, so you cannot move into locations you would not normally be able to move into.
  \par While in your shadow body, you gain damage reduction 15/solar and darkvision out to 60 feet. You are immune to ability damage, disease, drowning, and poison. You take only half damage from acid, electricity, and fire of all kinds.
  \par While affected by this spell, you can be detected by spells that read thoughts, life, or presences (including true seeing), or if you make suspicious movements in lighted areas.
  \par You cannot harm anyone physically or manipulate any objects, but you can use your spells normally. Doing so may attract notice, but if you remain in a shadowed area, you get a \plus15 bonus on your Hide check to remain unnoticed.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  This spell's damage reduction allows the subject to ignore the first 15 physical damage it takes each round. If it is hit by an attack that deals solar damage, such as \spell{sunbeam}, it cannot use its damage reduction for 1 round.

\begin{spelleffect}
  Shadow conjuration can mimic any non-restricted sorcerer or wizard conjuration (summoning) or conjuration (creation) spell of 3rd level or lower. If you summon a creature, as with the \spell{summon monster} spells, you may only summon a creature that you know how to summon with such a spell.
  \par Shadow conjurations are actually half as strong as the real things, though creatures who believe the shadow conjurations to be real are affected by them at full strength.
  \par Any creature that interacts with the conjured object, force, or creature can make a Will save to recognize its true nature.
  \par Spells that deal damage have normal effects unless an affected creature succeeds on a Will save. Each disbelieving creature takes only half damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is half as strong (if applicable) or only half as likely to occur. Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save (or spell resistance) that the spell being simulated allows.
  \par A shadow creature has half the hit points of a normal creature of its kind (regardless of whether it's recognized as shadowy). It deals normal damage and has all normal abilities and weaknesses. Against a creature that recognizes it as a shadow creature, however, the shadow creature deals half damage, and all special abilities that do not deal lethal damage are only 50\% likely to work. (Roll for each use and each affected character separately.)
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  A creature that succeeds on its save sees the shadow conjurations as transparent images superimposed on vague, shadowy forms.
  \par When you learn this spell, you choose three creatures from the 3rd-level or lower lists on the Summon Monster table, one at each level. You can summon those creatures with this or any summon monster spell.
  \par Objects automatically succeed on their Will saves against this spell.

  \par Spells that deal damage have normal effects unless an affected creature succeeds on a Will save. Each disbelieving creature takes only half damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is half as strong (if applicable) or only half as likely to occur.

The double appears superimposed over your body so that observers don't notice an image appearing and you disappearing. You can then control the image and cast spells through it even though you are on a different plane.

  This spell creates a connection between you and a willing subject. As you cast the spell, you decide whether you will take half of the subject's damage, or whether the subject will take half of your damage. All attacks that deal hit point damage are redirected in this way, but no other forms of attack, including critical damage and ability damage, are redirected.
  
  If the subject is out of range of you, the spell is suppressed until the subject returns within the spell's range.

  Used as an area attack, shatter destroys nonmagical objects of crystal, glass, ceramic, or porcelain. All such objects within a \areasmall radius of the point of origin are smashed into dozens of pieces by the spell. Objects weighing more than 1 pound per your level are not affected, but all other objects of the appropriate composition are shattered.
  \par Alternatively, you can target a single solid object or crystalline creature. In the case of large objects, such as walls, you target a 5 ft. cube. The target takes damage, with a Fortitude save for half damage.
  \par A creature holding vulnerable objects can attempt a Will save to negate any effect on to those objects.

\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  This shield is considered to be separate from any other shields the creature is using, so it never stacks with existing shield modifiers. Since the \spell{shield} is made of force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal shields.
  
  If you cast this spell on a creature subject to the \spell{mage armor} spell, its duration lasts until the \spell{mage armor} spell expires.

  \par First, each shielded creature gains a \plus5 bonus to its saving throws.
  \par Second, each shielded creature gains spell resistance 10 against chaotic spells and spells cast by chaotic creatures.
  \par Third, the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence, just as \spell{protection from chaos} does.

\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
   A staggered character may take a single move action or standard action each round, but not both. She cannot take full-round actions, but she may take swift actions. In addition, she is vulnerable, causing her to take a \minus2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, checks, DCs, and AC.

\begin{spelleffect}
  You are able to shrink one nonmagical item to 1/16 of its normal size in each dimension (to about 1/4,000 the original volume and mass). This change effectively reduces the object's size by four categories. Optionally, you can also change its now shrunken composition to a clothlike one. Objects changed by a \spell{shrink item} spell can be returned to normal composition and size merely by tossing them onto any solid surface or by a word of command from the original caster. The object must be resting on a stable surface to return to its original size; if the command word is spoken while the object is not stable (such as while it is in the air), the object returns to its original size as soon as it finds a resting point. Even a burning fire and its fuel can be shrunk by this spell. Restoring the shrunken object to its normal size and composition ends the spell.
  \par You can shrink a Medium object at 8th level, a Large object at 12th level, a Huge object at 16th level, or a Gargantuan object at 24th level.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  \spellindirect{shrink item}{Shrink item} can be made permanent with a \spell{permanency} spell, in which case the affected object can be shrunk and expanded an indefinite number of times, but only by the original caster.

  Upon the casting of this spell, complete silence prevails in the affected area. No sound can be heard or made in the area, but sound passes through the area normally. Spellcasters are treated as being deafened for the purpose of casting spells with verbal components, and suffer a 20\% chance of spell failure. The spell can be cast on a point in space, but the effect is stationary unless cast on a mobile object. The spell can be centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature who enters the spell's area can attempt a Will save to negate the spell's effect on them and can use spell resistance, if any. A creature who successfully resists the spell can hear and make sound normally, but still cannot be hear or be heard by other creatures in the area (unless they also resisted the spell). Items in a creature's possession or magic items that emit sound receive the benefits of saves and spell resistance, but unattended objects and points in space do not. 
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  This spell provides a defense against sound-dependent effects. Sonic effects are too powerful for magic such as this to muffle, and function normally.

\begin{spelleffect}
  When this spell is cast, all natural, undressed earth or stone in the spell's area is softened. Wet earth becomes thick mud, dry earth becomes loose sand or dirt, and stone becomes soft clay that is easily molded or chopped. You affect a 10-foot square area to a depth of 1 to 4 feet, depending on the toughness or resilience of the ground at that spot. Magical, enchanted, dressed, or worked stone cannot be affected. Earth or stone creatures are not affected.
  \par A creature in mud must succeed on a Reflex save or be caught for 1 round and unable to move, attack, or cast spells. A creature that succeeds on its save can move through the mud at half speed, and it can't run or charge.
  \par Loose dirt is not as troublesome as mud, but All creatures within the area can move at only half their normal speed and can't run or charge over the surface.
  \par Stone softened into clay does not hinder movement, but it does allow characters to cut, shape, or excavate areas they may not have been able to affect before.
  \par While \spell{soften earth and stone} does not affect dressed or worked stone, cavern ceilings or vertical surfaces such as cliff faces can be affected. Usually, this causes a moderate collapse or landslide as the loosened material peels away from the face of the wall or roof and falls.
  \par A moderate amount of structural damage can be dealt to a manufactured structure by softening the ground beneath it, causing it to settle. However, most well-built structures will only be damaged by this spell, not destroyed.

  This spell functions like \spell{fog cloud}, but in addition to obscuring sight, the fog is so thick that any creature attempting to move through it progresses at a speed of 5 feet, regardless of its normal speed, and it takes a \minus2 penalty on all melee attack and melee damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into solid fog is slowed, so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces falling damage by 1d6.
  \par A creature in the fog can take a full-round action to make a Strength check, moving 5 feet for every 5 by which the result exceeds DC 0. This movement is affected by any other effects which impede movement, as normal.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  A severe wind (31\add mph) disperses the fog in 5 rounds, and a hurricane force wind disperses the fog in 1 round.
  \par Solid fog can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent solid fog dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.

(Roll to determine each creature's behavior every round at the beginning of its turn.) A creature that does not attack its nearest neighbor is free to act normally for that round. After each round that a subject is compelled to attack the nearest target, it may make a saving throw to throw off the effect.
  \par Creatures forced by a \spell{song of discord} to attack their fellows employ all methods at their disposal, choosing their deadliest spells and most advantageous combat tactics. They do not, however, harm targets that have fallen unconscious.

The subject gains a climb speed of 20 feet; furthermore, it need not make Climb checks to traverse a vertical or horizontal surface (even upside down).

  Any ground-covering vegetation in the spell's area becomes very hard and sharply pointed. In areas of bare earth, roots and rootlets act in the same way. Typically, spike growth can be cast in any outdoor setting except open water, ice, heavy snow, sandy desert, or bare stone. Any foe moving on foot into or through the spell's area takes 1d4 points of physical piercing damage for each 5 feet of movement through the spiked area. Allies suffer no ill effects.
  \par Any creature that takes damage from this spell must also succeed on a Reflex save or suffer injuries to its feet and legs that slow its land speed by one-half. The Reflex save must be repeated each round that the creature moves through the area. This speed penalty lasts for 12 hours or until the injured creature receives magical healing. Another character can remove the penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell's save DC.

\begin{spelleffect}
  The weapon created by this spell attacks once each round on your turn. This functions just as if you were attacking with the weapon, except that you use your casting ability in place of your Strength and you never get multiple attacks with the weapon.
  \par The weapon attacks the same target until you redirect it (a swift action). The weapon is treated as a separate creature for the purpose of overwhelm penalties.
  \par If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a spell penetration check the first time the spiritual weapon strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, it cannot harm that creature. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.
  \par The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you (see below), and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  The \spell{spiritual weapon} strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so, for example, ignores physical damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the normal miss chance associated with incorporeality. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers. Even if the spiritual weapon is a ranged weapon, use the spell's range, not the weapon's normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action.
  \par A \spell{spiritual weapon} cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but \spell{dispel magic}, \spell{disintegrate}, and similar effects can affect it. A spiritual weapon's AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 \add size bonus for Tiny object).
  \par The weapon that you get is usually a force replica of any weapon from your deity's weapon group. A cleric without a deity gets a weapon based on his alignment. A neutral cleric without a deity can create a spiritual weapon of any alignment, provided he is acting at least generally in accord with that alignment at the time. The weapon groups associated with each alignment are as follows.
  \par Chaos: Axes
  \par Evil: Flexible weapons
  \par Good: Headed weapons
  \par Law: Heavy blades

  This spell summons a stampede of nine bison to trample your foes. Creatures trampled by the herd of bison take 1d6 damage per bison in the herd. You can summon one additional bison per four levels above 18th.
  \par The bison are summoned in a place that you designate within the spell's area, with each creature being summoned in the closest free space to the point of origin. If there is insufficient room for all of the bison to appear while standing on stable ground, the spell will summon fewer bison than the maximum. The herd of bison always moves directly away from you, trampling anything of Large size or smaller that gets in their way. If the herd is thinned to fewer than 5 bison, they stop stampeding and scatter in random directions.
  \par The bison do not attack, even if cornered; they will only stampede. At the end of the spell's duration, the bison disappear.

  This spell creates an enormous black storm cloud. Lightning and crashing claps of thunder appear within the storm. Each creature beneath the cloud must succeed on a Fortitude save or be deafened for 5 minutes. Violent rain and wind gusts obscure all sight beyond 100 feet. A creature less than 100 feet away has concealment (\plus4 AC). Ranged attacks within the area of the storm take a \minus4 penalty, and spells cast within the area are disrupted unless the caster succeeds on a Concentration check against a DC equal to 20 \add double the level of the spell.
  \par If you do not maintain concentration on the spell after casting it, the spell ends. If you continue to concentrate, the spell generates new effects in each following round, as noted below. Each effect occurs during your turn.
  \par 2nd Round: Acid rains down, dealing 1d10 acid damage to everything in the area (no save).
  \par 3rd Round: You call three bolts of lightning down from the cloud. You decide where the bolts strike. No two bolts may strike the same target. Each bolt deals 9d6 electricity damage \add d6 per four levels after 18th. A creature struck can attempt a Reflex save for half damage. If you do not direct the lightning bolts, each bolt automatically targets the largest available target in the area.
  \par 4th Round: Hailstones rain down, dealing 5d6 bludgeoning damage to all enemies in the area.

\begin{spelleffect}
  You influence the actions of the target creature by suggesting a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two). The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do some obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell. Additionally, any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the fascinated creature, grants the creature a new saving throw with a \plus5 bonus.
  \par The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell duration expires, the activity is not performed.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  A very reasonable suggestion can cause the save to be made with a \minus2 or greater penalty. A creature that makes its saving throw against \spell{suggestion} is immune to all further attempts by the same spellcaster for 24 hours.

  This spell summons an extraplanar creature (typically an outsider, elemental, or magical beast native to another plane). It appears where you designate and acts on your next turn. You must spend a swift action each round to control the creature summoned by this spell. If you do, it attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. You can direct the creature not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions if you can communicate with it. If you do not actively control the creature summoned by this spell, it acts according to its nature.
  \par When you learn this spell, you choose a creature from the 1st-level list on the Summon Monster table. In the case of creatures with multiple options, such as elementals, you must choose one specific kind of creature. You can summon that creature with this or any other summon monster spell.
  \par A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them.
  \par When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.

  You may manipulate objects or creatures at a distance as if you were holding the object in your hands. When doing so, your effective Strength is equal to half your casting attribute, and your effective Dexterity is equal to half your Intelligence. You can move objects at a speed of up to 20 feet per round in any direction.

   A creature can negate the effect on itself or an object it possesses with a successful Will save. Each round, the subject can attempt a new saving throw to negate the effect. If you are prevented from affecting a target in this way, it and any of its possessions are immune to your attempts for the duration of the spell, though you can still attempt to affect other creatures or objects. 
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  This spell generally moves objects too slowly for them to be used as weapons. However, some indirect weapons, such as crossbows, may be used to attack with this spell.

  \par You must succeed on ranged attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target of the hurled items with the items, applying your caster level and casting attribute to the attack roll instead of your base attack bonus and Dexterity. Hurled weapons deal their normal damage. Other objects deal damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds of weight (for less dangerous objects such as an empty barrel) to 1d6 points per 25 pounds of weight (for hard, dense objects such as a boulder).
  \par Creatures are allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to avoid being hurled or having their held possessions be targeted by this power.

  This spell seems to make time cease to flow for everyone but you. In fact, you step into an alternate timestream, causing you to speed up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen, though they are actually still moving at their normal speeds. You are free to act for 1d3\plus1 rounds of apparent time. You are still vulnerable to danger, such as from heat or dangerous gases, but your actions have no effect on anything in the world other than yourself. Objects and creatures appear frozen in place. You cannot cast spells that affect any targets except yourself; the temporal magic is too strong to permit interference from lesser magic, and attempts to cast magic beyond the accelerated time surrounding you simply fail. The only exception is for temporal spells, which can be cast normally inside a \spell{time stop}. The subjects are not affected and do not attempt to resist the effects until the end of the \spell{time stop}, so you do not know whether they are affected by any spells you cast until the effect has expired.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  Most spellcasters use the additional time to improve their defenses or flee from combat. You are undetectable while \spell{time stop} lasts. You cannot enter an area protected by an \spell{antimagic field} while under the effect of \spell{time stop}.

  This spell has different effects depending on the version chosen.
  \par \subspell{Flesh to Stone} The subject is slowed for the duration of the spell, and takes 3d8 physical damage each round as its body gradually turns to stone. A Fortitude save negates this effect. If the subject reaches 0 hit points before the spell ends, it becomes a mindless, inert statue, along with all its carried gear. If the statue resulting from this effect is broken or damaged, the subject (if ever returned to its original state) has similar damage or deformities. The creature is not dead, but it is not considered alive either.
  \par Only creatures made of flesh are affected by this effect.
  \par \subspell{Stone to Flesh} This effect restores a petrified creature to its normal state, restoring life and goods. The creature must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to survive the process.

  This spell creates an anchored plane of ice or a hemisphere of ice, depending on the version selected. A wall of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed. A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails. Fire can melt a wall of ice, and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects). Suddenly melting a wall of ice creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes.

It covers up to ten 10-foot square areas (so it can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or some other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.
  \par Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness, or 36 hit points total. Creatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 \add 1 per inch of thickness remaining.
  \par Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes damage (no save).
  \par \subspell{Hemisphere} The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 10 feet. The hemisphere is as hard to break through as the ice plane form, but it does not deal damage to those who go through a breach.

\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell forms a wall of stone atop existing rock surfaces. A wall of stone is 4 inches thick and composed of up to ten 5-foot squares. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
  \par Unlike a wall of iron, you can create a wall of stone in almost any shape you desire. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell's area by half. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area.
  \par Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 15 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 8. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 \add 2 per inch of thickness.
  \par It is possible to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures. Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves.

\spelleff{Wall of thorny brush, up to ten 10 ft. cubes (S)}
\spelldur{\durlong (D)}
\spellsave{None}
\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell creates a barrier of very tough, pliable, tangled brush bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a human's finger. Any creature forced into or attempting to move through a wall of thorns takes slashing damage per square of movement equal to 25 minus the creature's flat-footed AC. (Creatures with a flat-footed Armor Class of 25 or higher, take no damage from contact with the wall.)
  \par You can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall as twenty 10\mult10\mult5 foot blocks. This has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier.
  \par Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a combat maneuver attack or Escape Artist check as a full-round action. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 20, up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land speed. Of course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as described above. A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage.
  \par If you have at least 5 feet of thorns between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of thorns between you, it provides total cover.
  \par Any creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and is caught inside. In order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free, or it can wait until the spell ends. Creatures with the ability to pass throughs overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a wall of thorns at normal speed without taking damage.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  A \spell{wall of thorn} can be breached by slow work with edged weapons or fire. It has hardness 8 and 30 hit points per square foot of thickness.
  \par Despite its appearance, a \spell{wall of thorns} is not actually a living plant, and thus is unaffected by spells that affect plants.

\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  You cause wood to bend and warp, permanently destroying its straightness, form, and strength. A warped door springs open (or becomes stuck, requiring a Strength check to open, at your option). A boat or ship springs a leak. Warped ranged weapons are useless. A warped melee weapon imposes a \minus4 penalty on attack rolls.
  \par You may warp one Small or smaller object or its equivalent per caster level. A Medium object counts as two Small objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as sixteen, and a Colossal object as thirty-two.
  \par Alternatively, you can unwarp wood (effectively warping it back to normal) with this spell, straightening wood that has been warped by this spell or by other means. \spellindirect{make whole}{Make whole}, on the other hand, does no good in repairing a warped item.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  You can combine multiple consecutive \spell{warp wood} spells to warp (or unwarp) an object that is too large for you to warp with a single spell. Until the object is completely warped, it suffers no ill effects.

  The transmuted creatures can tread on any liquid as if it were firm ground. Mud, oil, snow, quicksand, running water, ice, and even lava can be traversed easily, since the subjects' feet hover an inch or two above the surface. (Creatures crossing molten lava still take damage from the heat because they are near it.) The subjects can walk, run, charge, or otherwise move across the surface as if it were normal ground.
  \par If the spell is cast underwater (or while the subjects are partially or wholly submerged in whatever liquid they are in), the subjects are borne toward the surface at 60 feet per round until they can stand on it.

\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
  Each creature in the spell's area are entangled unless it makes a successful Reflex save. This save must be repeated each round that the creature moves or fights within the area. An entangled creature can spend a standard action to make a grapple attack or Escape Artist attempt against the spell's save DC to break the webs holding it, preventing it from being entangled. A creature entangled by the spell remains entangled until it breaks the webs holding it or escapes the spell's area.
  \par If the strands can be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed structures, such as walls, the strands are much more sturdy. A creature entangled within a sturdy web is unable to move from its square until it stops being entangled.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  An entangled creature moves at half speed, cannot run or charge, and takes a \minus2 penalty to attack rolls, Strength and Dexterity-based checks, and armor class. If it attempts to cast a spell must make a Concentration check (DC 10 \add double the spell's level) or lose the spell.
  The strands are too widely spaced to significantly obscure sight, but are flammable. A magic flaming sword can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire can set the webs alight and burn away 5 square feet in 1 round. All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames.
  \spell{Web} can be made permanent with a \spell{permanency} ritual. A permanent \spell{web} that is destroyed regrows in 10 minutes.

\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell is the mightiest spell a wizard or sorcerer can cast. By simply speaking your desires aloud, you can alter reality to better suit you.
  \par Even wish, however, has its limits.
  \par A wish can produce any one of the following effects.
  \begin{itemize*}
    \item Duplicate any general wizard or sorcerer spell of 8th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.
    \item Duplicate any general wizard or sorcerer spell of 7th level or lower even if it's of a prohibited school.
    \item Duplicate any other spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.
    \item Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower even if it's of a prohibited school. 
    \item Undo the harmful effects of many other spells, such as geas/quest or insanity.
    \item Create a nonmagical item of up to 25,000 gp in value.
    \item Create a magic item, or add to the powers of an existing magic item.
    \item Grant a creature a \plus1 inherent bonus to an attribute. Two to five wish spells cast in immediate succession can grant a creature a \plus2 to \plus5 inherent bonus to an attribute (two wishes for a \plus2 inherent bonus, three for a \plus3 inherent bonus, and so on). Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be dispelled. Note: An inherent bonus may not exceed \plus5 for a single attribute, and inherent bonuses to a particular attribute do not stack, so only the best one applies.
    \item Remove injuries and afflictions. A single wish can aid one creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction. For example, you could heal all the damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same wish. A wish can never restore the experience point loss from casting a spell or the level or Constitution loss from being raised from the dead.
    \item Revive the dead. A wish can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a resurrection spell. A wish can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two wishes, one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again. A wish cannot prevent a character who was brought back to life from losing an experience level.
    \item Transport travelers. A wish can lift one creature per caster level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.
    \item Undo misfortune. A wish can undo a single recent event. The wish forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's successful critical hit (either the attack roll or the critical roll), a friend's failed save, and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.
  \end{itemize*}
  \par When casting a wish, you do not specify the exact spell or effect you wish to duplicate. Instead, you make a wish, describing what you want to have happen, and make a DC 20 Wisdom check. If the check fails, your intent is redirected or perverted in some way. For example, a wish to turn a foe to stone would normally mimic the flesh to stone effect of the transmute flesh and stone spell. However, if the Wisdom check failed, your foe might gain the benefit of a stoneskin spell instead.
  \par You may try to use a wish to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. The DC of the Wisdom check increases to 25, and the negative consequences for failing the check increase in proportion to the potency of the effect you try to create.
\end{spelleffect}

  Duplicated spells allow saves and spell resistance as normal.
