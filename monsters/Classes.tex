\chapter{Templates}\label{Templates}

Unlike player characters, monsters do not have ``classes''.
Instead, monsters have templates that grant them specific powers and abilities.
A template grants a monster specific powers and abilities.
All monsters have at least one template, and many have multiple.

All templates provide a \glossterm{challenge rating} adjustment.
Before applying CR adjustments, the monster is considered to have a CR of 0.
