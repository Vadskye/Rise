\chapter{Items and Equipment}

This chapter defines the items and equipment that exist in the universe of Rise, including both magical and nonmagical items.

\section{Wealth and Item Ranks}\label{Wealth}\label{Wealth and Item Ranks}

  The worth of an item can be measured with money, or with the more abstract concept of an item's rank.
  Both measurements are closely connected.
  In general, gold pieces are a more useful concept at low levels, and item rank are more useful at high levels.
  However, both concepts function at any level, so you can use whichever makes more sense in a particular game.

  \subsection{Coins}
    The most common coin is the gold piece (gp). A gold piece is worth 10 silver pieces. Each silver piece is worth 10 copper pieces (cp).
    In addition to copper, silver, and gold coins, there are also platinum pieces (pp), which are each worth 10 gp.

    The standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce (fifty to the pound).

    \begin{dtable}
      \lcaption{Coin Exchange Values}
      \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{l c *{4}{>{\ccol}X}}
        &   & \tb{CP} & \tb{SP} & \tb{GP} & \tb{PP} \tableheaderrule
        Copper piece (cp)   & = & 1       & 1/10    & 1/100   & 1/1,000 \\
        Silver piece (sp)   & = & 10      & 1       & 1/10    & 1/100   \\
        Gold piece (gp)     & = & 100     & 10      & 1       & 1/10    \\
        Platinum piece (pp) & = & 1,000   & 100     & 10      & 1
      \end{dtabularx}
    \end{dtable}

  \subsection{Item Ranks}\label{Item Ranks}

    Each item has a rank associated with it.
    An item's rank is generally correlated with the item's effectiveness, rarity, and value.
    A magic item's \glossterm{power} is equal to twice its rank.
    These effects are summarized in \trefnp{Item Ranks}.
    In general, five items of a given rank are worth the same as a single item that is one rank higher.

    \parhead{Permanent Items and Consumables}
    Long-term items that are expected to be worn or otherwise used repeatedly are more expensive than items that are destroyed immediately after being used.
    Although consumable items are cheaper, they still use their full rank for all other purposes, such as their power and how difficult they are to buy.
    In general, five consumable items of a given rank are worth as much as a single non-consumable item of that rank.

    \begin{columntable}
      \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{l l X X}
        \tb{Rank} & \tb{Power} & \tb{Typical Permanent Item Price} & \tb{Typical Consumable Price} \tableheaderrule
        0         & 0          & 10 gp or less                     & 2 gp or less \\
        1         & 2          & 40 gp                             & 10 gp        \\
        2         & 4          & 200 gp                            & 40 gp        \\
        3         & 6          & 1,000 gp                          & 200 gp       \\
        4         & 8          & 5,000 gp                          & 1,000 gp     \\
        5         & 10         & 25,000 gp                         & 5,000 gp     \\
        6         & 12         & 125,000 gp                        & 25,000 gp    \\
        7         & 14         & 625,000 gp                        & 125,000 gp   \\
      \end{dtabularx}
    \end{columntable}

    Items with a rank of 0 or 1 may be found among common folk, though few commoners would have more than one magic item of any value.
    Items with a rank of 2 or higher are usually only owned or used by nobility, wealthy merchants, and adventurers.

  \subsection{Buying and Selling Items}
    Items of any rank can be exchanged for other items based on their rank.
    In general, items with an rank of 3 or less can be bought or sold in exchange for gold pieces.
    Items with an rank of 4 or higher are exceptionally rare.
    The monetary value of such items is so exorbitant that they are almost never purchased or sold with gold pieces.
    Instead, they are typically exchanged for similarly rare magic items or gems.

    Wandering adventurers typically have a limited time frame to sell their items.
    It can be difficult to find a buyer for valuable items on short notice, so they must accept lower prices than merchants can charge.
    When selling for gold pieces, you can expect to receive a fifth of the item's typical value according to its rank.
    When selling for another item, you can expect to receive an item or trade good of one rank lower in exchange.
    These ratios can be negotiated, and favorably disposed merchants or nobles may give better deals.

    \subsubsection{Trade Goods}
      Some items are considered trade goods.
      Trade goods have a widely agreed upon value, but no intrinsic use.
      Gold pieces and gems are examples of trade goods.
      Trade goods differ from other items in that even adventurers can typically receive their full value when selling them to established merchants.
      Some common trade goods are detailed in \tref{Trade Goods}.

      \begin{dtable}
        \lcaption{Trade Goods}
        \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{l >{\lcol}X}
          \tb{Cost} & \tb{Item} \tableheaderrule
          1 cp & One pound of wheat \\
          2 cp & One pound of flour \\
          1 sp & One pound of iron, or one chicken \\
          5 sp & One pound of tobacco or copper \\
          1 gp & One pound of cinnamon, or one goat \\
          2 gp & One pound of ginger or pepper, or one sheep \\
          3 gp & One pig \\
          4 gp & One square yard of linen \\
          5 gp & One pound of salt or silver \\
          10 gp & One square yard of silk, or one cow \\
          15 gp & One pound of saffron or cloves, or one ox \\
          50 gp & One pound of gold \\
          500 gp & One pound of platinum
        \end{dtabularx}
      \end{dtable}

  \subsection{Typical Wealth Acquisition}
    A typical character finds one non-consumable item appropriate for them per level.
    That item would have a rank equal to that character's highest rank at the time.
    For example, a typical 5th level character would have five items: two rank 2 items, and 3 rank 1 items.
    In addition, characters typically find several consumable items per level that are appropriate to their rank.

    Over time, lower rank items stop being useful, so most characters use no more than five or six different items at a time, plus various consumables.
    A typical 20th level character does not carry around 20 different items.
    However, the lower level items are essentially irrelevant from the perspective of calculating wealth, so the ``one item per level'' guideline is still useful.

    This is a drastic simplification of the sometimes messy process of accumulating wealth and magic items over the course of a typical campaign.
    Characters will often find additional items that they have no immediate use for.
    Players may go several sessions without acquiring any particular items until they complete their current quest, which may reward them with a large number of items at once.
    This is all fine, and the GM should not feel compelled to keep item acquisition perfectly on rails.
    Rise is only loosely balanced around this general pace of item acquisition, and it is not hard - or always necessary - to adjust encounters to deal with unusually wealthy or poor characters.

\section{Using Items}

  \subsection{Manipulating Objects}\label{Manipulating Objects}
    There are two ways to determine how difficult an object is to interact with: its weight, and how it is contained.
    Use the slowest action type from among the both methods.
    You can only manipulate objects as a free action once per round.
    However, you can use a minor action or a standard action in place of a free action for this purpose, allowing you to manipulate up to three objects per round.

    These object manipulation rules are intended to cover interactions that take some amount of time and effort, such as drawing a weapon or opening a door.
    Simply dropping an object in your hands is so trivial that it does not count against your one free action object manipulation per round.
    Other similarly simple interactions may not count against that limit at the GM's discretion.

    Some objects have special rules that indicate how much time they take to interact with, such as \weapontag{Heavy} weapons.
    Those rules override these general guidelines.

    \begin{raggeditemize}
      \itemhead{Containment} If the item is freely accessible, interacting with that item is a \glossterm{free action}.
        Drawing or sheathing an item from a dedicated container for that item, such as a weapon sheath, is normally a \glossterm{minor action}.
        Withdrawing an item from a disorganized heap, such as a bag or backpack, requires a \glossterm{standard action}.
      \itemhead{Weight} If an item's weight category is no heavier than your \glossterm{carrying capacity}, interacting with that item is a \glossterm{free action} (see \pcref{Weight Limits}).
        Pushing or dragging something that exceeds your carrying capacity requires a \glossterm{standard action}.
    \end{raggeditemize}

  \subsection{Moving Items Between Hands}\label{Moving Items Between Hands}
    In general, you can move weapons and similar handheld objects between your hands freely, as long as you are strong enough to hold their combined weight in one hand.
    For example, if you were holding two short swords, you could quickly hold them both in one hand to open a door or cast a spell, and then return to holding one in each hand.
    Likewise, you can reload a longbow without worrying about when you are holding the longbow (and string) with both hands or holding it in one hand while retrieving an arrow from a quiver with the other hand.
    Since shields are more cumbersome to don and remove, this does not allow you to use your shield hand as a free hand in the same way.

  \subsection{Storing Items}\label{Storing Items}
    A character can only store a limited number of weapons in locations that are easy to access in combat.
    Generally, a humanoid creature can carry no more than five ordinary weapons or shields on their body.
    For each additional weapon or similar item stored in a convenient location, you increase your \glossterm{encumbrance} by 1.
    Items carried outside of easy reach in combat, such as in a backpack, are ignored for this purpose.

    A Heavy weapon takes up twice the space of an ordinary weapon, and a Light weapon takes up half that space.
    Compact weapons do not take up a meaningful amount of space, and can be ignored for this purpose.
    Ammunition is typically stored in a quiver or pouch.
    Treat ammunition storage as a separate Light item that can hold an unlimited quantity of any ammunition other than lances.

    For example, you could carry up to ten Light weapons, four normal weapons and a standard shield, or two Heavy weapons plus a normal weapon.

  \subsection{Magic Item Activation}

    Some magic items have to be explicitly activated to have unusual effects.
    For example, the \mitem{seven league boots} can be activated to teleport you across great distances.
    Other magic items constantly have magical effects.
    For example, a \mitem{ring of protection} passively grants you a defense bonus.

    The description of a magic item effect will specify what mechanical actions must be taken, if any, to activate the effects of the item.
    For example, a belt of healing requires a \glossterm{standard action} to activate.
    However, the item description will not specify the exact nature of the action.
    Different items, even if they have the same effect, can have different physical actions that are required to activate the item.
    These activation actions can come in one of the following forms:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Command word: You must speak a specific word that the item will hear and react to.
        For example, you may need to say the word ``healing'' in Elven to activate an item that heals you.
      \item Mental command: You must mentally direct the item to activate, such as by visualizing the item or thinking a particular word.
        % TODO: does this item exist
        For example, you may need to imagine a warm blanket around you to activate an item that protects you from cold damage or environmental effects.
      \item Physical motion: You must perform a specific physical motion, usually involving the item in some way.
        For example, you may need to rapidly stomp one foot on the ground to activate an item that allows you to move faster.
    \end{itemize}

    % TODO: table of random item activations?

  \subsection{Magic Item Limitations}

    There are three restrictions on your ability to use magic items.
    First, you cannot equip two apparel items that take up the same physical location on your body.
    For example, you cannot equip two different gauntlet sets and gain the effects of both, but you could equip several amulets or up to ten rings.

    Second, all magic items require you to attune to them to gain their effect unless they indicate otherwise in their description.
    You can attune to a magic item with the \textit{item attunement} ability, below.

    Third, you cannot attune to two items with the same name, or if one is simply an upgrade of another one.

    \subsubsection{Item Attunement}\label{Item Attunement}

      As a standard action, you can use the \textit{item attunement} ability to attune to items.
      This is a \magical ability.

      \begin{attuneability}{Item Attunement}{\abilitytag{Attune}}
        \abilityusagetime Standard action.
        \rankline
        Choose a magic item you are touching.
        Any abilities the target has that require attunement become active, allowing you to use its full potential.
      \end{attuneability}

      \parhead{Shared Item Attunement} Multiple creatures can attune to the same item simultaneously.
      Since most items only function while worn or wielded, this does not usually allow multiple creatures to gain the benefits of the item.
      However, the creatures can swap the item between them without having to reattune to it each time.

    \subsubsection{Magic Item Power}\label{Magic Item Power}
      The \glossterm{power} of an item is equal to twice its rank.
      An item's power also affects its defenses.
      Its Fortitude and Mental defenses are equal to 5 \add its \glossterm{power}.
      Its Armor defense and Reflex defense are not affected by its \glossterm{power}, and are solely determined by its size and shape.

  \subsection{Removing Magic Items}
    Unless otherwise noted, magic items that have effects on the creature using the item must continue to be worn or held as long as the effect lasts.
    If a magic item has an ability with a duration, removing the item also ends the ability.
    Items which are consumed when used or which do not affect their user are unaffected by this rule.

\newpage
\sectiongraphic*{Weapons}{width=\columnwidth}{equipment/weapons}

  Each weapon has a \glossterm{weapon group} and any number of \glossterm{weapon tags}.
  In addition, each weapon has a particular \glossterm{accuracy} modifier and defines a base \glossterm{dice pool} for attacks using that weapon.
  This section explains each of those concepts and defines the statistics for weapons in Rise.
  You gain a bonus to your \glossterm{weapon damage} equal to half your \glossterm{power} (see \pcref{Weapon Damage}).

  Unless otherwise specified, a weapon must be held in a single \glossterm{free hand}.
  You can use two hands to hold a weapon if you want, but that provides no special benefit unless that weapon has the \weapontag{Versatile Grip} tag (see \pcref{Weapon Tags}).

  \subsection{Weapon Groups}\label{Weapon Groups}
    Weapons are organized into thematically related categories called weapon groups. They are described in \trefnp{Weapon Groups}. For example, all axes belong to the ``axes'' weapon group. Some weapons can be found in multiple weapon groups. For example, a dagger is a simple weapon, a blade, and a thrown weapon.

    \parhead{Exotic Weapons}\nonsectionlabel{Exotic Weapons} Some weapons are rare and have unusual fighting styles.
    These weapons are called exotic weapons.
    Although many characters are proficient with non-exotic weapons, proficiency with exotic weapons is rare.
    Some specific class abilities grant proficiency with exotic weapons.

    \subsubsection{Weapon Proficiency}\label{Weapon Proficiency}
      You take a \minus2 accuracy penalty with weapons you are not proficient with.

    \subsubsection{Improvised Weapons}\label{Improvised Weapons}
      Sometimes objects not crafted to be weapons nonetheless see use in combat.
      In general, treat improvised weapons as being equivalent to the non-exotic manufactured weapon that seems most similar in shape and composition.
      However, since you are not proficient with the improvised weapon, you take a \minus2 accuracy penalty with it.
      If you become proficient with improvised weapons, this accuracy penalty is removed.

    \subsubsection{Natural Weapons}\label{Natural Weapons}
      Natural weapons are weapons that are part of a creature's body instead of being manufactured and wielded.
      Many monsters have natural weapons, like claws or a bite attack.
      Natural weapons do not normally require a \glossterm{free hand} to use.
      All bipedal creatures also have two punch/kick natural weapons.

      Common natural weapons are listed in \tref{Natural Weapons}.
      In addition, some monsters and effects have unique natural weapons, such as the \spell{stonefist} spell.

      \parhead{Physical Size} Like all objects and creatures, weapons have a size category that represents how physically large they are. Most weapons are one size category smaller than their wielder, but \weapontag{Heavy} weapons are the same size category as the wielder.
      All weapons are \glossterm{lightweight} unless otherwise noted.

      \parhead{Inappropriately Sized Weapons}\nonsectionlabel{Inappropriately Sized Weapons} You can use weapons that are sized for creatures that are one size category larger or smaller than you.
      However, you take a \minus2 accuracy penalty on attacks using an inappropriately sized weapon.

  \subsection{Weapon Range Limits}\label{Weapon Range Limits}
    Ranged weapon attacks become less accurate if the target is far away.
    Ranged weapons have two \glossterm{range limits} listed, with a slash between them, such as 90/270.
    The first number indicates the maximum range for a weapon's \glossterm{close range}.
    The second number indicates the maximum range for a weapon's \glossterm{long range}.
    You cannot attack a target that is beyond a weapon's long range limit.

    Attacks at close range have no penalty.
    Attacks at long range have a \minus4 accuracy penalty.
    This is called a \glossterm{longshot penalty}, and some abilities can reduce this penalty.

  \subsection{Weapon Tags}\label{Weapon Tags}
    Some weapons found on \trefnp{Weapons} have tags that indicate that they have special abilities. The list of abilities that weapons can have is given below.
    \weapontagdef{Ammunition} When you hit with a strike using this weapon, it becomes \glossterm{broken}.
    It cannot have magic weapon properties.
    However, whenever you buy or craft this weapon, you receive multiple copies, as indicated in the table below.
    \weapontagdef{Bow} This weapon is a bow used to fire arrows.
    You need both hands to fire a bow.
    Drawing an arrow from a quiver and notching it into a bow requires one \glossterm{free hand} while holding the bow in another hand.
    This is not considered an independent action, so you can fire a bow any number of times per round.
    \weapontagdef{Clinch} You gain a \plus2 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} on \glossterm{melee} \glossterm{strikes} using this weapon against creatures who are \grappled.
    \weapontagdef{Compact} This weapon is unusually small.
    It is one size category smaller than normal (that is, two size categories smaller than the creature it is intended for).
    This makes it easier to conceal (see \pcref{Sleight of Hand}).
    In addition, you only take a \minus5 penalty to Stealth when trying to conceal strikes with a Compact weapon instead of the normal \minus10 or \minus20 penalty for concealing a strike (see \pcref{Stealth}).
    \weapontagdef{Heavy} Heavy weapons are larger and heavier than other weapons.
    You normally need two hands to use a Heavy weapon, whether you are throwing it or using it in melee.
    Drawing a Heavy item from a sheath, or returning it to a sheath, requires a \glossterm{standard action}.

    If you have a Strength of 3 or higher, you draw or sheathe a Heavy item at the same speed as non-Heavy items.
    In addition, you can wield a Heavy weapon in one hand, but you take a \minus1 accuracy penalty with the weapon while doing so.
    This cannot be used if the weapon always requires two hands to fire, such as a titanbow.
    If your Strength is 6 or higher, this accuracy penalty is removed.

    While holding a Heavy weapon in two hands, you gain a \plus1 bonus per 3 \glossterm{power} to your \glossterm{weapon damage} with the weapon.
    This bonus is in addition to the normal bonus that you gain from your power with weapons (see \pcref{Weapon Damage}).
    \weapontagdef{Impact} You get a \glossterm{glancing blow} with this weapon if you would miss by 5 or less (see \pcref{Glancing Blows}).
    This does not allow you to get glancing blows if that would normally be impossible for you, such as if you are making a \glossterm{dual strike}.
    % Assume you have a 70% chance to hit (+0 vs AD 4).
    % +3 accuracy takes you to 1x hit damage per round.
    % +6 accuracy for crits means you crit on 8/9/10.
    % That's a 40% chance for a regular hit, a 20% chance for a glancing blow, and a 30% chance for a crit, so 1.1x hit damage per round.
    % Therefore, +2 accuracy with crits is worth about +1 global accuracy.
    \weapontagdef{Keen} You gain a \plus2 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with \glossterm{strikes} using this weapon for the purpose of determining whether you get a \glossterm{critical hit}.
    \weapontagdef{Light} Light weapons are smaller and easier to handle than other weapons.
    Drawing a Light item from a sheath, or returning it to a sheath, is a \glossterm{free action} rather than a minor action (see \pcref{Manipulating Objects}).
    Attacking with two weapons at once is more accurate with Light weapons (see \pcref{Dual Strikes}).
    \weapontagdef{Long}\label{Long Weapon} This weapon can be used to make melee \glossterm{strikes} against targets up to 10 feet away from you.
    If you use an ability with more specific targets than simply making a melee strike, such as affecting ``all enemies adjacent to you'', this weapon tag does not increase your range with that ability.
    \weapontagdef{Maneuverable} Whenever you use a \atBrawling ability that would normally require a free hand, you can use this weapon instead.
    When you do, you apply any accuracy bonuses that you would normally apply to \glossterm{strikes} with that weapon to the ability.
    The ability is still not a \glossterm{strike}, and this does not cause you to deal damage with the weapon if you hit with that ability.
    \weapontagdef{Massive} This weapon hits everything in a cube-shaped area.
    Attacks with it are not \glossterm{targeted}, so they are not affected by \glossterm{miss chances}.
    Unlike most area attacks, a miss with a Massive weapon does not deal half damage.

    Massive weapons have a measurement that indicates the length of each side of the cube in feet.
    For example, a net is a \abilitytag{Massive} (10) weapon, so it affects everything in a 10 foot wide cube.
    If a weapon has the Massive tag, that replaces any Sweeping tag it would otherwise have.

    Creatures that are Huge or larger automatically gain the Massive tag on all of their weapons.
    For details, see \tref{Size Categories}.
    \weapontagdef{Mounted}\label{Mounted Weapon} If you are mounted, and your mount moves in the same phase that you make a \glossterm{strike} with a Mounted weapon, you gain a \plus2 \glossterm{accuracy} bonus with the strike.
    \weapontagdef{Parrying} If a creature attacks you with a \glossterm{melee} \glossterm{strike} while you wield this weapon, you \glossterm{briefly} gain a \plus2 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with strikes using this weapon against that creature.
    \weapontagdef{Projectile} This weapon fires ammunition at range to deal damage.
    The ammunition generally breaks when used.
    Projectile weapons have two \glossterm{range limits} listed in their description (see \pcref{Weapon Range Limits}).
    They must be reloaded after being fired.
    The time required to reload a projectile weapon is given in the weapon description.
    You take a \minus4 accuracy penalty with Projectile weapons against creatures adjacent to you.
    While riding a moving mount, you take a \minus4 accuracy penalty with Projectile weapons, and your range limits are halved.
    \weapontagdef{Resonating} Whenever you hit and damage a creature with a strike using this weapon, it \glossterm{briefly} takes a -2 penalty to its Armor defense against your attacks.
    \weapontagdef{Subdual} This weapon deals \glossterm{subdual damage} (see \pcref{Subdual Damage}).
    % (30/60) is one improvement, (60/120) is two.
    \weapontagdef{Sweeping}\label{Sweeping} When you make a \glossterm{melee} \glossterm{strike} with this weapon, you may also target one or more secondary creatures or objects adjacent to you.
    If the weapon also has the \weapontag{Long} weapon tag, each secondary target may instead be within 10 feet of you.
    Each secondary target must be within 10 feet of a primary target, and must not already be a target of the strike.
    The strike affects each secondary target in the same way as the primary targets.
    Sweeping weapons have a number that indicates the number of secondary targets you can affect.
    \weapontagdef{Thrown} This weapon is designed to be thrown to deal damage at range.
    Thrown weapons have two \glossterm{range limits} listed in their description (see \pcref{Weapon Range Limits}).
    Unless otherwise noted in a weapon's description, a throwing weapon can be used to attack in melee without penalty.
    % Doesn't cost an improvement slot; very situational
    \weapontagdef{Versatile Grip} This weapon is designed to be held in either one hand or two hands.
    While holding a Versatile Grip weapon in two hands, you gain a \plus1 bonus per 3 \glossterm{power} to your \glossterm{weapon damage} with the weapon, with a minimum bonus of \plus1.
    This bonus is in addition to the normal bonus that you gain from your power with weapons (see \pcref{Weapon Damage}).

  \subsection{Weapon Table}
    Here is the format for weapon entries in the Weapons table, below.

    \parhead{Accuracy} This number modifies your \glossterm{accuracy} with \glossterm{strikes} using the weapon.

    \parhead{Damage} This \glossterm{dice pool} indicates the damage dealt by the weapon on a hit.

    \parhead{Item Rank (Cost)} The first value indicates the \glossterm{item rank} of the item (see \pcref{Item Ranks}).
    The second value in parentheses indicates the average cost to buy the item.
    Items crafted for unusually large or small creatures are more expensive.
    For each size category larger or smaller than Medium, the item's rank increases by one, which increases its price.

    \parhead{Weapon Tags} Some weapons have special properties. See \pcref{Weapon Tags} for details.

    % All weapons should have two improvements over a ``baseline'' +0a/1d6 weapon with no properties.
    % The Light weapon tag comes with an invisible +1a/-1d modifier, so +1a/1d4 with one extra improvement.
    % The Heavy weapon tag does not cost a tag slot and comes with an invisible +1d modifier, so +0a/1d8 with two extra improvements.

  \subsection{Individual Weapon Descriptions}
    Some weapons in \trefnp{Weapons} have additional abilities which are described below.
    \parhead{Arbalest} You draw an arbalest back by turning a small winch. Reloading an arbalest requires two standard actions.
    Each standard action requires one \glossterm{free hand} while holding the arbalest in another hand.
    \parhead{Armblade} This weapon is not held in a hand.
    Instead, it is affixed to the arm of body armor with a medium or heavy \glossterm{usage class}.
    When you attack with an armblade, you cannot use the arm it is attached to for any other combat purpose in the same phase.
    You can use that arm to hold items, but not to maintain a grapple or perform similar actions.
    If you are not proficient with this weapon, you increase your \glossterm{encumbrance} by 2 when wearing armor with an armblade.
    \parhead{Bladed Whip} A bladed whip can be used to attack targets within 15 feet instead of the normal 10 feet for a Long weapon.
    \parhead{Boot Dagger} A boot dagger is a modified boot or boot sole which contains a hidden dagger.
    The dagger is normally concealed, and requires an Awareness check with a \glossterm{difficulty value} of 15 to find.
    Attacking with a boot dagger does not require a \glossterm{free hand}, but you must make a Balance check with a \glossterm{difficulty value} of 10 during whenever you attack with it.
    If you fail this check, you fall \prone after the attack.

    After you attack with a boot dagger, the dagger remains plainly visible.
    Concealing the dagger again requires a standard action.
    \parhead{Claw Sheath} A claw sheath is not a weapon on its own.
    Instead, it wraps around one of your natural weapons.
    This gives no intrinsic benefit, but claw sheaths can be imbued with magic weapon properties that apply to the wrapped natural weapon.
    Claw sheaths are made for claws, but an equivalent can be made for any natural weapon that requires a free hand to use, such as a slam.
    % TODO: split up punch/kick into two natural weapons to make this more intuitive?
    A claw sheath for a punch/kick natural weapon is made for one hand and only affects punches with that hand.
    \parhead{Flatbow} A flatbow is too unwieldy to use while you are mounted.
    Unlike a longbow, a flatbow is flat when not under tension and has approximately rectangular limbs.
    This spreads stress more evenly over the bow's structure, allowing more precise shots, though the firing technique is different and less commonly known.
    A flatbow is the same size category as the creature it is sized for.
    \parhead{Fire Arrows} Attacks with these arrows have the \atFire tag.
    These arrows are treated with alchemist's fire so they can be ignited before being shot.
    The process requires thickening the arrow shaft, reducing the precision of the arrow.
    If you have access to an active flame that is at least as intense as a torch, you can ignite a fire arrow as part of drawing it from a quiver.
    \parhead{Heavy Crossbow} You draw a heavy crossbow back by turning a small winch.
    Loading a heavy crossbow is a standard action that requires one \glossterm{free hand} while holding the crossbow in another hand.
    \parhead{Lance} A lance can only be used effectively while mounted.
    Using a lance on foot imposes a \minus2 accuracy penalty for not being \glossterm{proficient} with the weapon.
    \parhead{Light Crossbow} You draw a light crossbow back by turning a small winch.
    Loading a light crossbow is a \glossterm{minor action} that requires one \glossterm{free hand} while holding the crossbow in another hand.
    \parhead{Lightning Arrows} Attacks with these arrows have the \atElectricity tag.
    These arrows are treated with a reactive alchemical substance so they deal electricity damage on contact.
    The process requires thickening the arrow shaft, reducing the precision of the arrow.
    \parhead{Longbow} A longbow is the same size category as the creature it is sized for.
    \parhead{Net} A net is used to entangle enemies. When you throw a net, you make an attack vs. Reflex against your target. If you hit, the target is \slowed.
    \par A netted creature can escape with a \glossterm{difficulty value} 8 Flexibility check (normally a standard action). The net has 8 hit points and can be burst with a \glossterm{difficulty value} 8 Strength check as a standard action.
    \par A net has no effect on creatures that are Tiny or smaller, or Huge or larger. It must be folded to be thrown effectively, which takes a minute of work. You take a \minus4 accuracy penalty with an unfolded net.
    \parhead{Pellet Crossbow} You need both hands to fire a pellet crossbow.
    You draw a pellet crossbow back by turning a small winch.
    Loading a pellet crossbow is a \glossterm{minor action} that requires one \glossterm{free hand} while holding the crossbow in another hand.
    Unlike most crossbows, a pellet crossbow uses round bullets as ammunition instead of bolts.
    \parhead{Pike} A pike can be used to attack targets within 15 feet instead of the normal 10 feet for a Long weapon.
    However, you cannot use it to attack targets adjacent to you.
    \parhead{Pistol Crossbow} You can draw a pistol crossbow back by hand.
    Loading a pistol crossbow is a \glossterm{minor action} that requires one \glossterm{free hand} while holding the crossbow in another hand.
    You can hold two pistol crossbows in one hand for reloading purposes, and reload them both with a single minor action.
    This makes them easy to make \glossterm{dual strikes} with (see \pcref{Moving Items Between Hands}).
    \parhead{Punch/Kick} All bipedal creatures have access to the punch/kick \glossterm{natural weapon}.
    Normally, this represents a punch, which requires a \glossterm{free hand}.
    If you are trained in the Balance skill, have a Dexterity of at least 3, or are currently flying or gliding, you can make it a kick instead.
    A kick does not require a free hand, but is not otherwise more powerful than a punch.
    \parhead{Recurve Bow} A recurve bow is the same size category as the creature it is sized for.
    \parhead{Repeating Crossbow} The repeating crossbow holds 5 crossbow bolts.
    As long as it holds bolts, you can fire it without reloading, allowing you to use it entirely one-handed.
    Loading a new case of 5 bolts is a \glossterm{standard action} that requires one \glossterm{free hand} while holding the crossbow in another hand.
    \parhead{Shortbow} Unlike most \weapontag{Projectile} weapons, your range limits are not penalized when firing a shortbow while riding a moving mount, and the accuracy penalty is reduced to \minus2 instead of \minus4.
    \parhead{Sling} Loading a sling is a \glossterm{minor action} that requires one \glossterm{free hand} while holding the sling in another hand.
    \par You can hurl ordinary stones with a sling, but stones are not as dense or as round as bullets. You take a \minus1 accuracy penalty with ordinary stones.
    \parhead{Spiked Knee} This weapon is not held in a hand.
    Instead, it is affixed to the leg of body armor with a medium or heavy \glossterm{usage class} (see \pcref{Armor Usage Classes}).
    If you are not proficient with this weapon, you increase your \glossterm{encumbrance} by 2 when wearing armor with a spiked knee.
    \parhead{Takedown Bow} A takedown bow is a bow assembled from multiple independent components that can be reconfigured into two different combinations.
    In its longbow configuration, it functions like a longbow, and in its shortbow configuration, it functions like a shortbow.
    In addition, when it is fully disassembled, it takes up space equivalent to a Compact weapon, making it easier to transport and conceal.
    \parhead{Talon} A talon is always attached to a foot.
    In order to attack with a talon, you must be trained in the Balance skill, have a Dexterity of at least 3, or be currently flying or gliding.
    \parhead{Titanbow} A titanbow is too unwieldy to use while you are mounted.
    It is the same size category as the creature it is sized for.
    \parhead{Torch} Attacks with a torch have the \atFire tag.
    \parhead{Tower Shield} Although you can hold a tower shield in one hand to defend yourself, you need to support it with your other hand to effectively smash it into an enemy.
    That makes it a \weapontag{Heavy} weapon.
    \parhead{War Fan} A war fan grants you a \plus1 bonus to Armor defense while you wield it.
    If you wield two war fans at once, the bonus increases to \plus2.
    This bonus is treated as coming from a shield, and it does not stack with the benefits of using any other shield.
    \parhead{Whip} A whip can be used to attack targets within 15 feet instead of the normal 10 feet for a Long weapon.

  \subsection{Weapon Special Materials}\label{Weapon Special Materials}
    Nonmagical weapons can be made from special materials that can alter the properties of the item.
    These special materials are described in \trefnp{Weapon Special Materials}.
    Depending on the construction of the weapon, it may be entirely composed of the special material, or it may only have its striking surface altered.
    For example, a dragonfang spear may have a wooden haft and still gain the full benefits of being a dragonfang weapon.
    An adamantine club would only have a thin layer of adamantine around the outside, rather than being entirely forged from adamantine, because the weight and cost would otherwise be absurd.

    A weapon that is made from a special material cannot have any magic item properties, and cannot be chosen as a \glossterm{legacy item}.
    \weapontag{Projectile} weapons cannot be made from special materials.
    However, the ammunition fired by Projectile weapons can be made from special materials.
    The benefits of ammunition made from special materials apply even when fired from magical Projectile weapons.

    Any individual weapon can only ever gain the combat benefits of a single special material, even if it contains multiple special materials in its construction.
    That special material is chosen at the time the weapon is crafted and cannot be altered without recrafting it.

    \subsubsection{Weapon Special Material Prices}
      Weapon special materials are listed as having a single rank and price in \trefnp{Armor Special Materials}.
      This is the price for an amount of the special material sufficient to forge a typical weapon, when combined with other normal weaponsmithing materials.

      \parhead{Adamantine} An adamantine weapon deals \plus1d4 \glossterm{weapon damage}.
      In addition, \glossterm{strikes} with it deal double damage to objects that are not made of pure or ordinary adamantine.
      Unlike other weapons, adamantine weapons are not \glossterm{lightweight}, so \abilitytag{Heavy} adamantine weapons typically require a minimum Strength of 2.

\sectiongraphic*{Armor}{width=\columnwidth}{equipment/armor}

  Most characters use armor to protect themselves. There are two kinds of armor: \glossterm{body armor}, such as full plate armor, and \glossterm{shields}.
  Body armor is worn on your body.
  You can only benefit from one body armor at a time.
  If you somehow wear multiple layers of body armor, the penalties stack and the benefits do not stack.
  A shield requires a free hand instead of being worn on the body.

  \subsection{Armor Mechanics}

    \subsubsection{Armor Usage Classes}\label{Armor Usage Classes}
      An armor's \glossterm{usage class} is a measure of how the armor is used, and how much effort is required to use it.
      It indicates whether armor, when used by a creature the armor is sized for, is considered light armor, medium armor, or heavy armor.

    \subsubsection{Armor Proficiency}\label{Armor Proficiency}
      Proficiency with armor is defined by the armor's usage class.
      If you wear or use armor you are not proficient with, it provides half its normal defense bonus.
      In addition, you apply that armor's \glossterm{encumbrance} as a penalty to your \glossterm{accuracy}.
      Since standard shields and padded body armor have no \glossterm{encumbrance}, you can use them without penalizing your attacks.

    \subsubsection{Getting Into And Out Of Armor}
      The time required to don armor depends on its type; see \trefnp{Donning Armor}. Donning and removing body armor and shields takes both hands.
      \parhead{Don} This column tells how long it takes a character to put the armor on. (One minute is 10 rounds.)
      \parhead{Remove} This column tells how long it takes to get the armor off.

      \begin{dtable}
        \lcaption{Donning Armor}
        \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{>{\lcol}X c c}
          \tb{Armor Type}   & \tb{Don}          & \tb{Remove} \tableheaderrule
          Bucklet           & 1 standard action & 1 standard action \\
          Standard shield   & 1 standard action & 1 standard action \\
          Tower shield      & 1 standard action & 1 standard action \\
          Light body armor  & 1 minute          & 1 minute          \\
          Medium body armor & 5 minutes         & 1 minute          \\
          Heavy body armor  & 5 minutes         & 5 minutes         \\
        \end{dtabularx}
      \end{dtable}

    \subsubsection{Weight and Size}
      The size category of body armor is the same as the size category of the creature it is sized for.
      Bucklers and standard shields are one size category smaller than the creature they are sized for, while tower shields are the same size category as the creature they are sized for.
      All armor and shields except for heavy body armor are \glossterm{lightweight} objects.
      In general, heavy body armor weighs so much that only creatures with a Strength of at least 2 can wear it (see \pcref{Weight Limits}).

    \subsubsection{Barding}\label{Barding}
      Armor is normally designed for creatures with two arms and two legs, matching the normal humanoid shape.
      Creatures with more esoteric shapes can wear armor if they are proficient, but it is not as effective.
      This is called barding.

      The Armor defense bonus provided by barding is reduced by 2.
      This penalty also applies to magical effects that mimic armor, such as \ability{mage armor}, if those bonuses do not stack with wearing regular armor.
      Barding must also be custom made for the creature's body type, so unusual creatures cannot simply wear armor designed for humanoid creatures.

  \subsection{Armor Table}
    \par Here is the format for armor entries (given as column headings on \trefnp{Armor and Shields}, below).

    \parhead{Defense} This value indicates how much the armor increases your Armor defense.

    \parhead{Damage Resistance} This value indicates how much the armor increases your \glossterm{damage resistance} (see \pcref{Damage Resistance}).

    \parhead{Vital Rolls} This value indicates how much the armor increases your \glossterm{vital rolls} (see \pcref{Vital Rolls}).

    \parhead{Encumbrance} This value indicates how much the armor increases your \glossterm{encumbrance}.
    You apply your encumbrance as a penalty to all Strength and Dexterity-based checks and skills.
    For details, see \pcref{Encumbrance}.

    \parhead{Speed} This penalty applies to speed with all of your \glossterm{movement modes} while wearing the armor.

    \parhead{Dex Bonus} This multiplier affects the contribution of your Dexterity to your Armor defense.
    It does not change any other effects that Dexterity has.
    If you use multiple armor pieces that modify this bonus, use the lowest value from any single piece rather than multiplying them.
    For example, a creature using brigandine and a standard shield would still add half their Dexterity to their Armor defense.

    \parhead{Item Rank (Cost)} The first value indicates the \glossterm{item rank} of the item (see \pcref{Item Ranks}).
    The second value in parentheses indicates the average cost to buy the item.
    Items crafted for unusually large or small creatures are more expensive.
    For each size category larger than Medium or smaller than Small, the item's rank increases by one, which increases its price.

  \subsection{Individual Armor Descriptions}
    Any special benefits or accessories to the types of armor found on \trefnp{Armor and Shields} are described below.
    \parhead{Buckler} This small metal shield is worn strapped to your forearm.
    At the start of each phase, you choose whether you treat the hand using a buckler as a \glossterm{free hand}.
    If you do, you can wield weapons or otherwise take actions using the arm bearing the buckler, but do not gain the buckler's defensive bonus during that phase.
    \par You can't make \glossterm{strikes} with a buckler.
    \parhead{Full Plate} Each suit of full plate must be individually fitted to its owner by an armorsmith.
    A captured suit can be resized to fit a new owner with a day of work and a \glossterm{difficulty value} 10 Craft (metalworking) check.
    The new owner must still be of the same size category as the size category and general body shape, such as humanoid, that the suit was originally designed for.
    \parhead{Shield, Standard, Wooden or Steel} You strap a shield to your forearm and grip it with your hand.
    A standard shield is so cumbersome that you can't use your shield hand for anything else.
    You can use a standard shield as a weapon (see \tref{Weapons}).
    However, you cannot make \glossterm{dual strikes} with a shield.
    \parhead{Shield, Tower} This massive shield is nearly as tall as an average human.
    When you use the \textit{total defense} ability while wielding a tower shield, you gain a \plus2 bonus to Armor defense in addition to the normal bonuses from taking that action (see \pcref{Total Defense}).
    A tower shield is so cumbersome that you can't use your shield hand for anything else.
    You can use a tower shield as an \glossterm{exotic weapon} (see \tref{Exotic Weapons}).
    However, you cannot make \glossterm{dual strikes} with a shield.

    While wielding a tower shield, you take a \minus1 penalty to \glossterm{accuracy} because of the shield's unwieldy nature.
    \parhead{Shield Spikes} These spikes improve the effectiveness of a standard shield or tower shield when used as a weapon.
    For details, see \tref{Weapons}.
    You can't put spikes on a buckler.
    \parhead{Studded Leather} The studs on studded leather are made of metal, but this amount of metal is not generally enough to make the item count as being made of metal.
    Studded leather armor made with studs from special materials does not grant the wearer the properties of the special material.

  \subsectiongraphic*{Armor Special Materials}{width=\columnwidth}{equipment/armor special materials}
    Nonmagical body armor can be made from special materials that can alter the properties of the item.
    These special materials are described in \trefnp{Armor Special Materials}.

    The benefits of special materials only apply to body armor that is fully made from the given special material.
    If you combine multiple special materials in any way, such as by wearing deepforged leggings with a mithral breastplate, you do not gain any benefits for having special materials.

    Body armor that is made from a special material cannot have any magic item properties, and cannot be chosen as a \glossterm{legacy item}.
    However, you can combine magic items that are not body armor with any set of body armor.
    For example, a set of full plate armor typically comes with gauntlets and heavy boots.
    However, you could wear magic boots and magic gauntlets without sacrificing the benefits of the body armor.

    \subsubsection{Armor Special Material Prices}
      Armor special materials are listed as having a single price in \trefnp{Armor Special Materials}.
      This is the price for an amount of the special material sufficient to forge light or medium armor, when combined with other normal armorsmithing materials.
      Heavy armor requires twice as much of the special material.

      \end{dtable!*}

      \parhead{Adamantine} Adamantine body armor is heavier than other armor.
      Light and medium body armor weighs as much as a normal item of its size category.
      Heavy body armor is a \glossterm{heavyweight} item of its size category.
      For Medium creatures, light and medium adamantine armor requires a minimum Strength of 2 to wear, and heavy adamantine requires a minimum Strength of 5.
      In addition, it provides \mult6 \glossterm{damage resistance} and increases your \glossterm{encumbrance} by 2.

      \parhead{Adamantine, Pure} Pure adamantine body armor is heavier than other armor, as described by adamantine armor.

      However, it makes you \vulnerable to \atFire attacks.

      % Magic armor is a highly limited slot.
      % They have the same power level as self-attune spells.
      \begin{longcolumn}
        \section{Magic Armor}
          \begin{longtablepreface}
            Magic body armor must be worn to gain its effects, while magic shields must be wielded.
            You cannot imbue magic body armor effects on ordinary clothing, even if that clothing is worn on the body instead of armor.

            \subsection{Magic Armor Damage Resistance}\label{Magic Armor Damage Resistance}
              While you are attuned to magical body armor, that armor gains a multiplier to the damage resistance it provides.
              This multiplier does not apply to any special properties the armor might have, such as an enhancement bonus to your damage resistance.
              It only applies to the normal damage resistance normally provided by body armor of that type.
              The magnitude of the multiplier is based on the magic item's rank, as listed below.

              \begin{itemize}
                \item Rank 0--4: \mult1
                \item Rank 3: \mult2
                \item Rank 4: \mult3
                \item Rank 5: \mult4
                \item Rank 6: \mult6
                \item Rank 7: \mult8

            Magic apparel items must be worn to gain their effects.

            \subsection{Body Slots}
              The main limiting factor on how many items you can have equipped is your attunement points, not the physical location of your items on your body.
              However, there are limits to how many items you can wear of the same type, as described below.
              For item types not listed here, use reasonable judgment about what would be plausible.
              \begin{itemize}
                \item Amulet: Up to 2
                \item Belt: Up to 2
                \item Boots: Up to 1
                \item Circlet: Up to 2
                \item Cloak: Up to 2
                \item Gauntlets: Up to 1 (separate from gloves)
                \item Gloves: Up to 1 (separate from gauntlets)
                \item Rings: Up to 5 per hand

  % Magic implements are a highly limited slot.
  % They have the same power level as self-attune spells.
  % This has a lot of text, so we need two columns
\newpage
\sectiongraphic*{Magic Implements}{width=\columnwidth}{equipment/magic implements}

  Like magic weapons, magic implements must be wielded to gain their effects.
  However, while weapons are used to deal damage to enemies, implements are used to grant or enhance magical abilities.

  There are three types of implements: staffs, rods, and wands.
  Staffs improve your existing magical abilities.
  Rods grant new magical abilities, even to those who cannot cast spells.
  Wands grant spellcasters the knowledge of specific spells.

  Staffs are long and thin, with even short staffs measuring no less than four feet long.
  Rods are about three feet long, but sturdily constructed.
  Wands are only about a foot long and very thin.

  \parhead{Somatic Components} While wielding an implement, you may gesture with it to perform \glossterm{somatic components}.
  This means you do not need a separate \glossterm{free hand} to perform those components.

  \parhead{Staff Types}
  There are two types of staffs that you can find.
  Long staffs function like a quarterstaff weapon, but they require two hands to wield, even when used to cast spells.
  Short staffs only require one hand, but they are not suitable for combat.

  \begin{longcolumn}
    \section{Consumables}\label{Consumables}

      \subsection{Potions}
        A potion is a magical liquid that is typically contained in a Fine vial.
        Drinking a potion, or administering a potion to an unconscious creature, requires a standard action.
        Potions cannot be safely mixed together without diluting their magic, so you cannot consume two potions with the same action.

        % \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{equipment/tools goods and mounts}

        The world of Rise has a wide range of minor items like backpacks, blankets, and ten-foot poles.
        In general, the cost of those items is so insignificant from the perspective of an adventuring party that it's not worth the effort to track their cost in detail.
        A subset of particularly expensive items is included in \tref{Permanent Tools, Goods, and Mounts}.

        \subsection{Standard Adventuring Kit}
          % Technically 15.2 gp and 50.5 pounds
          A standard adventuring kit costs 10 gp, weighs 50 pounds, and contains the following items:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Backpack
            \item Bedroll
            \item Flint and steel
            \item Rations, trail (8 days)
