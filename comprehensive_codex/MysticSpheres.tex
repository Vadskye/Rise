\sectiongraphic*{Spell and Ritual Mechanics}{width=\columnwidth}{core mechanics/spell and ritual mechanics}
  Spells and rituals are common types of \magical abilities with some special rules.
  Every spell and ritual belongs to a thematically related grouping called a \glossterm{mystic sphere}.
  To learn a spell or lead a ritual, you must have access to the mystic sphere that it belongs to.

  \subsubsection{Magic Sources}
    There are four \glossterm{magic sources} that characters can use to cast spells and perform rituals: arcane (cast by sorcerers and wizards), divine (cast by clerics and paladins), nature (cast by druids), and pact (cast by votives).
    Each magic source has a set of associated \glossterm{mystic spheres}.

    \parhead{Characters with Multiple Magic Sources}
    Multiclass characters can have access to multiple magic sources.
    Their \glossterm{mystic spheres}, spells, and rituals are tracked separately for each source of magic they have access to.

  \subsection{Casting Components}\label{Casting Components}
    All rituals require both \glossterm{verbal components} and \glossterm{somatic components} (see \pcref{Ability Usage Components}).
    Unless otherwise noted, all spells require \glossterm{verbal components}.
    In addition, spells from the arcane and pact mystic sources require \glossterm{somatic components}.

  \subsectiongraphic*{Rituals}{width=\columnwidth}{core mechanics/rituals}
    Some characters have the ability to lead rituals.
    Individual rituals are not a part of a character's intrinsic knowledge like most abilities are.
    To lead a ritual, you must have a ritual book describing how that ritual is performed, and you must be able to cast a spell of the ritual's rank or higher.
    If at any time a ritual does not have a participating leader, it ends with no effect.

      % The fatigue level cost for 24 hour rituals is equal to (ritual rank ^ 2) * 2.
      % Should this be specified explicitly?
    \subsubsection{Ritual Requirements}\label{Ritual Requirements}
      Every ritual has two requirements to perform it: a casting time, and a number of \glossterm{fatigue levels}.
      Once per minute, the ritual leader can allocate one fatigue level to a creature who participated during that full minute.
      Non-leading ritual participants that are suffering a \glossterm{fatigue penalty} cannot have any additional fatigue levels allocated to them from a ritual.

    \subsubsection{Ritual Participation}
      While a ritual is being performed, creatures can participate in the ritual.
      Participating in a ritual involves spending a standard action each round, which requires both \glossterm{verbal components} and \glossterm{somatic components}.
      Creatures must be able to speak at least one language to participate in a ritual.
      They must also be able to receive instruction about the appropriate actions to take during the ritual.

      Only the ritual leader needs to have a ritual book.
      Non-leading ritual participants must be given instructions by the leader on the steps they should perform during the ritual.
      Creatures can freely start or stop participating in rituals.
      The ritual can even change leaders, as long as it always has at least one ritual leader.

    \subsubsection{Scribing Rituals}
      If you are able to lead rituals, you can scribe the steps to perform a ritual into a ritual book.
      This expends precious magical ink with a value equal to an item of the ritual's rank (see \pcref{Item Ranks}).
      Typically, scribing a ritual requires access to another ritual book containing that ritual.

    \subsubsection{Ritual Mystic Spheres}
      Each ritual belongs to multiple mystic spheres.
      You can only lead rituals from \glossterm{mystic spheres} that you have access to.
      Some rituals have special effects based on which mystic sphere is used to access it.
      If you have access to a ritual through multiple different mystic spheres, you choose which mystic sphere you are using to perform the ritual when the ritual starts.

      % \subsubsection{Attunement Rituals}
      %   Rituals with the \abilitytag{Attune} tag require a single ritual participant to \glossterm{attune} to the ritual's effect.
      %   Any ritual participant can attune to the effect, but only one ritual participant can attune to the effect unless otherwise noted in the ritual's description.
      %   For details, see \pcref{Attuned Abilities}.
