\chapter{Feats}\label{Feats}

A feat grants a character specialized abilities in a specific area.
Feats are optional rules, and not every campaign benefits from including them.
They allow more distinct and unique character customization, but also increase gameplay complexity.

\section{Gaining Feats}
  There are two main ways the GM can use feats in their game.
  Regardless of how you gain feats, you can never gain the same feat twice.

  \parhead{Species Feat Only}
  One simple option is that characters gain a single feat at 1st level based on their species, and no other feats.
  This makes your choice of species more significant without dramatically increasing character complexity.

  \parhead{Feat Progression}
  If the GM wants characters to be more complex and to have more powerful abilities, they can also use a feat progression system.
  For example, you could gain a feat from your species at 1st level, and an additional feat at 3rd, 6th, and 9th level.
  Alternately, you could gain feats based on the completion of major story events.
  In general, it is inadvisable to gain more than four feats total, or to gain feats after about 10th level.

  \subsection{Species Bonus Feats}\label{Species Bonus Feats}
    If you use this rule, each species grants a bonus feat at 1st level.
    Most species can only choose from a small group of feats.
    The specific feats for each species are listed below.
    A character must meet any prerequisites for these bonus feats, as normal.

    \parhead{Human} Any feat.

    \parhead{Dwarf} Any from the following list: \featref*{Battle Armory}, \featref*{Blindfighter}, \featref*{Craft Specialization} and \featref*{Endurance Specialization}, \featref*{Iron Will}, \featref*{Martial Training}, or \featref*{Toughness}.

    \parhead{Elf} Any Casting feat (see \pcref{Casting Feats}), or any from the following list: \featref*{Awareness Specialization} and \featref*{Balance Specialization}, \featref*{Sniper}, or \featref*{Rapid Reaction}.

    \parhead{Gnome} Any Casting feat (see \pcref{Casting Feats}), or any from the following list: \featref*{Blindfighter}, \featref*{Craft Specialization} and \featref*{Stealth Specialization}, \featref*{Telepath}, or \featref*{Toughness}.

    \parhead{Half-Elf} Any Skill feat (see \pcref{Skill Feats}).

    \parhead{Half-Orc} Any Combat feat (see \pcref{Combat Feats}), or any from the following list: \featref*{Endurance Specialization} and \featref*{Intimidate Specialization}, or \featref*{Toughness}.

    \parhead{Halfling} Any from the following list: \featref*{Balance Specialization}, \featref*{Stealth Specialization}, \featref*{Climb Specialization}, \featref*{Iron Will}, or \featref*{Rapid Reaction}.

    \subsubsection{Uncommon Species}
      If you are using uncommon species, the feat lists for each uncommon species are given below.
      Note that uncommon species are normally ineligible for any Ancestry feats.

      \parhead{Animal Hybrid} Any feat strongly associated with the chosen animal. For example, a hybrid shark might choose from Awareness Specialization, Survival Specialization, Swiftrunner, or Swim Specialization. A hybrid wolf might choose from Awareness Specialization, Rapid Reaction, Stealth Specialization, Survival Specialization, or Swiftrunner.

      \parhead{Awakened Animal} Any feat strongly associated with the chosen animal. For example, an awakened cat might choose from Awareness Specialization, Climb Specialization, Flexibility Specialization, Rapid Reaction, Stealth Specialization, or Swiftrunner.

      \parhead{Changeling} Any feat.

      \parhead{Dragon} Iron Will, Toughness, or any Casting feat (see \pcref{Casting Feats}).

      \parhead{Drakkenfel} Draconic Ancestry. The type of dragon chosen for the drakkenfel's \textit{draconic ancestry} must match its \textit{draconic essence}.

      \parhead{Dryaidi} Mental Magic, Regenerator, Sphere Focus: Toxicology, Sphere Focus: Verdamancy, or Toughness.

      \parhead{Eladrin} Boongiver, Chameleon, Deception Specialization and Persuasion Specialization, Maneuver Versatility, or Spellwarped.

      \parhead{Kit} Balance Specialization and Stealth Specialization, Deception Specialization and Social Insight Specialization, or Swiftrunner.

      \parhead{Naiadi} Boongiver, Leadership, Mental Magic, Persuasion Specialization and Swim Specialization, or Sphere Focus: Aquamancy.

      \parhead{Orc} Any Combat feat (see \pcref{Combat Feats}), or any from the following list: \featref*{Endurance Specialization} and \featref*{Intimidate Specialization}, or \featref*{Toughness}.

      \parhead{Oozeborn} Blindfighter, Chameleon, Climb Specialization and Flexibility Specialization, Juggernaut, Regenerator, Sphere Focus: Toxicology, or Toughness.

      \parhead{Tiefling} \featref*{Deception Specialization} and \featref*{Intimidate Specialization}, \featref*{Executioner}, \featref*{Spellwarped}, or \featref*{Sphere Focus: Pyromancy}.

    \subsubsection{Changing Species}
      In extraordinary cases, a creature may change its species.
      For example, the \ritual{reincarnation} ritual returns a creature to life as a different species.
      Regardless of its new species, the creature keeps its original species bonus feat.

\section{Feat Mechanics}

  \subsection{Prerequisites}
    Some feats have prerequisites.
    Unless you meet all of the prerequisites, you cannot take the feat.
    Prerequisites can include a minimum attribute value, another feat or feats, a minimum level of training in a skill, or some other property of a character.
    A character can gain a feat at the same level at which they gain the prerequisite.

    A character who no longer meets all prerequisites for a feat loses all abilities from that feat.

  \subsection{Skill Feats}
    Skill feats are weaker and more narrow in their focus than other feats.
    Whenever a character would choose a single feat, they may instead choose two skill feats.

  \subsection{Feat Tags}
    All feats are organized into different groups by tags.

    \parhead{General} General feats can have a wide variety of effects.
    They often grant new abilities or improve your defenses.

    \parhead{Combat} Combat feats improve your combat capabilities.
    They can increase the damage you deal, grant you new combat abilities, or improve your defenses.

    \parhead{Casting} Casting feats improve your spellcasting abilities.
    Casting feats are useless to characters who cannot cast spells.

    \parhead{Skill} Skill feats improve your skills.
    They can make you more likely to succeed with skill checks and grant you new abilities based on your skills.

    \parhead{Ancestry Feats} Some characters have traces of monstrous blood running in their veins.
    Most of those will never understand the full potential of their unusual heritage.
    Ancestry feats allow characters to explore those posibilities by gaining abilities related to their ancestry.
    You can only have one Ancestry feat.

    \parhead{Magical Feats}
    All abilities granted by feats with the Magical type are \magical in nature.
    Many feats are not entirely magical, but have specific effects that are magical.

    % Feat names must follow ``I have'' or ``I am (a)''.

\section{Feat Descriptions}
  Each feat has a set of benefits it provides to a character with the feat.
  Some feats also have specific requirements that a character must meet before taking the feat.
  These are listed under a \textbf{Prerequisites} heading.
  If a character loses the prerequisites for a feat, they lose all benefits of the feat until they meet the prerequisites again.

  \begin{feat}{Arbalist}{Combat}
    \featpre Dexterity 2, Perception 1.

    \ff[1]{Rapid Reload} Crossbows that would normally take a \glossterm{minor action} for you to reload instead take a non-action, like bows.
    This allows you to reload them any number of times per round.
    You must still have a free hand, if one would normally be required.

    \ff[1]{Steady Bolts} You reduce your \glossterm{longshot penalty} with crossbows by 1.

    \ff[6]{Multiload} Whenever you load a non-repeating crossbow, you can load it with two bolts instead of one.
    When you fire a multiloaded crossbow, you take a \minus1 accuracy penalty, but the strike has an additional \glossterm{secondary target} within 15 feet of the primary target.
    That extra target cannot already be a target of the strike.

    \ff[12]{Rapid Reload\plus} Once per round, you can reload a crossbow that would normally require a standard action to reload as a \glossterm{free action}.
    When you do, you increase your \glossterm{fatigue level} by one.
    You can combine this with reloading the same crossbow as a standard action if the crossbow would need multiple standard actions to reload.

    \ff[12]{Steady Bolts\plus} The penalty reduction increases to 2.

    \ff[18]{Multiload\plus} The number of secondary targets increases to two, and the maximum distance between the primary target and each secondary target increases to 30 feet.
  \end{feat}

  \begin{feat}{Ascetic}{General}
    \featpre Willpower 1.

    \magicalff[1]{Ascetic Archetype} Choose one archetype from your \glossterm{base class} that you do not already have any
    ranks in.
    You are rank 1 in that archetype, and gain the appropriate abilities.
    Your rank in that archetype increases by 1 at 6th level, and every 3 levels thereafter.

    \ff[1]{Deny Wealth} You cannot knowingly own, consume, or use any item or collection of items that is worth more than 1gp.
    If you do, you lose all benefits of this feat, and you suffer a \minus2 penalty to all attacks, checks, and defenses.
    These penalties last until you spend a month following this restriction again.
    If you break this prohibition under duress, including magical compulsion, these penalties only last for three days.

    Any item you craft yourself is exempt from this limitation, as long as the raw materials used to create the item have a value less than 1gp.
    You are allowed to carry valuable items as long as you gain no direct benefit from them, so you can hold items for your allies or carry gold until you can find an appropriate place to donate it.
    You can also interact with expensive structures that you do not own, such as ornate doors.

    \magicalff[1]{Sanctified Garb} Any clothing you wear provides a \plus3 bonus to your Armor defense and a bonus to your maximum \glossterm{damage resistance} equal to your level.
    You can still wear body armor on top of your clothing.
    However, this bonus is considered to come from body armor, so you use the higher Armor defense value and damage resistance bonus from your clothing and your armor.

    You can \glossterm{attune} any number of times to your sanctified garb.
    Each attunement doubles the damage resistance it provides.
    For example, if you attune to it twice, it would provide damage resistance equal to three times your level.

    \ff[6]{Open Mind} You gain an additional \glossterm{insight point}.

    \magicalff[6]{Renounce Legacy} You do not choose a legacy item, and you do not gain any legacy item upgrades (see \pcref{Legacy Items}).
    Instead, you gain a \plus1 bonus to all \glossterm{defenses}.

    \magicalff[12]{Renounce Legacy\plus} The defense bonus increases to \plus2.

    \magicalff[12]{Sanctified Garb\plus} The Armor defense bonus increases to \plus4.

    \ff[18]{Open Mind\plus} You gain two additional insight points.

    \magicalff[18]{Renounce Legacy\plus\plus} The defense bonus increases to \plus3.
  \end{feat}

  \begin{feat}{Awareness Specialization}{Skill}
    \featpre Awareness as a trained skill.

    \ff[1]{Specialization} You gain a \plus3 bonus to the Awareness skill.

    \ff[6]{Extraordinary Senses} You gain one of the following senses: \trait{blindsense} (15 ft.), \trait{darkvision} (60 ft.), \trait{low-light vision}, or \trait{tremorsense} (15 ft.).
    As normal, if you already have the chosen sense from another source, you sum the ranges from both abilities to determine your total range with that sense.

    \ff[12]{Specialization\plus} The bonus from your \textit{specialization} ability increases to \plus5.

    \ff[18]{Extraordinary Senses\plus} You can choose an additional sense from the list given in your \textit{extraordinary senses} ability, except that the range is doubled.
    You cannot choose the same sense that you chose with your \textit{extraordinary senses} ability.
    However, you can also change the sense you chose with that ability.
  \end{feat}

  \begin{feat}{Balance Specialization}{Skill}
    \featpre Balance as a trained skill.

    \ff[1]{Specialization} You gain a \plus3 bonus to the Balance skill.

    \ff[6]{Precise Step} You are unaffected by \glossterm{difficult terrain} from mundane natural sources, such as \glossterm{heavy undergrowth}.

    \ff[12]{Specialization\plus} The bonus from your \textit{specialization} ability increases to \plus5.

    % Modifier at 18: 3 dex + 6 spec + 9 level + 3 train = 21.
    \magicalff[18]{Air Dancer} You can attempt to move on surfaces that cannot support your weight, as described below.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Surfaces that can support at least a quarter of your weight, such as thin tree branches and dense liquids, are \glossterm{difficulty value} 15.
      \item Surfaces that can support at least a tenth of your weight, such as water, are \glossterm{difficulty value} 20.
      \item Surfaces that can support at least a hundredth of your weight, such as tree leaves, are \glossterm{difficulty value} 25.
      \item Surfaces that cannot support your weight at all, such as air, are \glossterm{difficulty value} 30.
    \end{itemize}

    Success means you move along the surface.
    Failure means you fall through the surface, and you cannot use this ability again during the current phase.
    The \glossterm{difficulty value} increases by 5 for each consecutive round that you spend moving in this way.
  \end{feat}

  \begin{magicalfeat}{Barbaric Ancestry}{Ancestry, Magical}
    \featpre Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution sum to at least 3
    \parhead{Special} You can only have one Ancestry feat.

    % Better than Cleave in large group fights where you have time to prebuff, worse otherwise
    \magicalff[1]{Ancestral Battlecry}
    \begin{magicalactiveability}{Ancestral Battlecry}[\atSwift]
      \abilityusagetime Standard action or \glossterm{minor action}.
      \abilitycost One \glossterm{fatigue level} if used as a minor action.
      \rankline
      Three ghostly spirits of your ancestors appear around you.
      They cannot be attacked or interacted with.
      Whenever you make a melee \glossterm{strike}, each spirit mimics you.
      For each spirit that mimics you, the strike can affect an additional secondary target of your choice within 15 foot \glossterm{range} of you, even if you are not adjacent to it.

      At the end of each subsequent round after you use this ability, one of the spirits disappears.
      When all of the spirits have disappeared, this effect ends.
    \end{magicalactiveability}

    \magicalff[6]{Ancestral Totem}
    \begin{magicalsustainability}{Ancestral Totem}{\abilitytag{Manifestation}, \abilitytag{Sustain} (free)}
      \abilityusagetime Standard action or \glossterm{minor action}.
      \abilitycost One \glossterm{fatigue level} if used as a minor action.
      \rankline
      Choose an unoccupied location on solid ground within \longrange of you.
      A Small totem representing your ancestors appears from the ground in that location.
      The totem is a creature that cannot take actions of any kind, including \glossterm{movement}.
      Its \glossterm{hit points} are equal to the standard value for your level and base class.
      Its \glossterm{damage resistance} is equal to half its hit points, ignoring any \glossterm{enhancement bonuses} to hit points.
      Each of its defenses is equal to 5 \add half your level.
      The totem does not block movement for any creatures.
      It cannot be moved without being destroyed.

      While you are within a \largearea radius \glossterm{emanation} from the totem, you gain a \plus2 accuracy bonus with melee strikes.
    \end{magicalsustainability}

    \magicalff[12]{Ancestral Protectors} While you have ghostly spirits active from your \ability{ancestral battlecry} ability, you gain a \plus1 bonus to your Armor defense.
    In addition, you create four spirits when you use that ability rather than three.

    \magicalff[18]{Ancestral Warchief} The range of secondary strikes from your \ability{ancestral battlecry} ability increases to \shortrange.
    In addition, while you are within the emanation of your \ability{ancestral totem}, it counts as an extra spirit for \ability{ancestral battlecry} that does not disappear.
  \end{magicalfeat}

  \begin{feat}{Battle Armory}{Combat}
    \featpre Strength 1, Dexterity 2.

    \ff[1]{Mobile Armory} You can store up to ten items for easy access on your body, rather than five (see \pcref{Storing Items}).

    \ff[1]{Overburdened Quickdraw} Once per round, you can draw or sheathe any non-shield weapon as a \glossterm{free action}.
    This does not count against your normal one free action \glossterm{object manipulation} per round (see \pcref{Manipulating Objects}).

    \magicalff[6]{Legacy Armory} You do not choose an individual weapon as a \glossterm{legacy item} (see \pcref{Legacy Items}).
    Instead, if you choose weapons as your legacy item category, you always treat one weapon you wield as your legacy item.
    You cannot choose a magical weapon or a weapon made of special materials as your legacy item in this way.
    If you wield more than one weapon at a time, you can choose which of your weapons is your legacy item as a \glossterm{free action} once per round.

    \magicalff[6]{Rapid Attunement} You can use the \ability{item attunement} ability to attune to weapons and armor as a \glossterm{minor action} (see \pcref{Item Attunement}).

    This does not prevent your attacks from failing for other reasons.

    \ff[6]{Blindsight} You gain \trait{blindsense} with a 90 foot range, allowing you to sense your surroundings without light (see \pcref{Blindsense}).
    If you already have blindsense, the range of your blindsense increases by 90 feet.
    In addition, you gain \trait{blindsight} with a 30 foot range, allowing you to see without light (see \pcref{Blindsight}).
    If you already have blindsight, the range of your blindsight increases by 30 feet.

    \magicalff[1]{Bloodspell} Whenever you cast a spell, you may use this ability.
    When you do, you gain a \plus1 accuracy bonus with the spell.
    In exchange, you lose two \glossterm{hit points}.
    This hit point loss increases to four hit points at level 7, eight hit points at level 13, and sixteen hit points at level 19.

    % TODO: how do you remove a blood-sworn allegiance? remove curse?
    \magicalff[6]{Blood-Sworn Allegiance} You can swear a blood oath to your allies in a ritual.
    You automatically fail any attack rolls you make against a creature that you have sworn this blood oath with.
    Any missed attacks against those creatures have no effect, even if the attack would normally deal damage on a miss.
    Those creatures have the same effects if they try to attack you.
    This allows you to safely use area spells that include your allies as targets, since they will suffer no ill effect from the attack.

    \magicalff[12]{Bloodbind} Whenever you make a living creature lose \glossterm{hit points} using a spell, you can choose to bind the target's blood to yours.
    As a standard action, you can also forge this bond with any creature that you have sworn \ability{blood-sworn allegiance} with.
    While the target is bound, you are always considered to have \glossterm{line of sight} and \glossterm{line of effect} to it.
    You can see and target it regardless of all forms of \glossterm{concealment} and \glossterm{cover}, even if it is \trait{invisible} or fully behind a solid object.
    You must still be close enough to the target to be within \glossterm{range} with your abilities.
    This binding lasts until you finish a \glossterm{long rest}.

    \magicalff[18]{Bloodspell\plus} You can choose to increase the accuracy bonus to \plus2.

      Choose one \glossterm{ally} within \rngmed range.
      That ally is the target of the spell, and the spell affects that creature as if it were you instead of affecting you.

      If the spell would normally grant you special actions, the target uses its own statistics to determine the results of those actions rather than your statistics.
      For example, it would use its own accuracy and \glossterm{magical power} to attack if you cast the \spell{eyes of flame} spell on it.

      You can only use this ability to affect one spell at a time.
      If you use it again, the original ally's attunement to the old spell ends.
    \end{magicalactiveability}

    \magicalff[6]{Versatile Boon Lore} You learn additional \glossterm{spell}.
    The spell must have the \abilitytag{Attune} tag, but you do not need to have access to the \glossterm{mystic sphere} it is from.
    The mystic sphere it is from must still be part of your \glossterm{magic source}.
    As normal, you can exchange this spell for other spells as you gain access to new spell ranks, but the spell must always have the \abilitytag{Attune} tag.

    \magicalff[12]{Share Boon\plus} You can use your \textit{share boon} ability on up to two spells at once.
    If you use the ability while it already affects another spell, you choose which spells are affected by the ability.

    \magicalff[18]{Sustain Attunement} Whenever you cast an \abilitytag{Attune} spell that is not a \glossterm{deep attunement}, you can choose to replace its \abilitytag{Attune} tag with the \abilitytag{Sustain} (minor) tag.

    In addition, you treat that weapon as having the \weapontag{Light} weapon tag, which allows you to make dual strikes with it more easily (see \pcref{Dual Strikes}).
    This ability does not stack with the ability of the same name from the Perfected Form monk archetype (see \pcref{Perfected Form}).

    \ff[1]{Brawling Expertise} You gain a \plus1 bonus to your \glossterm{brawling accuracy} (see \pcref{Brawling Accuracy}).

        This ability lasts until you \glossterm{dismiss} it or until you use it again.

        A creature that sees an attack against an ally redirected in this way can observe that you are the cause of the redirection with a \glossterm{difficulty value} 5 Awareness check.
        While this ability is active, you cannot be affected by other creatures using this ability on you.
    \end{magicalactiveability}

    \magicalff[6]{Healing Radiance} When you use the \ability{recover} ability, you \glossterm{briefly} emit \glossterm{brilliant illumination} in a \largearea radius \glossterm{zone} from you.
    % TODO: unclear scaling
    At the end of each round, each \glossterm{ally} in the radius of brilliant illumination regains \glossterm{hit points} equal to a quarter of your maximum hit points.

    \magicalff[12]{Angel Wings} You gain feathery wings that sprout from your back.
    These wings grant you a slow \glossterm{fly speed} with a maximum height of 15 feet (see \pcref{Flight}).
    As a \glossterm{free action}, you can increase your \glossterm{fatigue level} by one to ignore this height limit until the end of the round.
    The wings themselves are \glossterm{mundane}, but the ability to fly and glide with them is \magical.

    \magicalff[18]{Angel Wings\plus} The height limit increases to 30 feet.

    \ff[1]{Adaptive Archetype} Choose one archetype that you currently have, and two archetypes you do not have from among any of your classes.
    You cannot choose an archetype that you have which is a prerequisite for another archetype that you have.
    Whenever you finish a \glossterm{short rest}, you can choose which one of those three archetypes you actually have access to.
    You gain all benefits of your chosen archetype, and temporarily lose all benefits from the archetypes you did not choose in this way.

    You must track which choices you made for archetypes that you lose access to in this way, such as which spells and maneuvers you learned.
    When you regain access to that archetype, you must make the same choices.

    \ff[6]{Adaptive Specialty} Whenever you finish a \glossterm{short rest}, you may choose an effect from the list below.
    Each effect lasts until you finish a short rest.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Martial: You become proficient with an additional \glossterm{weapon group} and an additional armor \glossterm{usage class} of your choice.
        You must be proficient with light armor to become proficient with medium armor, and you must be proficient with medium armor to become proficient with heavy armor.
      \item Mystic \sparkle: You gain the ability to use wands as if you were able to cast arcane spells.
        Your maximum spell rank for this purpose is 2.
        This spell rank increases by 1 at 9th level, and every 3 levels thereafter.
      \item Primal: You gain a \plus2 bonus to your \glossterm{fatigue tolerance}.
      \item Skilled: You gain a \plus1 bonus to all skills.
    \end{itemize}

    \ff[12]{Archetype Fusion} Instead of choosing a single archetype to activate with your \textit{adaptive archetype}, you may choose a combination of two archetypes simultaneously.
    First, choose two archetypes to combine from among the three archetypes you chose with your \textit{adaptive archetype} ability.
    For each rank you have access to, you choose one archetype and gain all abilities of that rank from that archetype and no abilities of that rank from the other archetype.
    You cannot choose abilities from an archetype that reference or improve abilities from that same archetype which you do not have.
    For example, you cannot choose the \textit{wildspell\plus} ability unless you also have the \textit{wildspell} ability.

    When you gain this ability, you create one archetype fusion.
    Whenever you increase your rank in the archetype you chose with your \textit{adaptive archetype} ability, you can change this archetype fusion.
    When you finish a short rest, you can choose that fusion, or any of the three normal archetypes you would choose with your \textit{adaptive archetype} ability.

    \ff[18]{Archetype Fusion\plus} You can create an additional archetype fusion that you can change between with your \textit{adaptive archetype} ability.

    \ff[18]{Adaptive Specialty\plus} The effects of your \textit{adaptive specialty} ability improve, as described below.

    \magicalff[6]{Craft Magic Item} You can imbue items with magic using your crafting skill.
    There are two ways to craft magic items: by sacrificing valuable raw materials or by salvaging other magic items.
    If you sacrifice valuable raw materials, you must destroy trade goods or gold pieces as if you were buying an item one rank lower than the item you are crafting  (see \pcref{Item Ranks}).
    If you salvage another magic item, you must either destroy a non-consumable magic item that is at least one rank higher than the item you are crafting, or destroy a non-consumable magic item with the exact same effect as the item you are crafting.
    As normal, you can treat five items of one rank as being equivalent to a single item of one rank higher for either of these crafting methods.

    Crafting a magic item in this way normally requires 24 hours of continuous work which may be split between any number of crafting sessions.
    You can make weaker items more quickly.
    The time required to craft magic items is halved for every rank by which your highest rank exceeds the item's rank, to a minimum of 15 minutes.

    You can also mend a broken magic item if it is one that you could make, or transfer a magical property from one item to a nonmagical item.
    If you transfer an item property in this way, the magic item ability must be valid for the new item.
    If you do so, you treat the item as if it were two ranks lower than its actual rank for the purpose of determining the cost and crafting time, to a minimum rank of 0.
    You cannot mend a \glossterm{destroyed} magic item.

    \ff[12]{Specialization\plus} The bonus from your \textit{specialization} ability increases to \plus5.

    \ff[12]{Specialization\plus} The bonus from your \textit{specialization} ability increases to \plus5.

      You cannot affect anything beyond one mile from you, ignoring \glossterm{line of sight} and \glossterm{line of effect}.
      In addition, all effects of this ability end after ten minutes.
      However, within those limits, you can generally alter reality around you.

      Some examples of lies that would be valid to use with this ability are ``I have a bathtub full of diamonds in the other room'', ``Suddenly, all of the torches in the room were extinguished simultaneously'', and ``Don't worry, my basement cellar has always had an escape tunnel for emergencies''.

      Unlike most \abilitytag{Attune} abilities, you can attune to this ability any number of times, choosing a different spell and projectile each time.
      An individual projectile can only be imbued with this ability once, even if multiple creatures use this ability on the same projectile.

      When you make a \glossterm{strike} with that projectile, the spell takes effect on one primary target of the strike.
      Area spells use the corner of the target's square that is closest to you as their \glossterm{point of origin}.
      If the spell has a direction, such as a cone or line, it faces directly away from you.

      The spell takes effect even if the strike misses.
      Any attack rolls you make for the spell are considered \glossterm{reactive attacks}, and are rolled separately from your attack roll with the strike.

      After the spell takes effect, you \glossterm{briefly} cannot trigger any more spells you imbued this ability, and this ability ends.
      If you fire multiple projectiles imbued with this ability at once, one of the spells takes effect and the others do not.

    In addition, you can ignore all physical obstacles in single one-foot span.
    This can allow you to fire projectiles through creatures or solid walls, though it does not grant you the ability to see through a wall.

    \ff[12]{Disruptive Presence} Whenever an \glossterm{enemy} within an \smallarea radius from you uses a \magical ability as a standard action, the ability has a 20\% chance to fail with no effect.
    If that enemy's maximum rank is less than your maximum rank, this failure chance increases to 50\%.
    This cannot cause passive abilities, triggered abilities, or \glossterm{elite actions} to fail.

      If your suggestion does not seem reasonable, you take a \minus10 accuracy penalty on this attack.
      Exceptionally unreasonable suggestions can impose even greater penalties, and exceptionally reasonable suggestions can give accuracy bonuses.
      Whether you hit or miss, you cannot attack the target with this ability again until it finishes a \glossterm{short rest}.

      \hit As a \glossterm{condition}, the target thinks your suggestion is a good idea and will try to follow it to the best of its abilities.

      In addition, when you choose your action during each phase, you can do so after learning the result of the actions the target took during that phase.
      This includes learning whether its attacks hit, and any obvious effects of those attacks.
      You do not gain any knowledge of actions that have no obvious signs, such as purely mental actions, or actions which you are not observant enough to notice.

    This insight gives you the same information as the insight from your \textit{combat prediction} ability, except that it only provides information about their actions during the movement phase.
    You choose your actions simultaneously with any other creatures who have a similar ability.

    Knowing another creature's action does not automatically allow you to interrupt that action.
    If you want to interrupt an action, such as by blocking a creature's intended movement, you must make an \glossterm{initiative} check as normal.

    The spell can be up to rank 3, even if you do not have access to rank 3 spells.
    When you cast that spell, choose a location within \shortrange of you to act as a \glossterm{targeting proxy}.
    This means the spell determines its targets as if you were in that location, which can allow you to affect targets outside your normal range.

    When you gain access to new spell ranks, you can change which spell you know with this ability, including spells with a higher rank.

    \magicalff[12]{Airborne} You gain a slow \glossterm{fly speed} with a maximum height of 15 feet (see \pcref{Flight}).

    \magicalff[6]{Bubble Spell} You learn an additional spell.
    The spell can be up to rank 3, even if you do not have access to rank 3 spells.
    When you cast that spell, you can imbue it in a Small bubble of water that appears in your space.
    If you do, the spell does not take effect immediately, and you choose a location within \medrange of you.
    The bubble floats 15 feet through the air towards your chosen destination during each subsequent phase.
    It pops when it reaches its destination or hits an intervening obstacle.
    As normal for simultaneous actions, creatures cannot dodge the bubble by moving away in the same phase that it would reach them.

    When the bubble pops, the spell takes effect at the bubble's location as if you were there.
    A targeted spell only targets the creature or object that the bubble popped on.
    Area spells must have their point of origin where the bubble popped, but you can otherwise control their direction normally.
    This affects your \glossterm{line of effect} for the ability, but not your \glossterm{line of sight} (since you still see from your normal location).

    \magicalff[6]{Transposing Spell} You learn an additional \glossterm{targeted} spell.
    The spell can be up to rank 3, even if you do not have access to rank 3 spells.
    When you cast the spell on a Large or smaller creature, you can switch places with the target.
    This requires an attack vs. Mental if the target is not an \glossterm{ally}.
    When you switch places, you \glossterm{teleport} into the target's location, and it teleports into your location.
    If the teleportation is invalid for either target, it fails for both targets.

    When you gain access to new spell ranks, you can change which spell you know with this ability, including spells with a higher rank.

    \magicalff[12]{Efficient Transit} You learn how to transport creatures and objects more smoothly between planes.
    The \glossterm{difficulty value} to hear noise caused by creatures and objects you \glossterm{teleport} increases by 10 (see \pcref{Teleportation Noise}).

    If that second destination is also invalid, the ability fails normally.

    \magicalff[18]{Astral Spell Transit\plus} The range increase from your \textit{astral spell transit} ability increases to \plus30 feet.

    The spell can be up to rank 3, even if you do not have access to rank 3 spells.
    After the spell resolves, each non-\glossterm{ally} targeted by it \glossterm{briefly} takes a \minus1 bonus to all defenses.
    This penalty does not affect any attacks made by the spell itself.
    If the spell did not affect any non-ally creatures, you \glossterm{briefly} gain a \plus1 bonus to all defenses.

    When you gain access to new spell ranks, you can change which spell you know with this ability, including spells with a higher rank.

    \magicalff[12]{Font of Divinity} Choose a spell you know with the \abilitytag{Attune} tag from the \sphere{channel divinity} mystic sphere.
    When you attune to that spell, you may also choose one \glossterm{ally} within \medrange.
    That ally can also choose to attune to the spell, and you both gain its benefits.
    When you stop attuning to that spell, your ally is also forced to stop attuning to the spell.

    Since you cannot attune to the same spell more than once, you cannot share the effects of the spell with more than one ally at a time in this way.
    You can change which spell you choose with this ability whenever you learn a new spell or gain access to a new spell rank.

    \magicalff[18]{Divine Retribution\plus} The bonus also applies against creatures that attack any of your \glossterm{allies}, not just you.

    \glossterm{Mundane} mental actions that would normally take a \glossterm{standard action} instead take a \glossterm{minor action}.
    Long-term activities can be done twice as quickly as normal.
    This includes reading books, searching areas, and other similar activities.
    It does not affect spellcasting, performing rituals, or other similar magical abilities.

    \magicalff[6]{Quickened Chronomancy} You learn an additional spell from the \sphere{Chronomancy} mystic sphere.
    The spell can be up to rank 3, even if you do not have access to rank 3 spells.
    You can cast the spell as a \glossterm{minor action} if you have not already cast a spell that round.

    \magicalff[18]{Accelerated Mind\plus} Once per round, you can perform a purely mental action that would normally require a \glossterm{minor action} as a \glossterm{free action}.
    This can be used to sustain spells or perform other magical feats.
    However, you cannot use the same ability twice in the same round.
    In addition, the speed increase for long-term tasks from your \textit{accelerated mind} ability increases to five times normal speed.

    In addition, the \glossterm{difficulty value} to observe the effects of your \abilitytag{Emotion} abilities with the Awareness and Social Insight skills increases by 10.

    \magicalff[6]{Mind Fragments} When you use a \magical ability that has the \abilitytag{Emotion} tag, you can affect creatures that are immune to that ability due to being \trait{mindless} or \trait{simple-minded}.
    You treat those creatures as being \impervious instead of immune.
    This does not allow you to affect creatures who are immune to those abilities for other reasons.

    \magicalff[12]{Sympathetic Enchantment} You learn an additional \glossterm{targeted} spell from the \sphere{Enchantment} mystic sphere.
    The spell can be up to rank 5, even if you do not have access to rank 5 spells.
    When you cast that spell, you can spend a \glossterm{minor action} to sympathetically link yourself to the spell's targets.
    If you do, you are target of that spell in addition to any other targets.
    In exchange, you \glossterm{reroll} all attack rolls for that spell once, keeping the higher result.

    When you gain access to new spell ranks, you can change which spell you know with this ability, including spells with a higher rank.

    \magicalff[18]{Hidden Influence\plus} The accuracy bonus from your \textit{hidden influence} ability also applies against \partiallyunaware creatures.

    If you do, it lasts as long as you sustain it, and does not remove any previous trinkets you created with that cantrip.

    The spell can be up to rank 3, even if you do not have access to rank 3 spells.
    When you cast the spell, you can spend a \glossterm{minor action} to solidify the spell's light.

    If you do, the edges of any areas of \glossterm{brilliant illumination} created by the spell become physical barriers.
    These barriers provide \glossterm{cover} against attacks made across them, though they cannot be destroyed by damage.
    Moving through the barriers costs an additional ten feet of movement.
    The barriers are only at the edges of the brilliant illumination, so this does not affect movement or attacks entirely within or entirely outside of the illuminated area.

    When you gain access to new spell ranks, you can change which spell you know with this ability, including spells with a higher rank.

    \magicalff[12]{Luminous Precision} You gain a \plus1 accuracy bonus against creatures that are in \glossterm{brilliant illumination}.
    This only applies against creatures that were in brilliant illumination before you used your ability, so simply using an ability that provides brilliant illumination does not grant this bonus.

    \magicalff[18]{Piercing Sight} You can see through solid objects and spell effects up to one inch thick.
    You can perceive the existence of obstacles thinner than that, but they do not inhibit your sight.
    This does not grant you \glossterm{line of effect} to anything you see in this way, since the obstacle still exists.

    When you attack with the spell, compare your attack result to the Fortitude defense of each living target.
    On a hit, that target takes a \minus4 penalty to its other defenses against that spell.

    When you gain access to new spell ranks, you can change which spell you know with this ability, including spells with a higher rank.

    \magicalff[12]{Augmented Body\plus} This loses the \abilitytag{Attune} (deep) tag and gains the \abilitytag{Attune} tag.

    \magicalff[12]{Malleable Flesh} You gain a \plus2 bonus to the Flexibility skill.
    In addition, you gain a \plus2 bonus to your defenses when determining whether a \glossterm{strike} gets a \glossterm{critical hit} against you instead of a normal hit.

    The standard area categories are: \smallarea, \medarea, \largearea, \hugearea, and \gargarea.

    \magicalff[1]{Fire Tolerance} You are \trait{impervious} to \atFire attacks.

    \magicalff[6]{Overheated Pyromancy} You learn an additional spell from the \sphere{Pyromancy} mystic sphere.

    You \glossterm{reroll} all attack rolls for an overheated spell once, keeping the higher result.
    After using this ability, you \glossterm{briefly} cannot use it again and are \vulnerable to \atCold attacks.

    When you gain access to new spell ranks, you can change which spell you know with this ability, including spells with a higher rank.

    \magicalff[6]{Prescient Spell} You learn an additional spell.
    The spell can be up to rank 3, even if you do not have access to rank 3 spells.
    As a \glossterm{minor action}, you can foresee the future of casting that spell.
    When you do, roll 1d10 and record the result.
    If you cast the spell, then the first time you attack with it this round, you must use this die result for the attack roll.
    This does not tell you whether your attack will hit, only high your roll will be.
    A 10 explodes as normal, but only when you actually cast the spell and make the attack, not when foreseeing the future.
    If you don't like the result, you can simply choose not to cast the spell this round, and the die result is ignored.
    Either way, you \glossterm{briefly} cannot use this ability again.

    When you gain access to new spell ranks, you can change which spell you know with this ability, including spells with a higher rank.

      The strike comes from the weapon's location, not your location.

    This can allow you to hold multiple objects simultaneously, though you must still take separate actions to manipulate those objects in any way more complicated than simple movement.
    Alternately, you can hold a single object with two hands instead of one.
    This gives you a \plus1 bonus to your Willpower for the purpose of determining your \glossterm{weight limits}, and allows you to make two-handed attacks with \weapontag{Heavy} and \weapontag{Versatile Grip} weapons using your \ability{telekinetic strike} ability.

    The poison has no effect on you, but your body gains a dose of natural poison.
    This has no effect on injury-based poisons, which affect you normally without being absorbed.

    Whenever a living creature makes you lose \glossterm{hit points} with a \glossterm{melee} strike using a non-Long weapon, you may have that creature become \glossterm{poisoned} by your choice of one of the poisons you store with this ability.
    This expends the dose of that poison.

    \magicalff[12]{Poisonous Blood\plus} You can store up to 6 poison doses with your \textit{poisonous blood} ability.
    In addition, you become immune to all poisons that you do not absorb with that ability.

    \magicalff[18]{Evasive Shade} While you are \glossterm{shadowed}, you take no damage from \glossterm{glancing blows} or misses caused by abilities that affect an area and attack your Armor or Reflex defense.
    This does not protect you from any non-damaging effects of those abilities, or from abilities that affect multiple specific targets without affecting an area.
    If you have the \textit{evasion} monk or rogue ability with the same effect as this ability, you also gain a \plus2 bonus to your Armor and Reflex defenses against area attacks.

    Whenever you cast that spell, plants \glossterm{briefly} grow on the ground where the spell takes effect.
    They appear within the area for area spells, or in all spaces occupied by each target of the spell for targeted spells.
    Bare ground creates \glossterm{light undergrowth}, and existing light undergrowth becomes \glossterm{heavy undergrowth}.
    The plants grow before the spell takes effect, so they can improve the effectiveness of some \sphere{verdamancy} spells.

    When you gain access to new spell ranks, you can change which spell you know with this ability, including spells with a higher rank.

      \abilityusagetime Standard action.
      \rankline
      Make an attack vs. Mental against a creature within half the maximum range of your \glossterm{telepathy}.

      \hit You know the target's current thoughts and emotions.
      In addition to the obvious effects, this grants you a \plus5 bonus to Deception, Persuasion, Intimidate, and Social Insight attacks and checks against the target.
      This bonus does not stack with other effects that allow you access to the target's mind, such as \ability{read emotions}.
      You cannot directly search the target's mind for arbitrary thoughts or information.
      However, creatures often think about questions they are asked, and their thoughts may reveal much more than their words.
      \crit You can also delve through the target's mind to answer a specific question.
      You can pose a question to it mentally and search its mind to know the exact answer to that question.
      This takes five rounds of continuous concentration, and you can only get answers to one such question each time you use this ability.
      The process of searching a creature's mind in this way is no easier to notice than normal for a \abilitytag{Subtle} ability.

      \rankline
      You gain a \plus2 accuracy bonus for every 3 levels beyond 12.
    \end{magicalsustainability}

    \ff[1]{Fortified Body} You gain a \plus2 bonus to your Fortitude defense.
    In addition, you need half the normal amount of rest and sleep each day to function normally.

    \ff[12]{Fortified Body\plus} The defense bonus from your \textit{fortified body} ability increases to \plus4.

    \ff[1]{Alchemical Arrow} As a standard action, you can apply a consumable alchemical item to an arrow.
    The item does not have its normal area or any other immediate effect.
    When you hit or \glossterm{glance} a target with a \glossterm{strike} using that arrow, the alchemical item has its normal effect on that target.
    The alchemical item makes its own attack roll separately from the attack roll for the strike.
    It only affects one target of the strike, even if the strike would normally affect multiple creatures or objects.
    If the alchemical item would normally affect an area, that area is centered on the target of the strike.
    Then, the alchemical item and the arrow are destroyed.

    At the end of the next round after you use this ability, the arrow and alchemical item are destroyed.

    \ff[6]{Combo Expertise} Whenever you use a consumable alchemical item, you \glossterm{briefly} gain a \plus1 accuracy bonus with strikes.
    Whenever you make a strike, you briefly gain a \plus1 accuracy bonus with consumable alchemical items.

    \ff[12]{Alchemical Arrow\plus} When you make a strike with the arrow, the alchemical item takes effect on the target even if the strike misses.
    You can also intentionally miss with the arrow while still delivering the alchemical item to its intended target, allowing you to apply healing potions and similar effects from a distance.
    Finally, the augmented arrow lasts one additional round before being destroyed.

    \ff[18]{Combo Expertise\plus} Both accuracy bonuses increase to \plus2.

      You can only use this ability if you have two \glossterm{free hands} and are not using a magic implement.

      Choose two spells that you know.
      You cast both spells simultaneously, one with each hand.
      This gives the spells \glossterm{somatic components}, regardless of any other effects which would would normally prevent you from requiring somatic components.
      Both spells must affect completely different targets, with no overlap between their targets or areas (if any).
      You cannot use the \ability{desperate exertion} ability to affect either spell.
    \end{magicalactiveability}

    \ff[12]{Twinned Power} You gain a \plus2 bonus to your \glossterm{magical power}.

    Each hand must hold a different weapon, rather than simply holding a heavy weapon in two hands.
    You can use \glossterm{natural weapons} to meet this condition, such as claws, as long as your hand is exclusively dedicated to using the natural weapon and not holding or being used for anything else.
    Several abilities from this feat only function while you are twin-wielding.

    \ff[1]{Twin-Weapon Stance} At the start of each round, you can enter one of the stances below or change which stance you are in.

    \end{itemize}

    \magicalff[6]{Twinned Enhancement} If you are twin-wielding with one \magical weapon and one \glossterm{mundane} weapon that is not made of a special property, you can attune to the magical weapon multiple times.
    For each additional time you attune to the magical weapon, you can copy one of its magical properties that does not require a \glossterm{deep attunement} to your \glossterm{mundane} weapon.
    Normally, weapons can only have one magical property, but this can allow you to copy multiple properties from a \glossterm{legacy item} or \magicitem{composite} weapon.

    \ff[12]{Paired Precision} You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with \glossterm{strikes} using weapons that you are twin-wielding.

    \magicalff[1]{Hardened Barriers} Objects you create using abilities with the \abilitytag{Barrier} \glossterm{ability tag} gain a bonus equal to your \glossterm{power} to their maximum \glossterm{damage resistance}.

    \magicalff[6]{Defensive Barriers} You gain a \plus1 bonus to your Armor defense.
    In addition, objects you create with \abilitytag{Barrier} abilities have minimum defenses equal to 5 \add half your level.

    \magicalff[12]{Barrier Spell} You learn a spell with the \abilitytag{Barrier} ability tag from any \glossterm{mystic sphere} that your \glossterm{magic source} gives access to, even if you do not have access to that mystic sphere.
    When you gain access to new spell ranks, you can change which Barrier spell you know.

    \magicalff[18]{Defensive Barriers\plus} Your Armor defense bonus from your \textit{defensive barriers} ability increases to \plus2.

    \ff[6]{Enhanced Legacy} If you choose your focused weapon as your \glossterm{legacy item}, you can choose an additional magic item property with a maximum rank of 3.
    This does not function if your choice of legacy item is not specific to a particular weapon, such as with the Battle Armory feat.
