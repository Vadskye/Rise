\spellrng{\rngclose}
\spelltgt{One unattended light weapon}
\spelldur{Concentration}
\spellsave{Will negates (object)}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
This spell lets you control the target weapon from a distance. This works exactly like attacking with the weapon normally, except that you use your casting attribute in place of your Strength.
The weapon can travel up to 30 feet in a round before attacking, but if it goes out of the spell's range, you lose control of it and it falls to the ground. The weapon does not provoke attacks of opportunity for moving.
\par You can attack with the weapon in the same round that you cast the spell, and you can continue to control it as long as you concentrate on it (a standard action).
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
Concentrating on the spell to attack with the weapon does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If the weapon is being wielded by a creature, the spell automatically fails.

\end{spellhealthy}

\end{spellblood}
\begin{spellnotes}
A bewildered creature takes a \minus2 penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, checks, DCs, and AC.
\par Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking a confused character. A confused character will not make attacks of opportunity against any creature that it is not already devoted to attacking (either because of its most recent action or because it has just been attacked).
\end{spellnotes}

   A blinded character cannot see. She takes a \minus2 penalty to attack rolls, Armor Class, and any checks which involve sight. In addition, she is flat-footed and moves at half speed.
