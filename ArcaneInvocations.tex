The weapon floats in midair and threatens all squares adjacent to it, and he may make attacks of opportunity with the weapon or with a weapon he wields in his hands, but not both.

You can move the weapon up to 30 feet in any direction, even vertically, as a move action. The weapon does not provoke attacks of opportunity for moving. If the weapon goes outside of the spell's range, you lose control of it and it falls to the ground.
