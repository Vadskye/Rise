          The target is compelled to deliver a message for you.
        You can give the animal a small piece of parchment or similarly sized item containing up to 25 words.
        In addition, choose a destination that you can clearly visualize.
        You must have a general idea of the direction and distance to that location from your current location.
        You must also visualize what a valid recipient for the message looks like.
        You can leave this description vague, such as "any humanoid creature", or be more specific, like "a hawk-nosed human wearing a red cloak".

        The animal will attempt to travel to that destination to the best of its ability, following the directions you have given it.
        It will not willingly part with its message until it reaches its destination.
        Once it reaches its destination, it will wait until it observes a valid recipient, leaving the destination only briefly as necessary to sustain itself.
        When the animal has delivered its message, this effect ends, allowing you to know that the message has been delivered.
