        Choose up to five creatures within \\medrange from among you and your \\glossterm{allies}.
        At the end of each round, the footprints, scent, and other tracks left by each target during that round are magically concealed.
        This increases the \\glossterm{difficulty value} to follow the trail by 10, but does not prevent creatures from seeing or smelling each target normally in combat.
        At the end of each round, if any target is outside of \\longrange from you, the effect is broken for that target and its trail is revealed.
