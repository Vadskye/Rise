    Some spells from this mystic sphere can create a time lock on creatures.
    \\spheredef{time lock} A time lock causes an aspect of a creature to be frozen in time.
    It always locks a specific statistic or status, such as a creature's current \\glossterm{hit points} or location.

    Some effects can unseal the time lock.
    This restores the creature to match the state it was in when the time lock was created.
    For example, the creature's hit points might be restored to their original value.
    Only the specific aspect of the creature sealed by the time lock is changed.
    Everything else about the creature remains the same unless otherwise stated.
    Unsealing a time lock ends the effect.

    If a time locked creature dies, the time lock ends without being unsealed.
