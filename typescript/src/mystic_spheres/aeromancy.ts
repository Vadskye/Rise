        You cannot change the intensity of the weather beyond what would be possible without magic during this time frame.
        For example, you can change a clear sky into a light thunderstorm, but you cannot create a hurricane or tornado from untroubled air.

        You cannot control specific applications of the weather, such as the location of lightning strikes.
