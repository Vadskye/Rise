\cf{Bbn}{Channeled Rage} Some channeled rages require higher levels in barbarian.

\subcf{Mindless Rage} The barbarian becomes immune to mind-affecting spells and effects for the duration of his rage.

\textit{Prerequisites:} Barbarian level 15th.

\subcf{Spellbreaker Rage (Su)} The barbarian gains spell resistance while raging. A creature with spell resistance may always make a saving throw when a spell is cast on it. The saving throw type is indicated by the spell. If it succeeds, the spell has no effect on it.

\textit{Prerequisites:} Barbarian level 9th.

\subcf{Terrifying Rage (Su)} Any enemy beginning its turn within the barbarian's threatened area must make a Will save or be shaken for 5 rounds. The save DC is equal to 10 \add the barbarian's level \add his Charisma modifier. This can only affect any individual creature once per 24 hours.

\textit{Prerequisites:} Barbarian level 6th.

\subcf{Unstoppable Rage} Each round, the barbarian can bull rush an opponent as a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

\textit{Prerequisites:} Barbarian level 6th.

\cf{Bbn}{Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)} At 6th level and higher, a barbarian is always treated as being threatened by two fewer creatures than he actually is for the purpose of determining overwhelm penalties. This defense can deny a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian.
\par If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class and gains improved uncanny dodge, the character stacks those levels to determine if he should gain greater uncanny dodge, and to determine the minimum level a rogue must be to flank the character.

\cf{Bbn}{Larger than Life (Ex)} A barbarian of 7th level or higher holds the strength of a giant in the body of a man (or woman). The barbarian is treated as being one size category larger than he actually is for the purpose of combat maneuvers he performs or is the target of, checks that are affected by size (such as Strength checks to break down doors), and whether a creature's special attacks based on size can affect him if doing so is advantageous to him. In addition, though he uses weapons of the same size, his weapons deal damage as if they were one size category larger, including natural weapons and unarmed strikes. The barbarian's space and reach remain those of a creature of his actual size. The benefits of this class feature stack with the effects of spells and abilities that increase the barbarian's size category.

\cf{Bbn}{Greater Uncanny Dodge (Ex)} At 10th level and higher, a barbarian no longer suffers overwhelm penalties, regardless of the number of foes surrounding him.

\cf{Bbn}{Tireless Rage (Ex)} At 11th level and higher, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his rage.

\cf{Bbn}{Chaotic Rage (Ex)} At 12th level, the barbarian gains the ability to change channeled rage abilities at will, without consuming an additional use of his rage ability. He may not change channeled rages in this way more than once per round.

\cf{Bbn}{Indomitable Will (Ex)} At 13th level, a barbarian becomes immune to compulsion and domination spells and effects.

\cf{Bbn}{Improved Grit (Ex)} At 16th level, a barbarian's fortitude knows no bounds. If he fails a Fortitude save against an effect that deals half damage on a successful save, he takes only half damage.

\cf{Bbn}{Larger than Belief (Ex)} At 17th level, the barbarian's larger than life ability improves. He is treated as being two size categories larger than he actually is.

\cf{Bbn}{Deathless Rage (Ex)} At 19th level and higher, a raging barbarian can scorn death and unconsciousness. As long as his rage continues, he is not staggered at 0 hit points, and cannot take critical damage. However, every 50 points of damage he takes in excess of his hit points reduces the duration of his rage by one round, and the Endless Rage channeled rage ability does not extend the duration of his rage if he is at 0 hit points. Once his rage ends, the effects of the barbarian's wounds apply normally if they have not been healed. This ability does not prevent death from spell effects such as \spell{finger of death} or \spell{disintegrate}.

\cf{Bbn}{Limitless Rage (Ex)} At 20th level, the barbarian may rage at will. He no longer has any limitation on the number of times he can rage each day. He may still rage no more than once per encounter.

If he uses the power, the spell affects all of his allies within an \areamed radius. However, the spell lasts for no longer than half his Charisma score in rounds.
\subcf{Water -- Aquatic Globe} The cleric creates water out of thin air in an immobile \areamed radius emanation from his location for 5 rounds.

\subcf{Trickery -- Exemplar of Deceit} The cleric continuously gains the benefits of the \spell{nondetection} spell, with a caster level equal to his cleric level, except that it also protects him from any spells or effects which would prevent him from lying or reveal his lies. If the effect is dispelled or suppressed, he can resume it as a swift action.
\subcf{War -- Warmaster's Favor} The cleric continuously gains the benefits of the \spell{divine favor} spell, with a caster level equal to his cleric level. If the effect is dispelled or suppressed, he can resume it as a swift action.

As part of the action, he may move up to his movement speed in any direction that water could go. His speed is halved when moving uphill and doubled when moving downhill. He does not provoke attacks of opportunity during this movement, and has physical damage reduction 10 while in this form. At the end of his movement, he regains his normal form.

\par The cleric gains an additional domain mastery at 19th level.
