\cf{Bbn}{Channeled Rage} Some channeled rages require higher levels in barbarian.

\subcf{Mindless Rage} The barbarian becomes immune to mind-affecting spells and effects for the duration of his rage.

\textit{Prerequisites:} Barbarian level 15th.

\subcf{Spellbreaker Rage (Su)} The barbarian gains spell resistance while raging. A creature with spell resistance may always make a saving throw when a spell is cast on it. The saving throw type is indicated by the spell. If it succeeds, the spell has no effect on it.

\textit{Prerequisites:} Barbarian level 9th.

\subcf{Terrifying Rage (Su)} Any enemy beginning its turn within the barbarian's threatened area must make a Will save or be shaken for 5 rounds. The save DC is equal to 10 \add the barbarian's level \add his Charisma modifier. This can only affect any individual creature once per 24 hours.

\textit{Prerequisites:} Barbarian level 6th.

\subcf{Unstoppable Rage} Each round, the barbarian can bull rush an opponent as a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

\textit{Prerequisites:} Barbarian level 6th.

\cf{Bbn}{Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)} At 6th level and higher, a barbarian is always treated as being threatened by two fewer creatures than he actually is for the purpose of determining overwhelm penalties. This defense can deny a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian.
\par If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class and gains improved uncanny dodge, the character stacks those levels to determine if he should gain greater uncanny dodge, and to determine the minimum level a rogue must be to flank the character.

\cf{Bbn}{Larger than Life (Ex)} A barbarian of 7th level or higher holds the strength of a giant in the body of a man (or woman). The barbarian is treated as being one size category larger than he actually is for the purpose of combat maneuvers he performs or is the target of, checks that are affected by size (such as Strength checks to break down doors), and whether a creature's special attacks based on size can affect him if doing so is advantageous to him. In addition, though he uses weapons of the same size, his weapons deal damage as if they were one size category larger, including natural weapons and unarmed strikes. The barbarian's space and reach remain those of a creature of his actual size. The benefits of this class feature stack with the effects of spells and abilities that increase the barbarian's size category.

\cf{Bbn}{Greater Uncanny Dodge (Ex)} At 10th level and higher, a barbarian no longer suffers overwhelm penalties, regardless of the number of foes surrounding him.

\cf{Bbn}{Tireless Rage (Ex)} At 11th level and higher, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his rage.

\cf{Bbn}{Chaotic Rage (Ex)} At 12th level, the barbarian gains the ability to change channeled rage abilities at will, without consuming an additional use of his rage ability. He may not change channeled rages in this way more than once per round.

\cf{Bbn}{Indomitable Will (Ex)} At 13th level, a barbarian becomes immune to compulsion and domination spells and effects.

\cf{Bbn}{Improved Grit (Ex)} At 16th level, a barbarian's fortitude knows no bounds. If he fails a Fortitude save against an effect that deals half damage on a successful save, he takes only half damage.

\cf{Bbn}{Larger than Belief (Ex)} At 17th level, the barbarian's larger than life ability improves. He is treated as being two size categories larger than he actually is.

\cf{Bbn}{Deathless Rage (Ex)} At 19th level and higher, a raging barbarian can scorn death and unconsciousness. As long as his rage continues, he is not staggered at 0 hit points, and cannot take critical damage. However, every 50 points of damage he takes in excess of his hit points reduces the duration of his rage by one round, and the Endless Rage channeled rage ability does not extend the duration of his rage if he is at 0 hit points. Once his rage ends, the effects of the barbarian's wounds apply normally if they have not been healed. This ability does not prevent death from spell effects such as \spell{finger of death} or \spell{disintegrate}.

\cf{Bbn}{Limitless Rage (Ex)} At 20th level, the barbarian may rage at will. He no longer has any limitation on the number of times he can rage each day. He may still rage no more than once per encounter.

If he uses the power, the spell affects all of his allies within an \areamed radius. However, the spell lasts for no longer than half his Charisma score in rounds.
\subcf{Water -- Aquatic Globe} The cleric creates water out of thin air in an immobile \areamed radius emanation from his location for 5 rounds. Everything within the area is treated as if it were underwater. At the end of the duration, the water evaporates, leaving no trace that it was ever there.

\subcf{Earth -- Earth Glide} The cleric gains the earth glide ability, as an earth elemental.

\subcf{Life -- Fountain of Life} The cleric gains fast healing 1. All of the cleric's healing spells and abilities restore critical damage as easily as if it were hit point damage.
\subcf{Magic -- Spellbreaker} The cleric gains spell resistance. A creature with spell resistance may always make a saving throw when a spell is cast on it. The saving throw type is indicated by the spell. If it succeeds, the spell has no effect on it.

\subcf{Trickery -- Exemplar of Deceit} The cleric continuously gains the benefits of the \spell{nondetection} spell, with a caster level equal to his cleric level, except that it also protects him from any spells or effects which would prevent him from lying or reveal his lies. If the effect is dispelled or suppressed, he can resume it as a swift action.
\subcf{War -- Warmaster's Favor} The cleric continuously gains the benefits of the \spell{divine favor} spell, with a caster level equal to his cleric level. If the effect is dispelled or suppressed, he can resume it as a swift action.
\subcf{Water -- Water's Flow} At any time, the cleric can transform into a rushing flow of water as a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. As part of the action, he may move up to his movement speed in any direction that water could go. His speed is halved when moving uphill and doubled when moving downhill. He does not provoke attacks of opportunity during this movement, and has physical damage reduction 10 while in this form. At the end of his movement, he regains his normal form.

\par The cleric gains an additional domain mastery at 19th level.

\cd{Drd}{Wild Speech (Plants) (Ex)} At 6th level, a druid can also converse with plants and plant creatures using her wild speech ability. A regular plant's sense of its surroundings is limited, so it won't be able to give (or recognize) detailed descriptions of creatures or answer questions about events outside its immediate vicinity.

\cf{Drd}{Improved Wild Speech (Su)} At 8th level, anything the druid speaks with with using her wild speech ability must make a Will save to avoid being charmed, as the \spell{charm person} spell, by the druid. The effect lasts for the duration of the conversation, and for 1 hour thereafter. This ability is not mind-affecting, and can affect creatures or even objects of any kind that the druid can converse with. Objects are always considered to fail their Will save.  The druid can choose not to exert this influence.

\cf{Drd}{Improved Natural Casting (Ex)} At 10th level, a druid can cause area spells to originate from up to \rngclose range away from her, as the natural casting ability.

\cf{Drd}{Greater Wild Aspect (Su)} At 11th level, a druid gains the ability to assume aspects of the natural world, including the elements, in addition to those of animals. This ability functions as wild aspect, and assuming a greater wild aspect consumes a use of wild aspect, but the druid may choose from a different list of abilities. Unlike with wild aspects, greater wild aspects must be learned in order within an aspect; a druid cannot gain the air mantle aspect unless she has the endless air aspect. A druid can suppress or resume any greater wild aspect ability as a swift action.

Whenever the druid learns a greater wild aspect, she may choose to learn a wild aspect instead.
\subcf{Air}
\begin{greaterwildaspect}
\wilditem Profusion of Air: The druid constantly exudes good, clean air. She can breathe in any environment, and is immune to \spell{sickening cloud} and similar effects. In addition, she may use her wild speech ability to speak with any natural air.
\wilditem Air Mantle: The druid is surrounded by a mantle of air. Thrown and projectile weapons have a 50\% chance to miss her while this effect is active. Unusually large weapons, such as a giant's boulders, may suffer a decreased miss chance as appropriate to their size.
\wilditemplus Flight: The druid gains a fly speed equal to her land speed, with good maneuverability. She may remain flying for up to 5 rounds at a time. After that, she must land for 1 round before she can fly again.
\end{greaterwildaspect}

\subcf{Earth}
\begin{greaterwildaspect}
\wilditem Earthen Profusion: The druid constantly exudes fresh, solid earth wherever she steps. She gains a \plus4 enhancement bonus to CMD and Fortitude saves against effects that would move her. In addition, she may use her wild speech ability to speak with any natural earth or stone.
\wilditem Earth Mantle: The druid is surrounded by a mantle of earth. She gains a \plus1 enhancement bonus to natural armor class per four druid levels and damage reduction 5/adamantine.
\wilditemplus Earth Glide: The druid gains the earth glide ability, as an earth elemental. She may remain partly within the earth while fighting, granting her cover at no penalty to her own actions.
\end{greaterwildaspect}

\subcf{Fire}
\begin{greaterwildaspect}
\wilditem Flaming Profusion: Wherever the druid moves, she leaves a path of burning flame behind her that lasts until the end of her next turn. A creature who crosses the path takes 1d6 points of fire damage per two druid levels. It can make a Reflex save to halve the damage, with a DC equal to 10 \add the druid's level \add the druid's Charisma. In addition, the druid can her her wild speech ability to speak with any natural fire.
\wilditem Fire Mantle: The druid is surrounded by a mantle of fire. This functions as a warm \spell{fire shield} spell, with a caster level equal to the druid's level.
\wilditemplus Immolation: The druid gains the fire subtype, making her immune to fire but giving her a 50\% vulnerability to cold damage. Whenever she deals fire damage to a creature, she ignites the creature for 5 rounds. An ignited creature takes a \minus2 penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, checks, and AC, and takes d6 damage per round from the fire. If the creature takes a full-round action, it can attempt a Reflex save to put out the fire with a DC of 10 \add the druid's level \add the druid's Charisma. A creature hit by the druid's fire multiple times is not ignited multiple times; only the most recent effect is used.
\end{greaterwildaspect}

\subcf{Plant}
\begin{greaterwildaspect}
\wilditem Profusion of Life: Wherever the druid moves, she leaves a path of small, living plants that entangle foes until the end of her next turn. A creature crossing the path must make a Reflex save with a DC equal to 10 \add the druid's level \add the druid's Charisma or be entangled by the plants and unable to complete the movement. The plants appear on any surface, and will continue to grow if they can survive, though they may die quickly if they appear on inhospitable terrain.
\wilditem Plant Body: The druid's body takes on plantlike characteristics. She gains a \plus1 enhancement bonus to natural armor class per four druid levels and has a 50\% chance to ignore critical hits and sneak attacks.
\wilditemplus Rejuvenation: The druid gains fast healing 5 as long as she remains in sunlight or touches a plant of her size or larger.
\end{greaterwildaspect}

\subcf{Sun}
\begin{greaterwildaspect}
\wilditem Profusion of Light: The druid constantly radiates light in a \arealarge radius. This is treated as true sunlight, not ordinary magical light. Creatures and objects vulnerable to sunlight must make a Fortitude save every round to resist the effect on themselves, with a DC equal to 10 \add the druid's level \add the druid's Charisma.
\wilditem Mantle of Light: The druid glows so brightly that she becomes hard to look at. She gains concealment against all attacks, and any creature attacking her from within the radius of her profusion of light is dazzled for 5 rounds after the attack (no save). She cannot use this ability while suppressing her profusion of light ability, and she cannot use this concealment to hide.
\wilditemplus Piercing Radiance: The druid's illumination radius with her profusion of light ability increases to 100 feet. All visual illusions and shadow effects within the radius are suppressed except those that the druid chooses to allow. Any creature within the radius who attacks the druid is blinded for 1 round after the attack. A successful Fortitude save with a DC of 10 \add the druid's level \add the druid's Charisma prevents the creature from being blinded for the next round.
\end{greaterwildaspect}

\subcf{Water}
\begin{greaterwildaspect}
\wilditem Aqueous Profusion: Wherever the druid moves, she leaves a path of animated water that can grab creatures and cause them to trip. A creature crossing the path must make a Reflex save with a DC equal to 10 \add the druid's level \add the druid's Charisma or fall prone and be unable to complete the movement. In addition, the druid can speak with natural water using her wild speech ability.
\wilditem Watery Mantle: The druid becomes surrounded by an animate mantle of water that reaches out to deflect incoming blows. She gains a \plus10 enhancement bonus to resist grapple attacks and a \plus5 shield bonus.
\wilditemplus Water's Flow: At any time during the duration of this aspect, the druid can transform into a rushing flow of water as a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. As part of the action, she may move up to her movement speed in any direction that water could go. Her speed is halved when moving uphill and doubled when moving downhill. She does not provoke attacks of opportunity during this movement, and has physical damage reduction 10 while in this form. At the end of her movement, she regains her normal form.
\end{greaterwildaspect}

\cf{Drd}{A Thousand Faces (Su)} At 12th level, a druid gains the ability to change
her appearance at will, as if using the \spell{disguise self} spell. This affects the druid's body but not her possessions. It is not an illusory effect, but a minor physical alteration of the druid's appearance, within the limits described for the spell.

\cf{Drd}{Timeless Body (Ex)} After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes attribute score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.

\cf{Drd}{Greater Wild Speech (Ex)} At 16th level, the druid can use her wild speech ability to control creatures' actions. If the druid converses with a creature using her wild speech ability, she may spend a standard action and an additional wild speech use to dominate one creature she is speaking with, as the \spell{dominate person} spell. A successful Will save negates this effect. This ability is not mind-affecting, and can affect creatures of any kind that the druid can converse with.

\cf{Drd}{Totemic Aspect (Su)} At 18th level, the druid can choose any one wild aspect (but not greater aspect). She permanently gains the abilities of that aspect, as if she was constantly manifesting it. She may suppress or resume this effect as a swift action. If the druid has multiple abilites from that aspect, she may suppress or resume them each individually.

\cf{Drd}{Greater Natural Casting (Ex)} At 20th level, a druid may cause area spells to originate from any point within \rngmed range of her, as the natural casting ability.
