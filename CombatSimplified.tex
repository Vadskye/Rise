\chapter{Combat}\label{Combat}

\section{How Combat Works}
Combat takes place in a series of ``rounds'', which represents about six seconds of action. Each round, every character gets a turn to act. The order in which creatures take turns is determined by their initiative (see \pcref{Initiative}). 

When it's your turn, you can take one standard action, one move action, and one swift action. If you want, you can take a full-round action instead of your standard and move actions. You can always ``downgrade'' an action to a lesser action: turning a standard action into a move action, or a move action into a swift action.

\section{Attacks}
As a standard action, you can make an attack roll with a weapon you are wielding, adding your attack modifier to the roll. If your result exceeds your target's Armor Class, your attack hits, and you deal damage.

\subsection{Attack Modifier}
Your attack modifier is equal to the following:

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering Base attack bonus \add attack attribute \add size modifier \add competence bonuses \add enhancement bonus
\end{figure}

Your base attack bonus is determined by your class levels. With medium or heavy weapons, your attack attribute is your Strength. With light weapons and projectile weapons, your attack attribute is your Dexterity. Your size modifier is described on \tref{Size Modifiers}.

\subsection{Reach}
When you wield a normal melee weapon, you can attack anyone within your reach. This is called your ``threatened area''. Typically, that means anyone adjacent to you. Reach for larger and smaller creatures is determined by size, as shown on \trefnp{Size in Combat}.

\subsection{Damage}
When your attack succeeds, you deal damage equal to your weapon's damage die \add half your Strength.

\section{Defenses}

\subsection{Armor Class}
Your Armor Class (AC) represents how hard it is for opponents to land a solid, damaging blow on you. It's the attack roll result that an opponent needs to achieve to hit you. Unlike every other combat statistic, your AC is made up of the sum of other modifiers, each of which can have competence and enhancement bonuses applied separately. Your AC is equal to the following:

{\centering \textbf{10 \add half base attack bonus \add armor modifier \add shield modifier \add Dexterity \add natural armor modifier \add deflection modifier \add dodge modifier \add size modifier}}

\parhead{Base Attack Bonus} Your experience and aptitude in combat affects your ability to defend yourself; experienced warriors know how to recognize and avoid or parry blows that would easily fell novices. As a result, you add half your base attack bonus to your dodge modifier to armor class. This is an inherent bonus, and stacks with all other bonuses to your dodge modifier.
\parhead{Natural Armor Modifier} Natural armor, such as from having unusually tough skin or thick hide, improves your AC. Armor and natural armor do not fully stack; add the higher modifier plus half the lower modifier to your AC. For example, if a warhorse (\plus4 natural armor modifier) wears chainmail barding (\plus6 armor modifier), it gets a total of a \plus8 bonus to AC: the chainmail provides \plus6, and its natural armor is halved to give a \plus2 bonus.
\parhead{Dodge Modifier} Your dodge modifier represents your ability to actively avoid blows. Any situation that denies you your Dexterity bonus also denies you your dodge modifier.
\parhead{Size Modifier} Your size modifier is described on \tref{Size Modifiers}.

\subsubsection{Flat-Footed Armor Class}
Sometimes you can't use your agility to avoid an attack. Your flat-footed armor class is equal to your armor class, ignoring your Dexterity bonus, dodge modifier, and shield modifier. If your Dexterity is negative, you always apply the penalty, even while flat-footed.

\subsubsection{Touch Armor Class}
Sometimes your armor doesn't help you avoid an attack. Your touch armor class is equal to your armor class, ignoring your armor modifier and natural armor modifier. Most touch attacks come from spells.

\subsection{Hit Points}
Your hit points is a defense that represents how much more punishment you can take. When you run out hit points, you can't act anymore, and you might die, as described in \pcref{Injury and Death}.

\subsection{Saving Throws}
Generally, when you are subject to an unusual or magical attack, you get a saving throw to avoid or reduce the effect. You make a saving throw by rolling a d20 and adding your saving throw modifier. If it is greater than the save DC of the attack, you resist the attack (though it may still have partial effects on you). Your saving throw modifier is calculated as follows:

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering Base save bonus \add primary attribute \add 1/2 secondary attribute \add competence bonuses \add enhancement bonus
\end{figure}

Your base save bonus is determined by your class levels.

\subsubsection{Saving Throw Types}
The three different kinds of saving throws are Fortitude, Reflex, and Will.
\parhead{Fortitude} These saves measure your ability to stand up to physical punishment or attacks against your vitality and health. Apply your Constitution and half your Strength to your Fortitude saving throws.
\parhead{Reflex} These saves test your ability to dodge area attacks. Apply your Dexterity and half your Wisdom to your Reflex saving throws.
\parhead{Will} These saves reflect your resistance to mental influence as well as many magical effects. Apply your Charisma and half your Intelligence to your Will saving throws.

\section{Attacks of Opportunity}
Sometimes a combatant in a melee lets her guard down. In this case, combatants near her can take advantage of her lapse in defense to attack her for free. These free attacks are called attacks of opportunity.

\subsection{Provoking Attacks of Opportunity}
\parhead{Leaving an Opening} To defend yourself, you must be actively wielding a weapon or shield you are proficient with. You provoke an attack of opportunity if at any point during your turn you are not wielding a weapon or shield, or you use your hand wielding the weapon or shield for some task other than engaging in combat (such as sheathing your weapon).

\parhead{Leaving the Battle} You provoke an attack of opportunity whenever you move farther away from an opponent who threatens you. This can be mitigated with the withdraw and backpedal movement actions.

\subsection{Taking Attacks of Opportunity}
If a creature within your threatened area provokes an attack of opportunity, you can immediately make a single melee attack against that creature. The attack of opportunity ``interrupts'' anything else the creature was been doing. The creature can continue its turn after your attack of opportunity is resolved.

You can make a number of attacks of opportunity each round equal to 1 \add half your Dexterity, but never more than one per opportunity. You don't have to make an attack of opportunity if you don't want to.

\section{Movement}

\subsection{Ways to Move}

\parhead{Move} As a move action, you can move up to your speed.
\parhead{Stand Up} As a move action, you can stand up from being prone.
\parhead{Backpedal} As a move action, you can move up to half your speed. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity from any creature you attacked during your turn.
\parhead{Charge} As a full-round action, you can move up to twice your speed and make a single attack with a \plus2 circumstance bonus to hit at the end of your charge. While charging, and until the start of your next turn, you take a \minus2 penalty to armor class.
\par You must move at least 30 feet to gain the benefit of a charge, and all movement must be in a single straight line. If there are any obstacles in your path which hinder your movement, you cannot charge. A charge that fails or becomes invalid partway through becomes a hustle action.
\parhead{Hustle} As a full-round action, you can move up to twice your speed.
\parhead{Run} As a full-round action, you can run at full speed. This allows you to move up to quadruple your speed. You move at only triple speed if you are wearing medium or heavy armor. While running, and until the start of your next turn, you are flat-footed against all attacks. 
\parhead{Withdraw} As a full-round action, you can move up to your speed. Before you do so, you can designate one creature who threatens you. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity from that creature.

\section{Initiative}

At the start of a battle, each creature that is aware of the combat makes an initiative check. Your initiative check is calculated as follows:

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering Dexterity \add half Wisdom \add competence bonuses \add enhancement bonus
\end{figure}

Creatures act in order of their initiative, highest to lowest. After the creature with the lowest initiative acts, a new round begins and the creature with the highest initiative acts again. You usually keep your initiative for the whole encounter, even if you can't act. However, some special actions can change your initiative count.

\subsubsection{Surprise Attacks}
Sometimes, some creatures are not aware of the combat when it starts. This most commonly happens with ambushes. Any creature that is not aware of the combat doesn't get to make an initiative check during the first round of combat. Until it takes its first action, it is flat-footed and can't take attacks of opportunity.

Sometimes, everyone is surprised, such as if a guard walks around a corner to unexpectedly find a group of muggers. In that case, initiative is rolled normally, but all creatures are flat-footed and can't take attacks of opportunity until they take their first action.

\section{Circumstances, Bonuses, and Penalties}

\subsection{Size in Combat}
Size affects your space and reach in combat. In addition, your attack modifier and armor class is affected by your size modifier. These effects are shown on \trefnp{Size in Combat}. 

\begin{dtable*}

        Colossal (long) & \minus8 & 30 ft.\plus & 20 ft.\plus & Great wyrm red dragon \\
    \end{tabularx}
    1 Creatures can vary in space and reach. These are simply typical values.
\end{dtable*}

\subsection{Range Increments}
When using a ranged weapon, you take a \minus2 penalty per range increment between you and your target. For example, when using a longbow with a range increment of 100 feet against a target 170 feet away, you take a \minus2 penalty to attack rolls.
