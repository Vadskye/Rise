# Magic Item Design

## Spell Balance

Many effects that items can provide can also be gained from Attune spells.
In general, an item providing a given effect should have an item level 3 levels higher than the
minimum level required to cast the corresponding spell, treating 1st level spells as having a
minimum level of 2.
This ensures that buffs from spellcasters are valuable, and that buff spells are worth taking.

Magic items can also only copy spells that were Attune (target) instead of Attune (self).
Attune (self) spells are often stronger than Attune (target) spells.

### Examples
Deflective Shield is a 1st level spell (min level 2), so Protective Armor is item level 5.

Resist Energy is a 3rd level spell (min level 8), so Armor of Energy Resistance is item level 11.
