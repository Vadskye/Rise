# Magic Item Design

## Spell Balance

Many effects that items can provide can also be gained from Attune (target) spells.
In general, an item providing a given effect should have an item level 3 levels lower than the
minimum level required to cast the corresponding spell.
This matches the minimum level required to gain access to an Attune (self) version of that spell.
This ensures that items are valuable, since only one person can wear an item, but everyone can use
an Attune (target) spell.

Magic items can also only copy spells that were Attune (target) instead of Attune (self).
Attune (self) spells are often stronger, especially narratively, than Attune (target) spells.

### Examples
Deflective Shield becomes able to target allies at rank 4 (min level 8), so
Protective Armor is a level 5 item.

Deflective Shield increases its bonus to +2 at rank 6 (min level 14), so Greater Protective
Armor is a level 11 item.

Deflective Shield increases its bonus to +3 at rank 8 (min level 20), so Supreme Protective
Armor is a level 17 item.

Battle Blessing is a rank 5 spell (min level 11), so a Surestrike weapon is a level 8 item.

Battle Blessing increases its bonus to +2 at rank 7 spell (min level 17), so a Greater Surestrike weapon is a level 14 item.

This suggests that a Supreme Surestrike weapon could exist as a level 20 item, though there is no
corresponding spell.
