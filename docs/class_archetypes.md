# Class Archetype Patterns

Class archetypes follow one of four patterns: Insight Ability, Focus Standard Ability, Focus
Non-Standard Ability, Spells, Statistic Boost

## Insight Ability

An Insight Ability archetype is focused around a single active ability that the character gains.
The ability may be an ability that takes a standard action, or it may be an attuned or "lasts until
used again" ability.
The ability has a number of variants that can be acquired by spending insight points.
Each variant is accessible from level 1 and automatically scales with rank on a 3/5/7 pattern.

### Rank Pattern

1. Insight ability access with one free variant
2. Statistical benefit 1
3. Statistical benefit 2
4. Additional variant of insight ability
5. Greater rank 2 ability
6. Greater rank 3 ability
7. Additional variant of insight ability
8. Unknown

### Examples

Barbarian - Primal Warrior
