# Class Archetype Patterns

## Archtype Pattern: Numeric

### Rank 0: Statistical Hint

Rank 0 abilities should provide a minor statistical bonus that hints at the direction the archetype
will go. Rank 0 abilities should never be complicated, since level 1 characters start with all of
them in addition to a rank 1 ability.

Examples:
* +2 to a skill and +1 to a non-Armor defense
* +2 to a non-Armor defense
* +1 Armor defense
* +2 skill points

### Rank 1: Identity

Rank 1 abilities should be the core of the archetype's identity. For any archetypes, this is where
the fundamental ability is introduced that then receives various upgrades later on (Quarry, Rage,
spellcasting, etc.). Rank 1 abilities can be complicated, but they generally don't rewrite how the
game works for the character passively. Every character should be able to experience the game
"normally" from levels 1-3 before gaining access to any Restructure rank 2 abilities that can change
how the character experiences the game.

### Rank 2: Restructure

Most rank 2 abilities should apply some sort of fundamental change to how the character experiences
or interacts with the universe. 

Examples:

### Rank 3: Statistical Power

Most rank 3 abilities should introduce a new statistical benefit to the character that makes them
better at whatever their archetype is focused in. Unlike a Restructure ability, a Statistical Power
ability shouldn't be particularly complicated or alter a character's mechanics significantly, though
it can be a meaningful power boost.

Examples:
* +half level to power
* +weapon die to damage (shouldn't be in archetypes that already have earlier damage bonuses)

### Rank 5: Greater Restructure

### Rank 6: Greater Statistical Power

Most rank 6 abilities should expand on the statistical benefit provided by the rank 3 ability from
the archetype.

Examples:
* +1 to a relevant base attribute

## Archetype Pattern: Active Abilities

### Rank 1: Identity Ability

### Rank 2: Restructure

### Rank 3: Secondary Ability

### Rank 4: Statistical Power

### Rank 5: Greater Restructure
