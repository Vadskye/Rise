# Magic Equipment Scaling

## Magic weapons

Magic weapons, and equivalently special material weapons, should increase combat potential. But by how much? Rise shouldn't require a strict wealth balancing, so the possible effect of magic items has to be limited.

As a rough guideline, a magic weapon should provide 10% more damage at rank 1 and 40% more damage at rank 7. That still provides some room for scaling, but it's a compressed scaling that doesn't place hard requirements on wealth to function. You will eventually be punished for not using any magic weapon, but by rank 7, it seems reasonable to assume that anyone who cares about martial damage will have a magic weapon or special material weapon. Broken down per rank:

* Rank 1: +15%
* Rank 3: +20% (0.2 EA)
* Rank 5: +25%
* Rank 7: +30% (0.3 EA)

### Special materials

Special materials should generally be 10% behind a standard magic weapon in power, since they don't require attunement to function. In short:

* Rank 3: +10%
* Rank 5: +20%
* Rank 7: +30%

### Extra damage

Justification for these values is in the scaling spreadsheet.

* Rank 1: +1
* Rank 2: +2
* Rank 3: +1d4
* Rank 4: +1d6
* Rank 5: +1d8
* Rank 6: +1d10
* Rank 7: +2d6
* Rank 8: +2d8
* Rank 9: +2d10

Note that this mostly ignores the existence of triple damage maneuvers because that messes up the scaling, so extra damage is unusually good when combined with triple damage maneuvers. On the plus side, this allows us to use the same scaling for maneuvers and spells.

Special materials are two ranks behind.

### Accuracy

Although we generally consider +1 accuracy to be 0.1 EA in the context of active buffs, weapons should treat +1a as 0.2 EA. Accuracy is universally useful, and you can tune your accuracy to be optimal with passive abilities like weapons more easily than you can tune it with buffs.

This is a bit harsh for +2 accuracy though, since each accuracy is only really providing ~15% more damage generally, so:
* +1 accuracy: Rank 3
* +2 accuracy: Rank 7
* +3 accuracy: Rank 11 

### Weapon conditions

Most weapons should have some sort of condition or circumstance associated with their power. The expectation is that you should generally be able to meet the condition without too much effort, but it helps make weapons less generic. A fully unconditional weapon would be 1 rank behind a "normal" weapon power level.
