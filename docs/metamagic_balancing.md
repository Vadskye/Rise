# Metamagic Balancing

## Spell Accuracy

Assume that Precise Spell generally takes you from 70% chance to hit to 90% chance to hit, or about a 30% increase in hit probability.

## Spell Power

The power bonus should be reasonable to take compared to Precise Spell.
That means it has to be somewhere in the range of a 30% damage increase.
It would be reasonable for it to be closer to 25% if it uses extra damage, since that will be a higher percentage bonus to area spells.

From the calculation sheet, 25% of high damage is:
Rank 1: 1.6 (35% of power)
Rank 2: 2.2
Rank 3: 3.2
Rank 4: 4.5 (40% of power)
Rank 5: 6.4 (51% of power)
Rank 6: 9.0 (60% of power)
Rank 7: 12.8 (78% of power)

It seems like "half power" is an acceptably simple scaling factor that stays close enough until approximately rank 7.
