# Damaging Ability Area

Because area size scales strongly with rank, at low ranks, a single-target ability may be more versatile than an area ability. What is the crossover point?

## Damage by ability rank

If it's a damage plus debuff spell, reduce the listed damage rank by 1.

* Rank X:
  * drX in Med range
  * drX in R1 area
  * drX+1 in Short range
  * Debuff rank X+1 in Short range
  * drX+1 in R0 area
  * drX+2 in melee range
* Rank X, where X >= 2:
  * drX-1 in Long range
  * drX-1 in R(X/2) area, to a minimum of R2 area
  * Debuff rank X+1 in R(X/2) area
* Rank X, where X >= 3:
  * drX-2 in Distant range
  * drX-2 in RX area, ignoring extreme areas
* Rank X, where X >= 5:
  * drX-3 in RX area, including extreme areas
