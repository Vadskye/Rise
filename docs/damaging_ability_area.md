# Damaging Ability Area

Because area size scales strongly with rank, at low ranks, a single-target ability may be more versatile than an area ability. What is the crossover point?

## Single target damage by rank

At every rank X, single target damage follows the same pattern:
* drX-2 in Distant range
* drX-1 in Long range
* drX in Medium range
* drX+1 in Short range
* drX+2 in melee range

## Area rank/range equivalency
* A Rank 0 area is equivalent to Short range
* A Rank 1 area is equivalent to Medium range
* A Rank 2 area is equivalent to Long range

## Examples

These are separate from the "default" large area scaling for a rank X spell, which deals drX-1 damage in a rank X area.

* Rank 1:
  * dr2 in a r0 area
  * dr1 in a r1 area

* Rank X:
  * drX+1 in a r0 area
  * drX in a r1 area
