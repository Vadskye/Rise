\chapter{Races}\label{Races}

Each character has a race.

\section{Racial Traits}

\subsection{Racial Bonus Feats}
Each race grants a bonus feat at 1st level. Most races can only choose from a small group of feats, listed in the description of the race. A character must meet any prerequisites for these bonus feats, as normal.

\subsection{Favored Weapons}
The names of some exotic weapons, such as the orcish double axe, include the name of a race. Members of the named race are treated as being proficient with exotic weapons for the purpose of wielding those weapons.

\subsection{Race and Languages}
All characters know how to speak Common. A dwarf, elf, gnome, half-elf, half-orc, or halfling also speaks a racial language, as appropriate. For each point of Intelligence a character has at 1st level, they also know one additional language of their choice. See \pcref{Linguistics}, for details about languages.

\subsection{Small Characters}\label{Small Characters}
A Small character has the following effects based on their size.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \minus4 penalty to Fortitude defense.
    \item \minus4 penalty to maneuver accuracy and defense.
    \item \plus1 bonus to other physical accuracy and defenses.
    \item \plus4 bonus to Stealth checks.
    \item Carrying capacity is three-quarters that of a Medium character (see \pcref{Encumbrance}).
  \end{itemize}

In addition, a Small character generally moves about two-thirds as fast as a Medium character. A Small character must also use smaller weapons than a Medium character.
