\glossdef{attack}[attacks] Anything that affects another creature in a potentially harmful way. There are two kinds of attacks: physical attacks and special attacks.

\glossdef{attack roll}[attack rolls] A roll required to succeed with an attack. If the result of the attack roll equals or exceeds the target's \glossterm{defense}, the attack succeeds. Some attacks, especially magical attacks, have effects even if the attack roll fails.

\glossdef{attribute} A core representation of a character's capacity in a wide range of areas. There are six attributes: \glossterm{Strength}, \glossterm{Dexterity}, \glossterm{Constitution}, \glossterm{Intelligence}, \glossterm{Perception}, and \glossterm{Willpower}.

\glossdef{base bonus} A base bonus is the value of a bonus before any temporary modifiers or effects. For example, your base Fortitude defense bonus is equal to the Fortitude defense bonus granted by your class.

\glossdef{class skill}[class skills] A class skill is a skill which you can train with using skill points from your class. See \pcref{Skill Training}.

\glossdef{critical damage penalties} If you have \glossterm{critical damage}, you take a penalty to attacks, checks, and defenses equal to the amount of critical damage you have.

\glossdef{defense}[defenses] A defense is a static number which represents how difficult you are to affect with attacks. See \glossterm{attack rolls}.

\glossdef{difficult terrain} Difficult terrain costs double the normal movement cost to move through.

\glossdef{hit value} Your hit value is the number of hit points you gain per level. Your hit value is equal to half your Constitution, half your Willpower, or half your base Fortitude bonus, whichever is higher.

\glossdef{potency} The potency of a poison, disease, or similar effect determines its attack bonus

\glossdef{restricted spell}[restricted spells] Arcane spells are divided into two categories: restricted spells, and unrestricted spells. Most spells are unrestricted spells, which can be be learned by both sorcerers and wizards. Restricted spells are listed in italics. Wizards have a limited ability to learn and cast restricted spells with the Arcane Insight class feature (see \pcref{Arcane Insight} for details).

\glossdef{wild magic roll} Whenever a sorcerer casts a spell, he must make a wild magic roll.
Success means he gains a bonus to his spellpower with the spell.
Failure means the spell's miscast effect occurs in addition to its normal effect, and the sorcerer loses the ability to cast spells of the same level.
See \pcref{Wild Magic}, for details.

\glossdef{unrestricted spell}[unrestricted spells] The most common kind of arcane spell. See \glossterm{restricted spells}.
