\chapter{Magic Items}
Magic items are objects that have been imbued with magical energy. They can take almost any form, and their potential uses are only as limited as the magic that created them.

\section{Magic Item Types}
Magic items are divided into three broad categories:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Apparel items provide access to their powers while worn. A \mitem{flaming burst full plate} and a \mitem{ring of protection} are apparel items.
  \item Implements provide access to their powers when wielded. A \mitem{flaming longsword} and a \mitem{wand of fire} are implements.
  \item Tools provide access to their powers when used in some way. A \mitem{bag of holding} is a tool.
\end{itemize}

\parhead{Apparel} There are a wide variety of magic items, but there is a limit to how many apparel items a character can wear at any given time. For humanoid-shaped creatures, there are four core areas on the body that can hold magic items: the arms, the head, the torso, and the legs. A creature can wear only one item in the hands, arms, and legs, but it can use two torso items, provided that they are not identical (such as two belts). In addition, it can wear a suit of armor and two magic rings (one on each hand), for a total of eight item slots. Any additional items worn do not function.

Creatures with non-humanoid body structures may have different arrangement of items. For example, a wolf would be able to wear items on its head, its torso, and on two different sets of legs. Regardless of body shape or size, most creatures may not have more than eight item slots, and many have fewer. A list of common items and their placement on the body is given below.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Arm items:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Bracers, bracelets, gauntlets, and gloves.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Armor
  \item Head items:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Hats, headbands, and helmets
    \end{itemize}
  \item Leg items:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Boots and shoes.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Rings
  \item Torso items:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Amulets, belts, cloaks, mantles, necklaces, robes, shirts, and vests.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Of course, a character may carry or possess as many items of the same type as he wishes. However, additional equipped items beyond those listed above have no effect.

A rare few apparel items can be ``worn'' without taking up space on a character's body. The description of an item indicates when it has this property.

\parhead{Implements} The most common implements are weapons and shields. Spellcasters also often use wands and staves to enhance their power.

\parhead{Tools} Tools can come in many varieties.

\section{Using Magic Items}

To use a magic item, it must be activated, although sometimes activation simply means wearing or holding the item.

\subsection{Daily Item Activations}
In general, you can activate any combination of magic items you possess a number of times per day equal to your level. Once you have used up your activations for the day, you can't activate any more magic items until the next day, though you can continue to use items that don't require activation (such as weapons) normally.

\subsection{Activation Methods}
Magic items can be activated in one of four ways:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Command word
  \item Specific action
  \item Spell completion
  \item Triggered
\end{itemize}

These methods are described below.

\parhead{Command Word} A character must speak a special word defined by the item to activate it. Unless otherwise stated, activating a command word magic item is a standard action.

\parhead{Specific Action} A character must perform a specific action defined by the item to activate it. For example, a creature might need to drink the item, wrap its cloak around itself, or perform some other task. The activation time for such items can be varied. Unless otherwise stated, activating a specific action magic item is a standard action.

\parhead{Spell Completion} A character must complete a spell defined by the item to activate it. Unless otherwise stated, activating a spell completion magic item is a standard action. Both verbal and somatic components may be required, as appropriate to the spell to be completed.

In order to activate a spell completion item, a character must be able to cast spells of that level and he must have that spell on his spell list.

\parhead{Triggered} A creature must fulfill some triggering condition defined by the item to activate it. For example, a triggered magic item might activate when a character strikes a foe, is damaged, or is affected by a particular kind of magic. Unless otherwise stated, activating a triggered item is an immediate action. It is done completely mentally, requiring no physical action, so it can be done even while paralyzed. Some triggered items activate automatically, without requiring an action of any kind.

\section{Magic Item Effects}
Most magic items either provide numerical bonuses or emulate the effect of a spell in some way.

\subsection{Removing Magic Items}
Unless otherwise noted, magic items that have effects on the creature using the item must continue to be worn or held as long as the effect lasts. If a magic item is removed before its effect's duration is up, the effect ends. Items which are consumed when used or which do not affect their user are unaffected by this rule.

\subsection{Special Attacks}

If a magic item requires a successful special attack to have its full effect, the attack bonus is listed in the item's description. Typically, the attack bonus is equal to the level of the item's wielder \add the spell level of the item's effect.

\begin{comment}
\subsection{Charges, Doses, and Multiple Uses}

Many items, particularly wands and staffs, are limited in power by the number of charges they hold. Normally, charged items have 50 charges at most. If such an item is found as a random part of a treasure, roll d\% and divide by 2 to determine the number of charges left (round down, minimum 1). If the item has a maximum number of charges other than 50, roll randomly to determine how many charges are left.

Prices listed are always for fully charged items. (When an item is created, it is fully charged.) An item with no charges left is worth half the price of a fully charged item. For an item that's worthless when its charges run out (which is the case for almost all charged items), the value of the partially used item is proportional to the number of charges left. For an item that has usefulness in addition to its charges, only part of the item's value is based on the number of charges left.
\end{comment}

\section{Magic Item Description Format}

Each general type of magic item gets an overall description, followed by descriptions of specific items.

General descriptions include notes on activation, random generation, and other material. The AC, hardness, hit points, and break DC are given for typical examples of some magic items. The AC assumes that the item is unattended and includes a \minus10 penalty for the item's effective Dexterity of \minus10. If a creature holds the item, use the creature's Dexterity in place of the \minus10 penalty.

Some individual items, notably those that simply store spells and nothing else, don't get full-blown descriptions. Reference the spell's description for details, modified by the form of the item (potion, scroll, wand, and so on). Assume that the spell is cast at the minimum level required to cast it.

Items with full descriptions have their powers detailed, and each of the following topics is covered in notational form at the end of the description.

\parhead{Aura} Most of the time, a Spellcraft check will reveal the school of magic associated with a magic item and the strength of the aura an item emits. This information (when applicable) is given at the beginning of the item's notational entry. See the Spellcraft skill for details.

\parhead{Spellpower} The next item in a notational entry gives the spellpower of the item, indicating its relative power. The spellpower determines the item's special defenses, as well as other level-dependent aspects of the powers of the item (if variable). It also determines the level that must be contended with should the item come under the effect of a dispel magic spell or similar situation. This information is given in the form ``CL x,'' where ``CL'' is an abbreviation for spellpower and ``x'' is a number representing the spellpower itself.

For potions, scrolls, and wands, the creator can set the spellpower of an item at any number high enough to cast the stored spell and not higher than her own spellpower. For other magic items, the spellpower is determined by the item itself. In this case, the creator's spellpower must be as high as the item's spellpower (and prerequisites may effectively put a higher minimum on the creator's level).

\parhead{Requirements} The qualifications that must be met to create the item, %described in \pcref{Creating Magic Items}.

\parhead{Market Price} This gold piece value, given following the word ``Price,'' represents the price someone should expect to pay to buy the item. The market price for an item that can be constructed with an item creation feat is usually equal to the base price plus the price for any components.

\parhead{Cost to Create} The next part of a notational entry is the cost in gp to create the item, given following the word ``Cost.'' This information appears only for items with components which make their market prices higher than their base prices. The cost to create includes the costs derived from the base cost plus the costs of the components.

Items without components do not have a ``Cost'' entry. For them, the market price and the base price are the same. The cost in gp is 1/2 the market price.

\parhead{Weight} The notational entry for many wondrous items ends with a value for the item's weight. When a weight figure is not given, the item has no weight worth noting (for purposes of determining how much of a load a character can carry).

\subsection{Armor and Shields}

Magic body armor and shields protect the wearer to a greater extent than their nonmagical equivalents. All magic armor provides an enhancement bonus to improve your defensive abilities. In addition to an enhancement bonus, armor may have special abilities or be made of an unusual material.

Body armor is always created so that even if the type of armor comes with boots or gauntlets, these pieces can be switched for other magic boots or gauntlets.

\subsubsection{Enhancement Bonuses}\label{Armor Enhancement Bonuses}

Body armor provides an enhancement bonus to your Armor defense. Shields provide an enhancement bonus to all physical defenses. These enhancement bonuses do not stack with each other. If you have both magic armor and a magic shield, use the highest applicable bonus.

\subsubsection{Prices}\label{Armor Prices}
The prices of enhancement bonuses to armor are listed in \trefnp{Magic Armor and Shields}. If armor has a special ability, the price of the special ability is added to the price of the armor. The number of special abilities on the armor cannot exceed the enhancement bonus of the armor. Additionally, the price of all special abilities cannot exceed twice the price of the enhancement bonus on the armor.

\begin{dtable}

    \end{dtabularx}
\end{dtable}

\parhead{Spellpower for Armor and Shields} The spellpower of a magic shield or magic armor with a special ability is given in the item description. For an item with only an enhancement bonus, the spellpower is three times the enhancement bonus. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability, the higher of the two spellpower requirements must be met.

\parhead{Shields} Shield enhancement bonuses do not act as attack or damage bonuses when the shield is used in a bash. However, a shield can be enhanced as a weapon.

\parhead{Hardness and Hit Points} Each \plus1 of enhancement bonus adds 2 to an armor or shield's hardness and \plus10 to its hit points.

\parhead{Activation} A character benefits from magic armor and shields in exactly the way a character benefits from nonmagical armor and shields - by wearing them. Special abilities on body armor are usually activated if the character is struck or damaged, while special abilities on shields are usually activated if the character avoids an attack.

\subsubsection{Special Ability Descriptions}

\appdescription{Bashing, Lesser}{200}{3rd}{Shield}{Faint Transmutation (Augment)}{4th}{\x} When a shield with this ability is used to perform a shield bash, it deals damage as if it were one size category larger (so a Medium light shield deals 1d4 damage, and a Medium heavy shield deals 1d6 damage). This is considered an enhancement bonus, and does not stack with similar abilities.

\mitemreq{Transmutation}{Augment}{2}{4th}{Craft (as shield) 8}

\appdescription{Bashing}{1,000}{6th}{Shield}{Faint Transmutation (Augment)}{6th}{\x} When a shield with this ability is used to perform a shield bash, it deals damage as if it were two size categories larger (so a Medium light shield deals 1d6 damage, and a Medium heavy shield deals 1d8 damage). This is considered an enhancement bonus, and does not stack with similar abilities.

\mitemreq{Transmutation}{Augment}{3}{6th}{Craft (as shield) 10}

\appdescription{Bashing, Greater}{5,000}{10th}{Shield}{Faint Transmutation (Augment)}{10th}{\x} This shield functions like a \magicitem{bashing} shield. In addition, you gain a \plus2 bonus to your physical defenses for 1 round against any creature you successfully shield bash with this shield.

\mitemreq{Transmutation}{Augment}{5}{10th}{Craft (as shield) 14}

\appdescription{Energy Resistance, Lesser}{200}{3rd}{Armor}{Faint Abjuration (Shielding)}{2nd}{Immediate (triggered)} When you take energy damage, you can activate this armor to reduce the damage by 5 \add half your level.

\mitemreq{Abjuration}{Shielding}{1}{2nd}{Craft (as armor) 6}

\appdescription{Energy Resistance}{2,000}{8th}{Armor}{Moderate Abjuration (Shielding)}{6th}{Immediate (triggered)} When you take energy damage, you can activate this armor to gain damage reduction equal to 10 \add half your level against that type of energy damage. In addition, the armor casts light as a torch. The color of the light depends on the energy damage resisted: green for acid, blue for cold, yellow for electricity, and red for fire. Both effects lasts for 5 rounds, during which time you cannot activate the item's abilities.

\mitemreq{Abjuration}{Shielding}{3}{6th}{Craft (as armor) 10}

\appdescription{Flaming Burst}{800}{5th}{Armor, Shield}{Faint Evocation (Energy) [Fire]}{4th}{Immediate (triggered)} When you are struck or missed by a melee attack, you can trigger a burst of flames which sear the foe that attacked you. Body armor triggers if the attack hits, and shields trigger if the attack misses.

If you activate the item, you deal 1d6 fire damage \add d6 per four levels to your attacker. In addition, it is ignited for 5 rounds. An ignited creature is vulnerable, causing it to take a \minus2 penalty to attacks, defenses, and checks. In addition, at the end of each of its turns, it takes d6 damage from the fire. If the creature takes a move action, it can attempt a DC 10 Dexterity check to put out the flames. This action requires a free hand. Dropping prone as part of the action gives a \plus5 bonus on this check.

When you activate this ability, you are wreathed in flame, causing you to cast light as a torch. This effect lasts for 5 rounds, during which time you cannot activate the item's abilities.

\mitemreqdesc{Evocation}{Energy}{Fire}{2}{4th}{Craft (as armor) 8}

\appdescription{Freezing Burst}{800}{5th}{Armor, Shield}{Faint Evocation (Energy) [Cold]}{4th}{Immediate (triggered)} When you are struck or missed by a melee attack, you can trigger a frigid burst against the foe that attacked you. Body armor triggers if the attack hits, and shields trigger if the attack misses.

If you activate the item, you deal 1d6 cold damage \add d6 per four levels to your attacker. In addition, it is fatigued for 5 rounds. A fatigued character can neither sprint nor charge and is vulnerable, giving it a \minus2 penalty to attacks, defenses, and checks.

When you activate this ability, you radiate frigid cold, causing you to snuff out torches and other small fires within a 5 foot radius of you. This effect lasts for 5 rounds, during which time you cannot activate the item's abilities.

\mitemreqdesc{Evocation}{Energy}{Cold}{2}{4th}{Craft (as armor) 8}

\appdescription{Ghost Touch}{1,000}{6th}{Armor, Shield}{Faint Conjuration (Translocation) [Planar]}{6th}{\x} This armor or shield seems almost translucent. You apply the full bonus granted by this armor or shield, including its enhancement bonus, against the attacks of incorporeal creatures. It can be picked up, moved, and worn by incorporeal creatures at any time. Incorporeal creatures gain the armor or shield's enhancement bonus against both corporeal and incorporeal attacks, and they can still pass freely through solid objects.

\mitemreqdesc{Conjuration}{Translocation}{Planar}{3}{6th}{Craft (as armor) 10}

\appdescription{Glamered}{800}{5th}{Armor}{Faint Illusion (Glamer)}{4th}{Standard (specific action)} If you trace the symbol of a mask on your chest (a standard action), this armor appears to change shape and form to assume the appearance of a normal set of clothing. You may choose the design of the clothing. The armor retains all its properties (including weight and sound) when glamered. Only a \spell{true seeing} spell or similar magic reveals the true nature of the armor when disguised. The armor remains disguised until you trace the symbol of the mask in the reverse direction, at which point it regains its normal appearance.

\mitemreq{Illusion}{Glamer}{2}{4th}{Craft (as armor) 8}

\appdescription{Invulnerability}{2,000}{8th}{Armor}{Moderate Abjuration (Shielding)}{8th}{Standard (specific action)} If you strike your chest with a weapon or other hard object (a standard action), this armor grants you physical damage reduction equal to half your level for 5 rounds. This allows you to ignore the first points of physical damage you take each round. If you are hit by an adamantine weapon, you cannot use your damage reduction for 1 round.

\mitemreq{Abjuration}{Shielding}{3}{6th}{Craft (as armor) 10}

\appdescription{Invulnerability, Greater}{30,000}{14th}{Armor}{Moderate Abjuration (Shielding)}{12th}{\x} This armor functions like \magicitem{invulnerability} armor, except that the damage reduction lasts for 12 hours.

\mitemreq{Abjuration}{Shielding}{6}{12th}{Craft (as armor) 16}

\appdescription{Feather}{Varies}{see text}{Armor, Shield}{Varied Transmutation (Augment)}{}{\x}
Feather armor reduces the armor check penalty of the armor it is on. The price of the bonus depends on its penalty reduction, as shown in the table below.

\begin{dtable}

        \minus5 & 62,500 gp & 16th \\
    \end{dtabularx}
\end{dtable}

The spellpower is equal to three times the item's penalty reduction. To craft the item, you must have a number of ranks in the relevant Craft skill equal to the item's spellpower \add 4.

\appdescriptiondc{Shocking Burst}{2,000}{8th}{Armor, Shield}{Faint Evocation (Energy) [Electricity]}{6th}{Immediate (triggered)}{Fortitude (level \add 3)} When you are struck or missed by a melee attack, you can trigger a powerful jolt of electricity that zaps the foe that attacked you. Body armor triggers if the attack hits, and shields trigger if the attack misses.

If you activate the item, you deal 1d6 electricity damage \add d6 per four levels to your attacker. In addition, if you succeed at a Fortitude attack, it is staggered for 5 rounds. A staggered character may take a single move action or standard action each round, but not both. She cannot take full-round actions, but she may take swift actions. In addition, she is vulnerable, causing her to take a \minus2 penalty on attacks, defenses, and checks.

When you activate this ability, you crackle with electrical energy, causing you to radiate flashing light as a torch. This effect lasts for 5 rounds, during which time you cannot activate the item's abilities.

\mitemreqdesc{Evocation}{Energy}{Electricity}{3}{6th}{Craft (as armor) 10}

\appdescription{Spell Reflecting}{60,000}{16th}{Shield}{Strong Abjuration (Shielding) [Magic]}{14th}{Immediate (triggered)} This shield's surface is completely reflective, allowing it to act as a mirror. When you are targeted by a spell or spell-like ability, you can activate the shield to reflect the spell back at its caster exactly like the \spell{spell turning} spell.

After you activate this ability, the shield's surface becomes dully metallic instead of reflective. This effect lasts for 5 rounds, during which time you cannot activate the item's abilities.

\mitemreqdesc{Abjuration}{Shielding}{Magic}{7}{14th}{Craft (as armor) 18}

\appdescription{Spell Resistance}{5,000}{10th}{Armor}{Moderate Abjuration (Shielding) [Magic]}{8th}{Standard (specific action)} If you crouch low and strike the ground with your fist (a standard action), this armor grants you spell resistance. The spell resistance lasts as long as you remain crouching, and for 5 rounds thereafter (maximum 5 minutes). You can move at half speed while crouching.

To affect a creature with spell resistance using a spell or spell-like ability, a special attack is always required. The defense used against the attack is indicated by the spell. If the attack fails, the spell has no effect.

\mitemreqdesc{Abjuration}{Shielding}{Magic}{4}{8th}{Craft (as armor) 12}

\subsection{Arms}

\appdescription{Bracers of Archery}{Varies}{see text}{Arms}{Varied Transmutation (Augment)}{}{\x} While you wear these bracers, you gain an enhancement bonus to physical attacks with bows and crossbows. The price of the amulet depends on its enhancement bonus, as shown in the table below.

\end{dtable}

The spellpower is equal to three times the item's enhancement bonus. To craft the item, you must have a number of ranks in Craft (leather or metal) equal to the item's spellpower \add 4.

\mitemreq{Transmutation}{Augment}{1}{varies}{Craft (leather or metal) varies}

\appdescription{Bracers of Armor}{Varies}{see text}{Arms}{Abjuration (Shielding) [Force]}{}{\x} While you wear these bracers, you gain an invisible but tangible field of force that acts as armor. The armor bonus provided by the bracers depends on its bonus, as shown on the table below. Since this armor is made of magical force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor. Armor from the bracers is considered a separate piece of armor from any body armor you wear, so they do not stack; use the higher of the two values.

\section{Implements}

\subsection{Weapons}

Magic weapons improve a character's combat abilities. They always provide an enhancement bonus to a character's attack and damage with attacks using the weapon. In addition to an enhancement bonus, weapons may have special abilities or be made of an unusual material.

\parhead{Weapon Prices} The prices of enhancement bonuses to weapons are listed in \trefnp{Magic Weapons}, and the prices of special abilities are listed on \trefnp{Weapon Special Abilities}. If a weapon has a special ability, the price of the special ability is added to the price of the weapon.

\begin{dtable}
\lcaption{Magic Weapons}
\begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth} {>{\ccol}X c c}
  \thead{Enhancement Bonus} & \thead{Base Price} & \thead{Item Level}\\
\hline
\plus1 weapon & 200 gp & 3rd \\
\plus2 weapon & 1,000 gp & 6th \\
\plus3 weapon & 5,000 gp & 10th \\
\plus4 weapon & 25,000 gp & 13th \\
\plus5 weapon & 125,000 gp & 17th \\
\end{dtabularx}
\end{dtable}

\parhead{Special Ability Limitations} The number of special abilities on the weapon cannot exceed the enhancement bonus of the weapon. Additionally, the price of all special abilities cannot exceed twice the price of the enhancement bonus on the weapon.

\parhead{Spellpower for Weapons} The spellpower of a magic weapon with a special ability is given in the item description. For an item with only an enhancement bonus, the spellpower is three times the enhancement bonus. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability, the higher of the two spellpower requirements must be met.

\parhead{Hardness and Hit Points} Each \plus1 of enhancement bonus adds 2 to a weapon's hardness and \plus10 to its hit points.

\parhead{Ranged Weapons and Ammunition} The enhancement bonus from a ranged weapon does not stack with the enhancement bonus from ammunition. Only the higher of the two enhancement bonuses applies. Special abilities are applied from both sources, as long as they are not identical. If conflicting special abilities exist, the special ability on the ammunition takes precedence.

Magic ammunition loses its magic after being fired, whether it hits or misses.

\parhead{Light Generation} Some magic weapons shed light equivalent to a light spell (bright light in a 20-foot radius, shadowy light in a 40-foot radius). These glowing weapons are quite obviously magical. Such a weapon can't be concealed when drawn, nor can its light be shut off. Some of the specific weapons detailed below always or never glow, as defined in their descriptions.

\parhead{Activation} Usually, a character benefits from a magic weapon in the same way a character benefits from a mundane weapon - by attacking with it. Special abilities on weapons are usually activated if the character strikes a foe with the weapon.

\parhead{Magic Weapons and Critical Hits} Some weapon qualities and some specific weapons have an extra effect on a critical hit. These special effects function against creatures not subject to critical hits. When fighting against such creatures, roll for critical hits as you would against any other creature subject to critical hits. On a successful critical roll, apply the special effect, but do not multiply the weapon's regular damage.

\subsubsection{Bane} \parhead{Price (Level)} Special \parhead{Aura, Spellpower} Special \par
A bane weapon excels at attacking a specific type of creature. Any weapon special ability can be designated as a ``bane'' ability, causing it to only function against a specific kind of creature. In exchange, the ability costs half the normal price in raw materials to add to the weapon. A list of possible foes is described on the following table.

However, you add its enhancement bonus to your physical defenses for 1 round whenever you make a full attack or take the total defense action. If you spin the weapon counter-clockwise, the weapon instead applies its bonus to your attack and damage, as normal.

\impdescription{Entangling}{400}{4th}{Faint Conjuration (Creation)}{2nd}{Immediate (triggered)} When you strike a foe with this weapon, you can cause webbing to spring into existence, entangling the struck foe for 5 rounds. The foe can break out of the webbing with a grapple or Escape Artist check against a DC equal to 15 \add your level.

An entangled creature moves at half speed, cannot run or charge, and takes a \minus2 penalty to physical attacks and defenses, as well as Strength and Dexterity-based checks. An entangled character who attempts to cast a spell must make a Concentration check (DC 10 \add double the spell's level) or lose the spell.

\impdescription{Flaming}{400}{4th}{Faint Evocation (Energy) [Fire]}{2nd}{Immediate (triggered)} When you strike a foe with this weapon, you can engulf the struck creature in flames. If you do, it is ignited for 5 rounds. An ignited creature is vulnerable, causing it to take a \minus2 penalty to attacks, defenses, and checks. In addition, at the end of each of its turns, it takes d6 damage from the fire. If the creature takes a move action, it can attempt a DC 10 Dexterity check to put out the flames. This action requires a free hand. Dropping prone as part of the action gives a \plus5 bonus on this check.

When you activate this ability, the weapon is wreathed in flames, causing damage you deal with it to be treated as fire damage in addition to its other types. This effect lasts for 5 rounds, during which time you cannot activate the item's abilities.

\impdescription{Freezing}{400}{4th}{Faint Evocation (Energy) [Cold]}{2nd}{Immediate (triggered)} When you strike a foe with this weapon, you can unleash an icy blast from the weapon. If you do, your foe is fatigued for 5 rounds. A fatigued creature can neither sprint nor charge and is vulnerable, giving it a \minus2 penalty to attacks, defenses, and checks.

When you activate this ability, the weapon radiates chilling cold, causing damage you deal with it to be treated as cold damage in addition to its other types. This effect lasts for 5 rounds, during which time you cannot activate the item's abilities.

\impdescription{Forceful}{400}{4th}{Faint Evocation (Control)}{4th}{Immediate (triggered)} When you strike a foe with this weapon, you can activate the weapon to immediately make a shove attempt with a circumstance bonus equal to the damage you dealt with the attack. You do not have to move with your foe to knock it back the full distance.

After you activate this ability, the weapon feels heavier in your hands. This effect lasts for 5 rounds, during which time you cannot activate the item's abilities.

\impdescription{Heartseeking}{12,000}{12th}{Moderate Divination (Awareness)}{10th}{Immediate (triggered)} When you strike the same foe with this weapon for multiple rounds in a row, you can suddenly perceive a critical weakness in your foe's defenses. You must strike the foe for a number of consecutive rounds equal to the critical multiplier of the weapon you are using. If you activate the item, the final hit automatically becomes a confirmed critical hit. This has no effect on creatures immune to critical hits.

When you activate this ability, you gain a \plus4 bonus to confirm critical hits. This effect lasts for 5 rounds, during which time you cannot activate the item's abilities.

\impdescription{Morphing}{200}{6th}{Faint Transmutation (Alteration)}{4th}{Standard (specific action)} A morphing weapon can transform into any other weapon from its weapon group. To transform a morphing weapon, you must grab it with both hands and strike it against your knee or other hard object, as if breaking it, while visualizing its new form (a standard action). It remains transformed until you transform it again.

\impdescription{Poisoning}{1,600}{7th}{Faint Conjuration/Transmutation (Creation, Temporal)}{4th}{Swift (specific action) and standard (specific action)} A poisoning weapon can conjure poisons to cover the striking surface of the weapon. The poison must first be inserted into a small slot in the hilt of the weapon (a standard action). Once a poison is present in the slot, you can coat the weapon with a dose of the poison by pressing a small button on the hilt (a swift action). After a poison has been used, it takes 5 rounds for the weapon to create more poison, during which time the weapon cannot be activated. Only liquid poisons worth 100 gp per dose or less can be duplicated in this way.

The poison within the weapon is kept fresh magically, decaying at a rate of one minute per day. The weapon can be emptied by pressing a second button to open its slot and pouring the poison out (a standard action). You can freely insert and remove poison from the weapon, but coating the weapon in poison costs an activation.

\impdescription{Returning}{1,000}{6th}{Faint Conjuration (Translocation) [Teleportation]}{4th}{\x} After being thrown or fired, a returning weapon teleports back to the creature that threw or fired it. It returns to the thrower just before the creature's next turn (and is therefore ready to use again in that turn).

Catching a returning weapon when it comes back is a free action. If you can't catch it, the weapon drops to the ground in the square from which it was thrown.

\impdescription{Soulreaving}{60,000}{16th}{Strong Necromancy (Soul)}{16th}{\x and standard (specific action)} This ghostly, translucent weapon strikes directly at the target's soul. It ignores all damage reduction, but it does not deal hit point damage. In fact, a creature struck by the weapon does not feel the attack at all. Damage that would be dealt by the weapon can be delayed indefinitely. While the damage is delayed, it cannot be cured or dispelled.

In order to convert the delayed damage into real damage, the wielder must stab themselves through the heart with the weapon as a standard action. This deals no damage to the wielder, but any creatures that have been dealt damage by the weapon immediately take lethal damage equal to the delayed damage the weapon has stored up for them. Any such damage dealt in excess of the creature's hit points is converted directly into critical damage.

A soulreaver weapon has no effect on objects or constructs. While wielded, it has physical form only for its wielder, making it impossible to disarm. While not in use, it can be picked up and touched normally.

If you do, make a Fortitude attack. If you succeed, your foe is staggered for 5 rounds. A staggered creature may take a single move action or standard action each round, but not both. She cannot take full-round actions, but she may take swift actions. In addition, she is vulnerable, causing her to take a \minus2 penalty on attacks, defenses, and checks.

When you activate this ability, the weapon crackles with electrical energy, causing damage you deal with it to be treated as electrical damage in addition to its other types. This effect lasts for 5 rounds, during which time you cannot activate the item's abilities.

If you do, the object is absorbed into the weapon, leaving no trace that it ever existed. Striking an attended object requires a successful disarm attempt.

You can retrieve objects from the weapon by running your hand along the length of the striking surface of the weapon (a standard action). If you do, the last item absorbed by the weapon appears in your hand. You may freely retrieve objects from within the weapon, but absorbing objects costs an activation.

The weapon can hold no more than three objects at once. If you attempt to absorb an object while the weapon is full, the attempt fails.

\subsection{Rods}

Rods are scepterlike devices that have unique magical powers and do not usually have charges. Anyone can use a rod.

\parhead{Physical Description} Rods weigh approximately 5 pounds.

They range from 2 feet to 3 feet long and are usually made of iron or some other metal. (Many, as noted in their descriptions, can function as light maces or clubs due to their sturdy construction.)

These sturdy items have AC 9, 10 hit points, hardness 10, and a break DC of 27.

\parhead{Activation} Details relating to rod use vary from item to item. See the individual descriptions for specifics.

\subsection{Staffs}

A staff is a long shaft, usually made of wood, that enhances a spellcaster's power. Staffs function exactly like wands (see below), except that they enhance all schools of magic at once.

\parhead{Staff Prices} Enhancement bonuses on staffs are three times as expensive as wands, but staffs otherwise use the same pricing rules as wands.

\begin{dtable}

        \plus5 staff & 93,750 gp & 17th \\
    \end{dtabularx}
\end{dtable}

\parhead{Physical Description} A typical staff is 4 feet to 7 feet long and 2 inches to 3 inches thick, weighing about 5 pounds. Most staffs are wood, but a rare few are bone, metal, or even glass. (These are extremely exotic.) Staffs often have a gem or some device at their tip or are shod in metal at one or both ends. Staffs are often decorated with carvings or runes. A typical staff is like a walking stick, quarterstaff, or cudgel. It has AC 7, 10 hit points, hardness 5, and a break DC of 24.

\parhead{Activation} Staffs use the same activation method as wands.

\subsection{Holy Symbols}
A holy symbol is a small object that enhances a divine spellcaster's power. Holy symbols function exactly like wands (see below), except that they enhance all schools of magic at once.

\parhead{Holy Symbol Prices} Enhancement bonuses on holy symbols are three times as expensive as wands, but holy symbols otherwise use the same pricing rules as wands.

\begin{dtable}

        \plus5 holy symbol & 93,750 gp & 17th \\
    \end{dtabularx}
\end{dtable}

\parhead{Physical Description} A typical holy symbol is a no larger than 4 inches in each dimension and can be easily held in the palm of a hand. Most holy symbols are metal, but they can be made from wood, bone, or even more exotic materials, depending on the deity they symbolize.

Many holy symbols are designed to be worn as an amulet in addition to being held in the hand. When worn in this way, the holy symbol occupies a torso body slot.

\parhead{Activation} Holy symbols use the same activation method as wands.

\subsection{Wands}

A wand is a thin baton that enhances a spellcaster's power. Wands always provide an enhancement bonus to spellpower with a particular school of magic. In addition to an enhancement bonus, wands may have special abilities or be made of an unusual material.

\parhead{Wand Prices} The prices of enhancement bonuses to wands are listed in \trefnp{Magic Wands}, and the prices of special abilities are listed on \trefnp{Wand Special Abilities}. If a wand has a special ability, the price of the special ability is added to the price of the wand.

\parhead{Special Ability Limitations} The number of special abilities on the wand cannot exceed the enhancement bonus of the wand. Additionally, the price of all special abilities cannot exceed twice the price of the enhancement bonus on the wand.

\subparhead{Multiple Schools} Some rare wands provide bonuses to two schools. The enhancement bonus on a wand costs twice as much if it provides bonuses to two schools. A wand cannot provide an enhancement bonus to more than two schools.

\section{Tools}

\subsection{Scrolls}
A scroll is a spell (or collection of spells) that has been stored in written form. A spell on a scroll can be used only once. The writing vanishes from the scroll when the spell is activated. Using a scroll is basically like casting a spell.

\parhead{Physical Description} A scroll is a heavy sheet of fine vellum or high-quality paper. An area about 8 1/2 inches wide and 11 inches long is sufficient to hold one spell. The sheet is reinforced at the top and bottom with strips of leather slightly longer than the sheet is wide. A scroll holding more than one spell has the same width (about 8 1/2 inches) but is an extra foot or so long for each extra spell. Scrolls that hold three or more spells are usually fitted with reinforcing rods at each end rather than simple strips of leather. A scroll has AC 9, 1 hit point, hardness 0, and a break DC of 8.

To protect it from wrinkling or tearing, a scroll is rolled up from both ends to form a double cylinder. (This also helps the user unroll the scroll quickly.) The scroll is placed in a tube of ivory, jade, leather, metal, or wood. Most scroll cases are inscribed with magic symbols which often identify the owner or the spells stored on the scrolls inside. The symbols often hide magic traps.

\parhead{Activation} To activate a scroll, a spellcaster must read the spell written on it. Doing so involves several steps and conditions.

\parhead{Decipher the Writing} The writing on a scroll must be deciphered before a character can use it or know exactly what spell it contains. This requires a \ritual{read magic} ritual or a successful Spellcraft check (DC 20 \add spell level).

Deciphering a scroll to determine its contents does not activate its magic unless it is a specially prepared cursed scroll. A character can decipher the writing on a scroll in advance so that he or she can proceed directly to the next step when the time comes to use the scroll.

\parhead{Activate the Spell} Activating a scroll requires reading the spell from the scroll. The character must be able to see and read the writing on the scroll. Activating a scroll spell requires no material components or focus. (The creator of the scroll provided these when scribing the scroll.) Note that some spells are effective only when cast on an item or items. In such a case, the scroll user must provide the item when activating the spell. Activating a scroll spell is subject to disruption just as casting a normally prepared spell would be. Using a scroll is like casting a spell for purposes of arcane spell failure chance.

To have any chance of activating a spell scroll, the scroll user must meet the following requirements.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The user's spellpower must be at least equal to the scroll's spellpower.
    \item The user must have the spell on his or her spell list. The spell list must be of the same magic type as the scroll (arcane, divine, or nature).
    \item The user must have the minimum casting attribute required to cast spells of the scroll's spell level. For arcane magic, the minimum attribute is equal to the spell's level. For divine and nature magic, the minimum attribute is equal to half the spell's level.
\end{itemize}

\parhead{Determine Effect} A spell successfully activated from a scroll works exactly like a spell cast the normal way. The spellpower of a spell cast from a scroll is equal to twice the spell's level.

Once a scroll has been activated, the writing disappears from it, leaving behind only faint traces with no magical power.

\parhead{Scroll Levels} Some spells are acquired by multiple classes at different levels. Use the entry on the table appropriate to the scribing of each individual scroll.

\begin{dtable}

\end{dtable}

\subsection{Potions and Oils}

A potion is a magic liquid that produces its effect when imbibed. Magic oils are similar to potions, except that oils are applied externally rather than imbibed. A potion or oil can be used only once. It can duplicate the effect of a spell that has a casting time of a standard action or less.

Potions are like spells cast upon the imbiber. The character taking the potion doesn't get to make any decisions about the effect  - the caster who brewed the potion has already done so. The drinker of a potion is both the effective target and the effective caster of the effect.

The person applying an oil is the effective caster, but the object is the target.

\parhead{Physical Description} A typical potion or oil consists of 1 ounce of liquid held in a ceramic or glass vial fitted with a tight stopper. The stoppered container is usually no more than 1 inch wide and 2 inches high. The vial has AC 13, 1 hit point, hardness 1, and a break DC of 12. Vials hold 1 ounce of liquid.

\parhead{Identifying Potions} In addition to the standard methods of identification, PCs can sample from each container they find to attempt to determine the nature of the liquid inside. An experienced character learns to identify potions by memory -- for example, the last time she tasted a liquid that reminded her of almonds, it turned out to be a potion of cure moderate wounds.

\parhead{Activation} Drinking a potion or applying an oil requires no special skill. The user merely removes the stopper and swallows the potion or smears on the oil. The following rules govern potion and oil use.

Drinking a potion or using an oil on an item of gear is a standard action. The potion or oil takes effect immediately.

A creature must be able to swallow a potion or smear on an oil. Because of this, incorporeal creatures cannot use potions or oils.

Any corporeal creature can imbibe a potion. The potion must be swallowed, or in some other way ingested. Any corporeal creature can use an oil.

A character can carefully administer a potion to an unconscious creature as a full-round action, trickling the liquid down the creature's throat. Likewise, it takes a full-round action to apply an oil to an unconscious creature. Exceptionally large objects or creatures require a greater time expenditure.

\parhead{Potion Descriptions} The spellpower for a standard potion is equal to twice the spell level of the spell in the potion. Common potions refer to potions of spells on the unrestricted arcane, divine, and nature lists. Any other spells, such as cleric domain spells and restricted arcane spells, are considered ``uncommon''.

\parhead{Potion Mishaps} Extraordinarily powerful potions can be dangerous to imbibe. Whenever you use a potion, if the spellpower of the potion exceeds your level, roll 1d20 and subtract the difference between your level and the potion's spellpower. Compare the result to \trefnp{Potion Mishaps}.

\begin{dtable}
    \lcaption{Potion Mishaps}

\subsection{Wondrous Items}

Wondrous items are items which are inherently magical in some way.

\tooldescription{Answerstone}{2,000}{8th}{Faint Divination (Knowledge)}{6th}{Standard (specific action)} If you shake this stone and ask a simple yes or no question (a standard action), you receive an answer of either ``yes'', ``no'', or ``unclear''. The answer has a 75\% chance of being correct. If the answerstone is incorrect, it will always answer ``unclear''. The answerstone will always answer ``unclear'' if asked questions about events more than thirty minutes into the future or past, farther than ten miles from its current location. It can only answer questions about observable quantities (including spells).

If you attempt to use an answerstone when you have no uses of magic items remaining, it will give random answers, including answers other than ``yes'', ``no'', and ``unknown''. Although answerstones are usually made of stone, they can also be made of other sturdy materials.

\tooldescription{Bag of Holding}{Varies}{see text}{Varied Conjuration (Translocation) [Planar]}{}{\x} This appears to be a common cloth sack about 2 feet by 4 feet in size. The bag of holding opens into a nondimensional space: Its inside is larger than its outside dimensions. Regardless of what is put into the bag, it weighs a fixed amount. This weight, and the limits in weight and volume of the bag's contents, depend on the bag's type, as shown on the table below.

\begin{dtable*}
    \begin{dtabularx}{\textwidth}{l l X X X X}
        \thead{Bag} & \thead{Bag Weight} & \thead{Weight Limit} & \thead{Space Limit} & \thead{Base Price} & \thead{Item Level}\\
\hline
        Type I & 15 lb. & 250 lb. & 5 ft. radius & 750 gp & 5th \\
        Type II & 20 lb. & 500 lb. & 10 ft. radius & 1,500 gp & 7th \\
        Type III & 25 lb. & 1,000 lb. & 15 ft. radius & 3,000 & 9th \\
        Type IV & 30 lb. & 1,500 lb. & 20 ft. radius & 6,000 & 10th \\
    \end{dtabularx}
\end{dtable*}

If the bag is overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce it from the outside, the bag ruptures and is ruined. All contents are lost forever. If a bag of holding is turned inside out, its contents spill out, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. If living creatures are placed within the bag, they can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time they suffocate. Retrieving a specific item from a bag of holding is a move action - unless the bag contains more than an ordinary backpack would hold, in which case retrieving a specific item is a full-round action.

If a bag of holding is placed within a portable hole a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in the space: Bag and hole alike are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a portable hole is placed within a bag of holding, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane: The hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, destroying the portable hole and bag of holding in the process.

\tooldescription{Bag of Tricks}{Varies}{see text}{Varied Conjuration (Summoning)}{}{\x} This small sack appears normal and empty. However, anyone reaching into the bag feels a small, fuzzy ball. If the ball is removed and tossed up to 20 feet away, it turns into an animal. The animal serves the character who drew it from the bag for 1 minute (or until slain or ordered back into the bag), at which point it disappears. It can follow any of the commands described in the Creature Handling skill. Each of the three kinds of a bag of tricks produces a different set of animals. Use the following tables to determine what animals can be drawn out of each.

Animals produced are always random, and only one may exist at a time. If a new animal is drawn from the bag, the previous animal is immediately unsummoned.

\tooldescription{Bead of Force}{600}{5th}{Moderate Evocation (Control) [Force]}{10th}{Standard (specific action)} This small black sphere appears to be a lusterless pearl. By holding it in your hand and throwing it at an object or creature, you can surround the struck target with a \spell{resilient sphere}, as the spell. The bead is treated as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 20 feet.  Your Reflex attack bonus for the \spell{resilient sphere} effect is equal to your level \add 5.

If you miss your target, the bead will still activate if it strikes a solid object, potentially wasting its effect. After being activated, the bead is destroyed.

\tooldescription{Bottle of Air}{800}{5th}{Faint Conjuration (Creation)}{4th}{Standard (specific action)} This item appears to be a normal glass bottle with a cork. By uncorking the bottle (a standard action), you can cause the bottle to continually fill itself with clean air for 1 hour. It will remain filled with clean air even if taken into an airless environment or environment with dangerous gases, allowing you to breathe from the bottle. Liquid can still fill the bottle, and the bottle will continuously bubble as air is created until the liquid is removed.

The bottle can even be shared by multiple creatures who pass it around. Breathing out of the bottle is a standard action, but a creature that does so can then act for as long as it can hold its breath.

The zone lasts as long as the candle remains lit, which is normally 1 hour. If the candle is snuffed, the zone immediately ends. Relighting the candle does not recreate the zone.

\tooldescription{Friendstone}{3,000}{9th}{Strong Conjuration/Divination (Scrying, Translocation) [Teleportation]}{14th}{Standard (specific action)} This item appears to be a glossy, smooth stone about three inches in diameter. It can be used to summon a willing creature from a great distance. By pressing the stone to your forehead and speaking your full name, you can activate the stone to make it attune to you, allowing you to be summoned by a creature using the stone. This replaces the stone's attunement to any other creature.

By grasping the stone in your hand and throwing it to the ground, you can activate cause the stone to transport the creature attuned to the stone to the stone's location. The creature is granted a brief glimpse of the stone's surroundings, as if looking out through the stone, and may refuse the summoning. If the creature refuses, or if it is physically impossible for the creature to appear, your activation of the stone has no effect. If the creature accepts, the stone is destroyed and the creature is unerringly teleported into the stone's location.

This item is usually made of stone, but can also be made from glass.

\tooldescription{Witch's Broom}{60,000}{16th}{Strong Divination/Transmutation (Communication, Imbuement)}{14th}{Standard (specific action)} This broom can fly as directed by its owner, as the \ritual{overland flight} ritual. Riding the broom is like riding a mount, except that you do not need to control it and some actions (such as taking cover behind the mount) are infeasible due to the shape of the broom.

In addition to riding the broom, you attune to the broom as a standard action by holding it firmly by the handle and concentrating. If you have attuned to the broom, you can command it to fly on its own by specifying a location or a direction and distance. The broom understands all locations that you know. If the broom is within \rngext range of you and can hear your commands, it will obey your commands after 1 round. Both attuning to the broom and issuing a command to the broom count as activating the broom, but simply riding the broom does not.

\section{Special Materials}

Some materials are inherently magical. Items made from such materials gain special properties automatically.

\subsection{Material Types}
There are three main types of materials used to create items: metal, wood, and leather. In order to create an item with a special material, the item must normally be made with a material of the appropriate material type. In the case of items that are made from multiple materials, such as polearms, the primary functional part of the item determines which type of special material can be used to create it. For example, the material type for a weapon is generally determined by its striking surface.

\subsection{Special Material Descriptions}

\begin{dtable}
    \lcaption{Special Materials}
    \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{l l X l}
        \thead{Material Name} & \thead{Material Type} & \thead{Effect} & \thead{Price} \\
\hline
        Adamantine & Metal & Grant or overcome physical damage reduction & \\
        Cold Iron & Metal & Effective against supernatural creatures & \\
        Darkwood & Wood & Extraordinarily light & \\
        Dragonbone & Metal & Inherently magical & \\
        Dragonhide & Leather & Resist energy & \\
        Dragonscale & Metal & Resist energy & \\
        Ironwood & Metal & Metallic wood & \\
        Mithral & Metal & Extraordinarily light & \\
        Silvered & Metal & Effective against supernatural creatures & \\
    \end{dtabularx}
\end{dtable}

\parhead{Adamantine}
Adamantine is a rare metal that is among the hardest substances known.

Adamantine weapons ignore the hardness of creatures and objects.

Adamantine armor grants its wearer physical damage reduction equal to half your level. This damage reduction is overcome by adamantine weapons.

Adamantine items of any kind have double the hit points and hardness of an equivalent item of the same type.

\parhead{Cold Iron}

Cold iron is iron that has been magically smelted without the use of heat.

Cold iron items are especially effective against some supernatural creatures, as indicated in the creature descriptions.

\parhead{Darkwood}
Darkwood is a rare magic wood that is very light.

Darkwood weapons have the Finesse weapon property, allowing you to use Dexterity to attack with them instead of Strength.

Darkwood shields have their armor check penalty reduced by 2.

Darkwood items of any kind weigh half as much as an equivalent item of the same type.

\parhead{Dragonbone}

Dragon bones can be used in place of metal when creating weapons and armor.

Dragonbone weapons grant an enhancement bonus to physical attack and damage equal to a third of your level (to a maximum of \plus5 at 15th level).

Dragonbone armor grants its wearer spell resistance. To affect a creature with spell resistance using a spell or spell-like ability, a special attack is always required. The defense used against the attack is indicated by the spell. If the attack fails, the spell has no effect on the creature.

\parhead{Dragonhide}

Dragon hide can be used as leather when creating weapons and armor.

Dragonhide armor grants damage reduction equal to your level against the energy type used by the dragon the hide is taken from.

\parhead{Dragonscale}

Dragon scales can be used in place of metal when creating armor.

Dragonscale armor grants damage reduction equal to your level against the energy type used by the dragon the hide is taken from.

\parhead{Ironwood}
Ironwood is a magic wood created by the \spell{ironwood} ritual. It has been magically hardened, giving it the strength of iron. Ironwood can be used in place of metal when creating weapons and armor.

Ironwood items have no special properties except that they are made from wood instead of metal.

\parhead{Mithral}
Mithral is a rare metal that is very light, but has the strength of iron.

Mithral weapons have the Finesse weapon property, allowing you to use Dexterity to attack with them instead of Strength.

Mithral armor has its armor check penalty reduced by 4.

Mithral items of any kind weigh half as much of an equivalent item of the same type.

\parhead{Silvered}

Silvered items have silver infused into them in the process of their creation. Only metal items can be silvered.

Silvered items are especially effective against some supernatural creatures, as indicated in the creature descriptions.

\section{Magic Item Rules}

\subsection{Magic Item Auras}

Magic items radiate magical auras which can be detected with the Spellcraft skill (see \pcref{Spellcraft}). Each item describes the auras that can be detected on it, including the strength, school, and descriptors, as appropriate.

\subsection{Damaging Magic Items}

A magic item is normally unharmed by attacks unless it is unattended or is specifically targeted by an effect. A magic item's special defenses are all equal to 10 \add the spellpower of the item. The only exceptions to this are intelligent magic items, which apply their Charisma and Intelligence to their Mental defense.

Magic items, unless otherwise noted, take damage as nonmagical items of the same sort. A damaged magic item continues to function, but if it is broken, its magic ceases to function until it is repaired. If it is destroyed, all its magical power is lost.

\subsection{Repairing Magic Items}

A magic item which is broken (but not destroyed) can be repaired for 10\% of the value of the item.

\subsection{Intelligent Items}

Some magic items, particularly weapons, have an intelligence all their own. Only permanent magic items (as opposed to those with a single use or those with charges) can be intelligent. (This means that potions, scrolls, and wands, among other items, are never intelligent.)

In general, fewer than 1\% of magic items have intelligence.

\subsection{Cursed Items}

Some items are cursed - incorrectly made, or corrupted by outside forces. Cursed items might be particularly dangerous to the user, or they might be normal items with a minor flaw, an inconvenient requirement, or an unpredictable nature. Many cursed items are difficult to identify and remove, requiring the use of rituals such as \spell{remove curse}.
