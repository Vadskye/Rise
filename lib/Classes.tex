\chapter{Classes}

Your character's class represents the things your character has chosen to train in.

\subsection{Class Description Format}

\parhead{Alignment}
Some classes require specific alignments (see \pcref{Alignment}).
Most classes allow characters of any alignment.

\parhead{Class Skills}
These are skills that members of this class are typically good at (see \pcref{Skills}).

\subsubsection{Base Class Features}

Abilities contained within this heading only apply to characters with the current class as a base class.
A character can normally have only one base class.
Except in unusual circumstances, a character's base class is the class that the character took at 1st level.

\parhead{Skill Points}
This is the number of skill points that members of this class get.

\parhead{Defenses}
Each class grants bonuses to defenses the class specializes in.
If the class has a good base defense progression, it grants a \plus4 bonus to that defense.
If the class has an average base defense progression, it grants a \plus2 bonus to that defense.
These bonuses apply regardless of the attribute or base progression used to determine the defense.

These bonuses do not stack with other defense bonuses granted by base classes.
If a character has multiple base classes, use the highest bonuses that apply to each defense.

\parhead{Weapon and Armor Proficiencies}
These are the types of equipment that members of this class are trained in using.

\subsection{Base Progressions}

The tables summarizing the abilities granted by each class contain information about the combat prowess and defenses that each class provides.

\parhead{Combat Prowess}
This measures how skilled a character is in combat.
A character can use his combat prowess to determine his Armor and Maneuver defenses, and his accuracy with physical attacks.
There are three progressions: Good, Average, or Poor.
The effects of each progression are described on \trefnp{Base Progressions}.

A high combat prowess can grant additional attacks, as described in \pcref{Multiple Attacks}.

\parhead{Base Defense}\label{Base Defense Progressions}
This measures how resistant members of the class are to unusual kinds of attacks.
There are three kinds of special defenses.
Your Fortitude defense represents your ability to resist attacks to your body, like poisons and diseases.
Your Reflex defense represents your ability to avoid attacks, such as pit traps or explosions.
Your Mental defense represents your ability to resist mental influence, like fearsome creatures and enchantment spells.
There are three progressions: Good, Average, or Poor.
The effects of each progression are described on \trefnp{Base Progressions}.

\subsection{Class Features}
All barbarians have the following abilities.

\cf{Bbn}{Rage}[Ex]
Twice per day, a barbarian can fly into a rage as a free action.
Raging has the following benefits and drawbacks:

    \item \plus2 bonus to damage with physical attacks.
    \item \plus2 bonus to Fortitude and Mental defense.

\end{itemize}

A rage typically lasts for up to 5 rounds.
At the end of the rage, the barbarian takes nonlethal damage equal to his barbarian level.
If the barbarian has any temporary hit points remaining at the end of his rage, the nonlethal damage is dealt to those hit points before they go away.
In addition, he becomes \fatigued until he rests for 5 minutes.
The barbarian cannot enter a rage while he is fatigued from his previous rage.

The barbarian must have the terrifying rage ability to choose this ability.

\subcf{14th -- Spellbreaker Rage (Su)}
The barbarian gains spell resistance equal to 10 \add his Constitution.
To affect the barbarian with a spell, a caster must make an attack with an accuracy equal to its spellpower.
If the attack beats the barbarian's spell resistance, the spell works normally.
Otherwise, the spell has no effect on the barbarian.

\subcf{14th -- Taunting Rage, Improved}
This channeled rage functions like taunting rage, except that it affects all foes the barbarians threatens.
The barbarian must have the taunting rage rage ability to choose this ability.

The barbarian increases his land speed by 10 feet while \unencumbered.

\cf{Bbn}[7th]{Tireless Rage}[Ex]
The barbarian does not take damage when his rage ends, and is not \fatigued at the end of his rage.
This can allow him to rage multiple times without resting.

\cf{Bbn}[8th]{Larger than Life}[Ex]
A barbarian holds the strength of a giant in the body of a man (or woman).
The barbarian is treated as being one size category larger than he actually is for all purposes except his physical space and reach, and the weapons he wields.
Although he uses weapons of the same size as normal, his weapons deal damage as if they were one size category larger, including natural weapons and unarmed strikes.
The benefits of this class feature stack with the effects of spells and abilities that increase the barbarian's size category.

\cf{Bbn}[9th]{Improved Uncanny Dodge}[Ex]
The barbarian reduces his overwhelm penalties by 2.
This does not stack with the effects of uncanny dodge.
If his overwhelm penalty is reduced to 0, he is not considered to be overwhelmed.

\cf{Bbn}[11th]{Chaotic Rage}[Ex]

The barbarian cannot take more than half his maximum hit points in damage during a single round.
Any excess damage is ignored.

\cf{Bbn}[19th]{Deathless Rage}[Ex]

This can prevent him from dying from critical damage.
However, if his critical damage exceeds twice his maximum hit points, the barbarian immediately dies.

\subsubsection{Ex-Barbarians}
A barbarian who becomes lawful loses his ability to rage, and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian.
He retains all his other class features.
If he stops being lawful, he regains his ability to rage and take barbarian levels.

\subsection{Class Features}
All clerics have the following abilities.

\cf{Clr}{Domains}
A cleric chooses two domains, which represent his personal spiritual inclinations.
If he has a deity, he must choose his domains from among those his deity offers.
A cleric's choice of domains has broad effects on the cleric's spellcasting and supernatural abilities.
The domains are listed below.

\begin{itemize}
    \item{Air}
    \item{Chaos}
    \item{Death}

\cf{Clr}{Spells}
A cleric casts divine spells using his devotion.
A cleric's spellpower is normally equal to his divine power.
See the Divine Power and Devotion abilities, below.

The number of spells a cleric knows is given on \trefnp{Cleric Spells Known}.
The cleric may learn spells from both the divine spell list (see \pcref{Divine Spells}) and his domain spell lists (see \pcref{Cleric Domains}).
Sometimes these domain spells are spells that are normally available on the divine spell list, but often they are only accessible by the domain.

The number of spells a cleric can cast per day is given on \trefnp{Cleric Spell Slots}.

In order to regain his spell slots for the day, the cleric must dismiss all his active spells and spend 1 hour performing a ritual, worshipping, or quietly contemplating.
The cleric cannot regain spell slots in this way more than once per day.

A cleric can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to his own or his deity's (if he has one).
Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.

Whenever the cleric is in a natural environment, he gains the natural casting ability, as the druid class feature (see Natural Casting, \pref{Drd:Natural Casting}).
He can use this ability at up to Close range.

\subsubsection{Ex-Clerics}
A cleric who grossly violates the code of conduct required by his god loses all spells and supernatural cleric class features.
He cannot thereafter gain levels as a cleric of that god until he atones (see the \spell{atonement} spell description).

\subsection{Base Class Features}
A character with druid as a base class gains the following abilities.

\classbasics{Skill Points} 10.

\classbasics{Defenses} \plus4 Fortitude, \plus2 Mental.

\cf{Drd}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
Druids are proficient with simple weapons, any one other weapon group, scimitars, sickles, and slings.
In addition, druids are proficient with light armor, medium armor, and shields.
However, a druid cannot use metal armor; see the Metal Abhorrence ability, below.

\cf{Drd}{Natural Casting}[Ex]
Whenever the druid casts a nature spell with an area that originate from her, such as most cone or line spells, she may cause the spell to originate from any location within 10 feet of her.
All other aspects of the spell are unchanged.

For example, a druid casting \spell{burning hands} could create a cone of fire originating from 10 feet to her right.
The cone would extend 20 feet out from that point, as normal.
If the druid directed the cone back towards her, she could potentially be affected by the spell.

At 9th level, this ability's range improves to \rngclose.
At 19th level, this ability's range improves to \rngmed.

\cf{Drd}{Rituals}
Druids can perform rituals to create unique magical effects (see \pcref{Rituals}).
A druid begins play with a ritual book containing one nature ritual of her choice (see \pcref{Nature Rituals}).

\cf{Drd}{Druidic Language}
Druids know Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, in addition to their normal languages.
Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.
Druidic has its own alphabet.

\subsection{Class Features}
All druids have the following abilities.

\cf{Drd}{Metal Abhorrence}
The oaths that druids swear as part of their initiation prohibit them from wearing armor made of metal.
A druid who wears prohibited armor or carries a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.
(A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the \spell{ironwood} ritual so that it functions as though it were steel. See the ritual description.)

\cf{Drd}{Spells}
A druid casts nature spells using her attunement with nature.
A druid's spellpower is normally equal to her nature power.

At 1st level, the druid knows one 1st level spell.
At every level theareafter, she learns one additional spell.
The spell can be of any level, up to a maximum of half the druid's class level.
A druid's spells are drawn from the spells on the nature spell list (see \pcref{Nature Spells}).

Druids have a limit on the number of spells they can cast, as given on \trefnp{Druid Spell Slots}.
Attuning to a natural environment for an hour, as described above, restores all spell slots the druid has expended.

\cf{Drd}{Nature Power}[Su]
The strength of a druid's spells and abilities are determined by her connection to nature.
Normally, her nature power is equal to her druid level.

\cf{Drd}{Attunement}[Su]
Whenever the druid is in a natural environment, she may dismiss all her active spells and spend one hour attuning to the natural world.
If she does so, she regains all her spell slots.

\cf{Drd}[2nd]{Wild Speech}[Su]
The druid learns how to communicate with animals.
As a standard action, the druid can choose a type of animal, such as owl or wolf.
She gains the ability to speak to and understand animals of that type for 5 minutes.
A druid can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Perception or half her druid level, whichever is higher.

This ability doesn't make the animals any more friendly or cooperative than normal.
Furthermore, wary and cunning animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while the more stupid ones make inane comments.
If an animal is friendly toward the druid, she may be able to convince it to do some favor or service.

\cf{Drd}[2nd]{Wild Aspect}[Su]
The druid gains the ability to embody an aspect of an animal.
She chooses one wild aspect from the list below.
Some wild aspects have minimum druid levels, as indicated in the title of the aspect.
At her 4th druid level, and every even druid level thereafter, the druid gains an additional wild aspect.

Unless otherwise noted, embodying a wild aspect is a standard action.
Embodying a wild aspect costs a spell slot of any level.
Once embodied, a wild aspect persists until the druid embodies a new aspect or dismisses the aspect.
If the druid embodies a new wild aspect, the previous aspect ends immediately.
All wild aspects can be dismissed as a swift action.

All wild aspects are supernatural abilities unless otherwise noted.

The descriptions below describe the effects of the aspect.
With many aspects, the druid's appearance also changes to match the aspect, but this is not described.
Different druids change in different ways.
For example, one druid might gain unusually large eyes when embodying the low-light vision aspect, while another might change her irises into slits, like a cat, when embodying the same aspect.
The changes made are up to the druid, but cannot be used to gain an additional substantive benefit beyond the effects given in the description of the aspect.

At 6th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the druid gains the ability to embody an additional wild aspect at the same time.

\subcf{Animal Affinity}
The druid gains a \plus2 bonus to Creature Handling and Ride checks.
\subcf{Armaments of the Bear}
The druid's mouth and hands transform, allowing her to perform bite and claw attacks.
The bite attack deals 1d8 damage for a Medium druid, and the claws deal 1d6 damage.
(See \pcref{Natural Weapons}, for details about natural weapons.)
\subcf{Constrict}
The druid's body transforms, allowing her to perform a constrict attack.
The attack deals 1d10 damage for a Medium druid, but it can only be used against a foe she is grappling with.
(See \pcref{Natural Weapons}, for details about natural weapons).
\subcf{Gore}
The druid's head transforms, allowing it to perform a gore attack.
The attack deals 1d8 damage for a Medium druid.
(See \pcref{Natural Weapons}, for details about natural weapons.)
\subcf{Lope}
The druid gains the ability to move on all four limbs.
When doing so, she increases her speed by 20 feet, but she cannot use her hands for anything except moving.
When not moving on four legs, her ability to use her hands is unchanged.
\subcf{Low-light Vision}
The druid gains low-light vision.
She treats sources of light as if they had double their normal illumination range.
\subcf{Talons}
The druid's feet transform, allowing her to perform a talon attack.
The attack deals 1d6 damage for a Medium druid.
(See \pcref{Natural Weapons}, for details about natural weapons.)
\subcf{Woodland Stride}
The druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.
However, plants magically manipulated to impede motion still affect her.
\subcf{4th -- Bear's Endurance}
The druid gains a \plus2 bonus to Constitution.
This cannot increase her Constitution above her nature power.
\subcf{4th -- Bull's Strength}
The druid gains a \plus2 bonus to Strength.
This cannot increase her Strength above her nature power.
\subcf{4th -- Cat's Grace}
The druid gains a \plus2 bonus to Dexterity.
This cannot increase her Dexterity above her nature power.
\subcf{4th -- Fox's Cunning}
The druid gains a \plus2 bonus to Intelligence.
This cannot increase her Intelligence above her nature power.
\subcf{4th -- Mule's Tenacity}
The druid gains a \plus2 bonus to Willpower.
This cannot increase her Willpower above her nature power.
\subcf{4th -- Owl's Insight}
The druid gains a \plus2 bonus to Perception.
This cannot increase her Perception above her nature power.
\subcf{6th -- Climb}
The druid gains a climb speed equal to her base land speed.
\subcf{6th -- Darkvision}
The druid gains \glossterm{darkvision} out to 50 feet, allowing her to see in complete darkness.
If she already has darkvision, she increases its range by 50 feet.
\subcf{6th -- Enhanced Natural Weapons}
The druid's natural weapons gain a \glossterm{enhancement bonus} equal to one quarter of her nature power.
This functions like an enhancement bonus on a weapon, increasing her damage and offensive legend points per day (see \pcref{Weapon Enhancement Bonuses}).
\subcf{6th -- Glide}
The druid grows wings, granting her a glide speed equal to her land speed.
See \pcref{Gliding}, for more details.
\subcf{6th -- Shrink}
The druid shrinks by a size category.
This functions like the \spell{reduce person} spell.
This is a sizing effect.
\subcf{6th -- Slither}
The druid gains a climb speed equal to half her base land speed.
She does not need to use her hands to climb in this way.
See \pcref{Climbing}, for more details.
\subcf{6th -- Venom Immunity}
The druid gains immunity to all poisons.
\subcf{6th -- Wolfpack}
Overwhelmed foes the druid threatens increase their overwhelm penalties by 1.
\subcf{8th -- Natural Grab}
If the druid hits with a natural attack, she may attempt to grapple her foe as an immediate action.
\subcf{8th -- Natural Knockback}
If the druid hits with a natural attack, she may attempt to shove her foe as an immediate action.
She cannot move with the struck creature to push it back farther.
\subcf{8th -- Natural Trip}
If the druid hits with a natural attack, she may attempt to trip her foe as an immediate action.
See \pcref{Trip}, for more details.
\subcf{8th -- Scent}
The druid gains the scent ability, granting her a \plus10 bonus to scent-based Awareness checks (see \pcref{Awareness}).
\subcf{8th -- Swiftstrike}
The druid's attack speed increases.
When she makes a standard attack, she may make an additional strike.
This strike must be made with a natural weapon.
This effect does not stack with similar effects that grant extra strikes.
\subcf{10th -- Grow}
The druid increases in size by one size category.
This functions as the \spell{enlarge} spell.
This is a sizing effect.
\subcf{10th -- Limited Flight}
The druid grows wings, granting her a fly speed equal to her land speed with average maneuverability.
See \pcref{Flying}, for more details.
She can only fly for a number of rounds equal to 3 \add half her Constitution.
After that limit is reached, she must rest for 5 minutes.
\subcf{10th -- Venom}
When the druid embodies this aspect, she transforms one of her natural weapons to become poisonous.
If she hits with that natural attack, she may inject poison into the struck creature as an immediate action.
At the end of each round, the druid makes a special attack vs. Fortitude against all creatures she has poisoned with this ability.
If the attack succeeds, the creature takes 1d6 physical damage per two druid levels and is \sickened for 5 rounds.
The poison lasts until the druid fails the attack twice.
%TODO poison stacking rules

\cf{Drd}[6th]{Wild Speech (Plants)}[Ex]
The druid can also converse with plants and plant creatures using her wild speech ability.
A regular plant's sense of its surroundings is limited, so it won't be able to give (or recognize) detailed descriptions of creatures or answer questions about events outside its immediate vicinity.

\cf{Drd}[7th]{Charming Wild Speech}[Su]
As a standard action that consumes a use of her wild speech ability, the druid can attempt to charm a creature she is speaking with using her wild speech ability.
If she succeeds at a special attack vs. Mental defense, the target is charmed.
The effect lasts for the duration of the conversation, and for 1 hour thereafter.
This ability is not mind-affecting, and can affect creatures or even objects of any kind that the druid can use her wild speech to converse with.
The attack automatically succeeds against non-intelligent objects.
The druid's accuracy with this ability is equal to her nature power.

A charmed creature or object regards the druid as a trusted friend and ally.
The druid cannot control the subject as if it were an automaton, but it perceives her words and actions in the most favorable way.
She can try to give the subject orders, but she must succeed at a Persuasion check to convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do.
(Retries are not allowed.) Treat the subject as a friend (a \plus10 relationship modifier) for the purpose of the Persuasion check.
An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing.

\cf{Drd}[11th]{Wild Speech (Elements)}[Su]
The druid gains the ability to speak with one of the elements that make up the natural world with her wild speech ability.
When she gains this ability, she chooses whether she can speak with natural air, earth, fire, or water.
That choice cannot thereafter be changed.

\cf{Drd}[12th]{Natural Aspect}[Su]
The druid gains the ability to embody aspects of the natural world, including the elements, in addition to those of animals.
She adds the options below to the list of abilities she can gain with her wild aspect ability.

\begin{comment}

%\subcf{Aerial Combat} The druid gains a \plus2 bonus to physical attacks while either she or her target is airborne.
%\subcf{Aquatic Combat} The druid gains a \plus2 bonus to physical attacks while both she and her target are touching naturally occuring water (including rain, but not fog or ice).

%\subcf{Earthen Combat} The druid gains a \plus2 bonus to physical attacks with melee attacks while both she and her target are touching natural earth or stone.
%\subcf{Fiery Combat} The druid gains a \plus2 bonus to physical attacks while she or her target is ignited.
%\subcf{Earthen Might} The druid gains a \plus2 bonus to caster level while she is touching natural earth or stone.
\subcf{Heart of Air} The druid can breathe in any environment, and is immune to \spell{sickening cloud}
and similar effects.
In addition, she falls at half speed and takes no falling damage.
\subcf{Heart of Earth} The druid gains the effects of the \spell{stoneskin}
spell, with a spellpower equal to her druid level or Constitution.
\subcf{Heart of Fire} The druid gains the effects of the warm version of the \spell{fire shield}
spell, with a spellpower equal to her druid level or Constitution.
\subcf{Heart of the Sun}
The druid constantly radiates bright light out to a 100 foot radius (and shadowy illumination for an additional 100 feet).
The illumination is so bright that she becomes hard to look at.
Any creature attacking her from within the radius of bright light becomes dazzled for 5 rounds after the attack.
\subcf{Heart of Oak} The druid gains the effects of the \spell{stoneskin}
spell, with a spellpower equal to her druid level or Constitution, except that the damage reduction is overcome by fire instead of adamantine weapons.
\subcf{Heart of Water} The druid gains the effects of the \spell{freedom}
spell.
\subcf{15th -- Air Mantle}
 The druid is surrounded by a mantle of air.
Thrown and projectile weapons have a 50\% chance to miss her while this effect is active.
Unusually large weapons, such as a giant's boulders, may suffer a decreased miss chance as appropriate to their size.
\subcf{15th -- Aqueous Step}
 Wherever the druid moves, she leaves a path of animated water that can grab creatures.
Whenever a creature crosses the path, the druid makes a Reflex attack to trip the creature, causing it to fall prone and waste the rest of its movement.
Her accuracy is equal to her druid level \add her Constitution.
\subcf{15th -- Flaming Step}
Wherever the druid moves, she leaves a path of burning flame behind her that lasts for 1 round.
Whenever a creature crosses the path, the druid makes a Reflex attack to deal damage to the creature.
The attack deals 1d6 points of fire damage per two druid levels.
Her accuracy is equal to her druid level \add her Constitution.
A failed attack deals half damage.
\subcf{15th -- Lifegiving Step}
Wherever the druid moves, she leaves a path of small, living plants that entangle foes for 1 round.
Whenever a creature crosses the path, the druid makes a Reflex attack to entangle the creature, causing it to waste the rest of its movement.
Her accuracy is equal to her druid level \add her Constitution.
The plants appear on any surface, and will continue to grow if they can survive, though they may die quickly if they appear on inhospitable terrain.
\subcf{17th -- Flight}
The druid gains a fly speed equal to her land speed, with good maneuverability.
She may remain flying for up to 5 rounds at a time.
After that, she must land for 1 round before she can fly again.
See \pcref{Flying}, for more details.
\subcf{17th -- Flaming Soul}
The druid gains the fire subtype, making her immune to fire but giving her a 50\% vulnerability to cold damage.
In addition, whenever she deals fire damage to a creature, the creature is \ignited for 5 rounds.
\subcf{17th -- Sunblessed Rejuvenation}
The druid gains fast healing equal to her druid level as long as she remains in sunlight or touches a plant of her size or larger.
\subcf{17th -- Sunscour}
This aspect functions like the heart of the sun natural aspect, except that it also suppresses shadow effects and the visual components of illusions within the area of bright light.

\subcf{17th -- Water's Flow}
As a swift action, the druid can transform herself into a rushing flow of water with a volume roughly equal to her normal volume until the end of her turn.
In this form, she may move wherever water could go, but she cannot take other actions, such as jumping, attacking, or casting spells.
Her speed is halved when moving uphill and doubled when moving downhill.
She may move through squares occupied by creatures or threatened by blocking enemies without penalty.
She may return to her normal form as a free action.
\par If the water is split, she may reform from anywhere the water has reached, to as little as a single ounce of water.
If not even an ounce of water exists contiguously, her body reforms from the largest available parts of water, cut into pieces of appropriate size.
This usually causes the druid to die.

\end{comment}

\cf{Drd}[13th]{A Thousand Faces}[Su] The druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the \spell{disguise self}
spell.
This affects the druid's body, but not her possessions.
It is not an illusory effect, but a minor physical alteration of the druid's appearance, within the limits described for the spell.

\cf{Drd}[15th]{Timeless Body}[Ex]
The druid no longer takes attribute penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged.
Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place.
Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.

\cf{Drd}[17th]{Dominating Wild Speech}[Ex]
When the druid uses her charming wild speech ability, she can dominate the subject (as the \spell{dominate person}
spell) instead of charming it.
This ability is not mind-affecting, and can affect creatures of any kind that the druid can converse with.
The attack automatically succeeds against non-intelligent objects.

\subsection{Ex-Druids}
A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and supernatural druid class features.
She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the \spell{atonement} ritual).

\subsection{Variant Druids}

\subsubsection{Blighter}

Blighters draw power from nature, as do other druids. However, while other druids revere nature and draw power from it gently, blighters steal power from nature forcefully. Wherever a blighter goes, destruction and death surely follows.

\altcf{Attunement} As normal, except that when a blighter attunes to a natural environment, the terrain within a 100 foot radius is blighted.
This has several effects, all of which slowly take place over the course of the attunement process.
Every living thing in the area other than the blighter takes damage equal to the blighter's level once per ten minutes.
All inanimate plants of Huge size or smaller wither and die.
The earth becomes cracked and infertile, and any nutrients from the soil are destroyed.
This ability has no effect on artificial environments or materials, such as metal or worked stone.

In addition, the blighter's bonus to spellpower from attuning lasts for 1 hour, regardless of whether she is in a natural environment.

\altcf{Spells} As normal, except that a blighter adds all general Vivimancy arcane spells to her spell list.

\altcf[2nd]{Wild Speech} As normal, except that a blighter gains a \plus5 bonus to Intimidate against her wild speech targets, and a \minus5 penalty to Persuasion.

\altcf{Natural Casting} The blighter does not gain this ability.

\altcf[10th]{Blightcasting}

\altcf[20th]{Improved Blightcasting}

\subsubsection{Rotbringer}

While most druids seek to emulate and interact with animals, rotbringers focus on the power of fungi, decay, and regeneration.

\altcf{Attunement} As normal, except that when a rotbringer attunes to a natural environment, the terrain within a 100 foot radius decomposes.
This has several effects, all of which slowly take place over the course of the attunement process.
All organic objects of Huge size or smaller, such as plants and corpses, decompose.
This decomposition kills living plants.
All organic objects, regardless of size, are covered with various fungi.
This ability has no effect on artificial environments or materials, such as metal or worked stone.

If the rotbringer decomposes a Huge object while attuning, or a combination of smaller objects equivalent in size to a Huge object, she gains an bonus spell slot of her highest available spell level.
This extra spell slot lasts until it is used, or until the druid attunes again.

\altcf[2nd]{Wild Speech} The rotbringer gains the ability to speak with plants at 2nd level.
She gains the ability to speak with animals at 6th level, instead of at 2nd level.

\altcf[3rd]{Wild Aspect} The rotbringer does not gain this ability.

\altcf[3rd]{Rot Spell} The druid learns an additional spell slot and spell known.
The spell must be taken from the following list of spells.
The spell's level cannot exceed half her druid level.
If she already knows a spell from the list at every spell level she has access to, she may instead learn any nature spell (see \pcref{Nature Spells}).

At 5th level, and every odd level, the druid may learn a new spell.

\subsection{Base Class Features}
A character with fighter as a base class gains the following abilities.

\classbasics{Skill Points} 10.

\classbasics{Defenses} \plus4 Fortitude, \plus2 Mental.

\cf{Ftr}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
 A fighter is proficient with simple weapons, any four other weapon groups,  all armor (heavy, medium, and light), and shields.

\cf{Ftr}{Advanced Training}[Ex]
A fighter treats his combat prowess as if it were 2 points higher than it actually is for the purpose of meeting feat prerequisites.

\subsection{Class Features}
All fighters have the following abilities.

\cf{Ftr}{Armor Discipline}
A fighter's training grants him additional capability in armor.
He must choose to improve his agility or his resilience in armor.
This applies to all armor discipline abilities the fighter has.
If he improves his agility, he reduces his armor check penalty by 2 and reduces his arcane spell failure by 5\% while wearing body armor.
If he improves his resilience, he gains a \plus1 bonus to Armor defense while wearing body armor.

\cf{Ftr}[2nd]{Bonus Feat}
The fighter gets a bonus combat-oriented feat.
This bonus feat must be drawn from the feats noted as combat feats on \tref{Combat Feats}.
A fighter must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including attribute and combat prowess minimums.
The fighter gains an additional bonus feat at his 6th fighter level and every four fighter levels thereafter (6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th).

\cf{Ftr}[3rd]{Weapon Discipline}
The fighter's training grants him additional capability when using his weapons.
He may choose a weapon group, or he may choose to train equally with all weapons.
If he chooses a weapon group, he gains a \plus1 bonus to accuracy with weapons from that group.

If he chooses not to focus on a specific group of weapons, he gains the ability to become proficient with any weapon group if he spends 1 hour training with a weapon from that group.
He may only keep this proficiency with one weapon group at a time; if he trains with a new weapon group, he loses his proficiency in the previous group.

\cf{Ftr}[4th]{Adaptive Combat Feats}
The fighter gains a flexible bonus feat which he can change periodically.
The fighter chooses a number of combat feats equal to half his fighter level or half his Intelligence, whichever is higher.
These feats comprise his adaptive feat pool.
The fighter gains one of the feats from his adaptive feat pool as a bonus feat.
By training for an hour, the fighter can change his current adapative combat feat to one of the other feats in his adaptive style feat pool.
He must meet the prerequisites for the new feat.

\par An adaptive style feat may be used normally as prerequisites for other feats or abilities.
However, if an adaptive style feat is used as a prerequisite, it cannot be changed until the fighter no longer needs to use it as a prerequisite, such as might happen if the fighter takes the feat as a normal feat or bonus feat.

\par In order to gain an adaptive style feat, it must be reasonably possible to do training related to the new feat.
For example, a fighter could not gain Weapon Focus in axes without at least one axe available to train with.

The fighter gains an additional adaptive combat feat at his 8th fighter level and every four fighter levels thereafter (8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th).
He may change all of his adaptive combat feats at once when he trains.

\cf{Ftr}[5th]{Combat Discipline}
The fighter can use his superior training and focus to keep fighting in the face of debilitating effects.
When a fighter is initially affected by one of the conditions listed on \trefnp{Combat Discipline Conditions}, he may use his combat discipline ability to instead suffer the mitigated condition one column to the right.
He can suppress the condition up to 5 rounds.

\par Using combat discipline takes no action, and can be done at any time, even when it isn't the fighter's turn.
A fighter may use this ability a number of times per day equal to his Willpower or half his fighter level, whichever is higher.
However, he cannot mitigate more than one condition at a time.
If the fighter attempts to mitigate a new condition, the old condition resumes its normal effect immediately.

    1.  Mitigate up to half fighter level or half Constitution, whichever is greater. \\
    2.  Mitigates the impairment, but does not prevent the fighter from taking d6 fire damage per round until the fire is put out.  \\
    3.  Mitigate a single negative level. \\
\end{dtable}

\par A fighter can never use this ability more than once against a single source.
For example, if a fighter is confused by a \spell{confusion} spell, he can use this ability to become disoriented instead of confused, but he can't then expend a second use to stop being disoriented.
The lesser condition that this ability imposes may be cured or removed normally, but doing so does not affect the resurgence of the condition the fighter was originally afflicted with.
If a fighter uses this ability to mitigate or negate a condition which he must suffer as a sacrifice or cost to gain some benefit, he automatically forfeits the benefit he would have gained.

\cf{Ftr}[7th]{Improved Armor Discipline}
The fighter's training with his armor improves.
If he chose agility, he reduces his armor check penalty by 4 and decreases his arcane spell failure by 15\%.
This does not stack with the effects of armor discipline.
In addition, he treats all body armor as if it were one encumbrance category lighter than it is.
\par This ability means heavy armor is treated as medium armor, medium armor is treated as light armor, and light armor is treated as being unarmored.
This can remove the halving of the fighter's Dexterity bonus, if appropriate for the new encumbrance of the fighter's armor.
This allows the fighter to qualify for class features using the reduced armor encumbrance category.
For example, a fighter 9 / wizard 2 who reduces his encumbrance in light armor could cast spells without any arcane spell failure in light armor.

If the fighter chose resilience, he gains damage reduction against physical damage equal to his fighter level. This allows him to ignore the first points of damage he would take each round.

\cf{Ftr}[9th]{Improved Weapon Discipline}
The fighter's training in his chosen weapons improves.
He gains a \plus4 bonus to resist disarm attempts against using his chosen weapons.
If he chose a specific weapon group, he gains a \plus2 bonus to accuracy with weapons from that group.
This does not stack with effects of weapon discipline.
If he did not, he can apply all weapon group-specific feats he has to any weapon group that he trains with for 1 hour.
He retains this benefit for one week after the training.

\cf{Ftr}[10th]{Battlemaster}
The fighter can improve his allies' combat abilities.
As a standard action, he may grant the use of one of his combat feats to allies within \rngmed range of him who can see and hear him.
He can affect a number of allies equal to half his Intelligence (minimum 1).
Affected allies must meet combat prowess prerequisites for the granted feat, but they can ignore all other prerequisites.
The effect lasts as long as the fighter spends a standard action to maintain the effect, and for 5 rounds thereafter.
The fighter can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his Intelligence or half his fighter level, whichever is higher.

\cf{Ftr}[11th]{Improved Combat Discipline}
The fighter's ability to keep fighting despite negative influence improves.
He can reduce conditions by two steps instead of one when using combat discipline.
For example, a stunned fighter who used combat discipline would instead be staggered.
\par In addition, a fighter may use combat discipline to reduce any penalties he suffers to his accuracy, damage, checks, or defenses by 2, even if the source of the penalty is not listed on the combat discipline chart.
\par The fighter may also mitigate up to two conditions at once.

\cf{Ftr}[13th]{Greater Armor Discipline}
The fighter's training in his chosen armor becomes still greater.
If he chose agility, he reduces his armor check penalty by 6 and decreases his arcane spell failure by 30\% while wearing armor of any kind.
In addition, he treats all armor as if it were two encumbrance categories lighter than it actually is whenever doing so would be beneficial to him.
This does not stack with the benefits of armor discipline or improved armor discipline.

If the fighter chose resilience, he may apply his damage reduction against all damage, including from magical attacks.

\cf{Ftr}[14th]{Improved Adaptive Combat}
The fighter's ability to adapt to situations improves.
He need only spend 1 minute training to change his adaptive combat feats.

\cf{Ftr}[15th]{Greater Weapon Discipline}
The fighter's training in his chosen weapons becomes still greater.
He increases the \glossterm{critical range} of his chosen weapons by 1.
This increase stacks with any other effects that affect critical range.
Thus, a fighter using the Heartseeker combat style (see \featpcref{Heartseeker}) would have a critical range of 18-20.

\cf{Ftr}[17th]{Greater Combat Discipline}
The fighter's ability to keep fighting despite influence becomes still greater.
When using combat discipline, he may ignore any condition listed on the combat discipline chart.
In addition, he may use combat discipline to be \severelyimpaired with all actions rather than suffer any non-damaging condition not listed on the chart.

\par The fighter may also mitigate up to three conditions at once.

\cf{Ftr}[18th]{Improved Battlemaster}
The fighter can improve his allies' combat abilities more effectively.
When using his battlemaster ability, he can grant two feats at once.
In addition, he can use his battlemaster ability as a swift action.

\cf{Ftr}[19th]{True Discipline}
The fighter's discipline in his chosen area is beyond equal.
He must choose either weapon discipline, armor discipline, or combat discipline.
Depending on which discipline he chooses, he gains a different bonus.
\subcf{True Weapon Discipline}
When the fighter makes a standard attack, he can make an additional strike.
This does not stack with any other effects which grant extra strikes.
\subcf{True Armor Discipline}
If the fighter chose agility, he no longer suffers armor check penalties or arcane spell failure with any armor.
He ignores the encumbrance of all armor, causing him to be treated as unarmored whenever doing so is beneficial to him.
In addition, he applies the defense bonus from any body armor he wears to his Reflex defense.

If the fighter chose resilience, he may apply his Constutition to his Reflex defense in place of his Dexterity while wearing armor of any kind.
In addition, he applies the defense bonus from any body armor he wears to his Fortitude defense.
\subcf{True Combat Discipline}
The fighter can use combat discipline to be \impaired with all actions instead of suffering any nondamaging negative effect with a duration.
He may also mitigate up to four conditions at once.

\cf{Ftr}[20th]{Greater Adaptive Combat}
The fighter's ability to react to situations is unparalleled.
As a swift action, he can exchange a single adaptive combat feat from his adapative feat pool.

A character with monk as a base class gains the following abilities.

\classbasics{Skill Points} 10.

\classbasics{Defenses} \plus2 Fortitude, \plus4 Reflex, \plus4 Mental.

\cf{Mnk}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
Monks are proficient with simple weapons, monk weapons, and any one other weapon group.
Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields.
When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses the benefit of her enlightened defense, fast movement, and \ki abilities.

\cf{Mnk}{Ki Strike} A monk's fists, and all weapons she uses, gain a \plus1 \glossterm{enhancement bonus}.
This bonus increases by \plus1 at 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter.
This functions like an enhancement bonus on a weapon, increasing her damage and offensive legend points per day (see \pcref{Weapon Enhancement Bonuses}).

\subsection{Class Features}
All monks have the following abilities.

\cf{Mnk}{Enlightened Defense}[Ex]
A monk's \ki shields her body from attacks.
When \monkunencumbered, she gains a \plus2 bonus to Armor defense.
She loses this bonus when she is helpless.

\cf{Mnk}{Ki Power}[Su]
Many monk abilities depend on her \ki power.
A monk's \ki power is equal to her Willpower or her monk level, whichever is higher.

\cf{Mnk}{Unarmed Warrior}[Ex]
A monk's unarmed attacks are exceptionally deadly.
She gains the Improved Unarmed Strike feat as a bonus feat.
In addition, she deals damage with her unarmed strikes as if she were two size categories larger than her actual size (1d6 for a Medium creature, or 1d4 for a small creature).
For details about how to fight while unarmed, see \pcref{Unarmed Combat}.

\cf{Mnk}[2nd]{Manifest Ki}[Su]
The monk gains the ability to channel her \ki energy to temporarily enhance her abilities.
This ability can be used a number of times per day equal to her Willpower or half her monk level, whichever is higher.

She chooses one \ki manifestation from the list below.
Some \ki manifestations have minimum monk levels, as indicated in the title of the power.
At her 5th monk level, and every three monk levels thereafter, the monk learns an additional \ki manifestation.

Some \ki manifestations function like spells.
Unless otherwise noted, the monk's effective spellpower with these abilities is equal to her \ki power.
All \ki manifestations are supernatural abilities unless otherwise noted.

\subcf{Distant Blows}
As a swift action, the monk can empower her unarmed attacks with \ki, allowing her to strike distant foes.
Until the end of the round, she gains an additional five feet of reach with her unarmed attacks, extending her threatened area.
\subcf{Slow Fall}
As an immediate action, the monk can gain the benefits of the \spell{feather fall} spell.
She must be within reach of a solid object to use this ability.
\subcf{Surpass Limits}
As a swift action, the monk can surpass the physical limitations of her body.
Until the start of her next turn, she may use her \ki power in place of her Strength or Dexterity when making skill and ability checks.
\subcf{Wholeness of Body}
As a standard action, the monk can correct the flow of energy within her body.
She heals hit points equal to half her \ki power in d10s.
\subcf{5th -- Resist Energy}

\subcf{5th -- Speed Boost}
As a swift action, the monk can gain the benefits of the \spell{lesser haste} spell for 1 round.
\subcf{5th -- Stunning Fist}
As a swift action, the monk can imbue the next unarmed attack she makes that round with the ability to disrupt her foe's \ki.
If the attack deals damage, the monk makes a special attack against the Fortitude of the struck creature.
Her accuracy is equal to her \ki power.
Success means the target is \staggered for 1 round.
A critical success means the target is \stunned for 1 round instead.
\norepeatnotes
\subcf{8th -- Rapid Step}
As a move action, the monk can move up to her speed.
She cannot be followed or withdrawn from during this movement.
\subcf{8th -- Redirect Attack}
As an immediate action, when a foe misses the monk with a melee attack, the monk can redirect the attack.
Both the foe and the monk must threaten a third creature.
If the monk redirects the attack, the foe rolls the same attack against the third creature.
\subcf{11th -- Diamond Fists}
As a swift action, the monk can empower her unarmed attacks with incredible force.
Until the end of the round, she may use her \ki power in place of her normal modifiers to physical damage with her unarmed attacks.
In addition, she treats her unarmed strike as if it were an adamantine weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and hardness.
\subcf{11th -- Flash Step}
As a move action, the monk can slip between spaces, allowing her to teleport to anywhere she can see within 30 feet.
If her line of effect is blocked, even by an invisible barrier, or if this would somehow place her inside a solid object, the ability fails.
\subcf{14th -- Empty Step} As a swift action, the monk can step into the Ethereal Plane until the end of her turn, as the \spell{ethereal jaunt}
spell.
She may return as a free action.
\subcf{14th -- Quivering Palm}
As a standard action, the monk can make a single unarmed strike.
If the attack deals damage, the struck creature is \sickened by the disruption of the \ki within in its body for 5 rounds.
At any point during that time, the monk can will the struck target to die (a free action).
If she does, and the creature is \bloodied, she makes a special attack vs. Fortitude.
If the attack succeeds, the creature loses all its hit points and takes critical damage equal to her monk level, causing it to begin dying (see \pcref{Dying}).
\subcf{17th -- Moment of Perfection}
The monk can align herself with the universe to achieve a single moment of perfection.
As a swift action, she can add her monk level as an bonus to any single physical attack or opposed check.
Alternately, when she is physically attacked, she can use an immediate action to add her monk level to her physical defenses against the attack.
After using this ability, she must wait five minutes before she can use it again.
\subcf{17th -- Empty Body} As a move action, the monk can step into the Ethereal Plane for 5 rounds, as the \spell{ethereal jaunt}
spell.
For the duration of the effect, she may switch between the planes as a move action.

\cf{Mnk}[3rd]{Evasion}[Ex]
If the monk resists a Reflex attack that normally deals half damage when resisted, she instead takes no damage.
Evasion can be used only if a monk is \unencumbered.
A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.

\cf{Mnk}[3rd]{Uncanny Dodge}[Ex]
The monk can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so.
The monk reduces her overwhelm penalties by 1.
If her overwhelm penalty is reduced to 0, she is not considered to be overwhelmed.
In addition, she is not \unaware when attacked by surprise.

\cf{Mnk}[4th]{Flurry of Blows}
When attacking unarmed, the monk can attack with multiple parts of her body simultaneously.
This allows her gain the benefits of dual wielding with her unarmed strike (see \pcref{Dual Wielding}).

%\cf{Mnk}[5th]{Still Mind}{Ex} The monk may add half her Perception to he]
%cf defense in place of half her Intelligence]
%If she has an Intelligence penalty, that penalty still applies.

\cf{Mnk}[6th]{Ki Augmentation}[Su]
The monk's control over her \ki improves, allowing her to permanently improve her abilities.

The monk becomes immune to hostile mind-affecting effects.

\cf{Mnk}[19th]{Greater Bodily Perfection}
The bonus granted by the monk's bodily perfection ability increases to \plus3.

In addition, she is treated as an outsider rather than as a humanoid for the purpose of spells and magical effects whenever doing so is advantageous to her.

\subsubsection{Ex-Monks}
A monk who becomes chaotic loses her \ki powers, and cannot gain more levels as a monk.
She retains all her other class features.
If she stops being chaotic, she regains her \ki powers and ability to take monk levels.

\cf{Pal}[9th]{Pass Judgment}[Su]
The paladin gains the ability to pass judgment on those she deems unworthy.
Once per day as a swift action, she may pass judgment on a creature within 100 feet of her.
For the purpose of spells and effects, the creature is treated as if it had the alignment opposed to the paladin's devoted alignment.
This effect lasts for one day per paladin level, or until the paladin changes her mind about the subject.
This does not change the creature's actions or behavior, but the creature is subject to the paladin's smite attack, would detect as that alignment under the inspection of a \spell{detect alignment} spell, and so on.

No attack is required for this effect, and it cannot be dispelled, but a \spell{remove curse}, \spell{miracle}, or \spell{wish} spell can remove it.
The paladin can use this ability an additional time per day at her 10th paladin level and every third level thereafter.
A paladin should be careful when using this ability, as persecution of allies can lead overzealous paladins to fall.

\cf{Pal}[17th]{Martyr's Glorious Retribution}[Su]
If the paladin dies in the devoted service of her devoted alignment, she may choose to have her fallen body erupt in an immense burst of divine energy.
If she does, her body is almost completely consumed, preventing her from being raised with \spell{lesser resurrection} and similar effects that require an intact body.
This burst has two effects.
First, a \spell{sunburst} spell immediately takes effect over the area where the paladin fell.
Second, a \spell{storm of vengeance} spell begins to take effect, centered on the same area.
The spell lasts for 10 rounds, and the lightning strikes target the paladin's enemies.
Both of these effects harm only the paladin's foes, and do not harm her allies.
However, her allies' vision is still impeded by the \spell{storm of vengeance}.

\subsubsection{Ex-Paladins}
A paladin who ceases to follow her devoted alignment loses all supernatural paladin class features.
She may not gain any additional paladin levels.
She regains her abilities and advancement potential if she atones for her violations (see the \spell{atonement} ritual), as appropriate.

The ranger adds his quarry bonus to his defenses against attacks that his quarry makes.
See the Quarry ability, below, for details.

\subsection{Class Features}
All rangers have the following abilities.

\cf{Rgr}{Quarry}[Ex]
As a swift action, a ranger may designate any foe he sees as his quarry.
A ranger gains a \plus2 bonus to damage with physical attacks and Awareness, Stealth, and Survival checks against his quarry.
However, while a ranger has designated a quarry, he takes a \minus2 penalty on the same rolls against any target other than his quarry.

A ranger may not normally have more than one quarry at once.
He may not designate a new quarry until he defeats his old quarry, or until he gives up on the quarry.
He may give up pursuing a quarry as a free action.
If he does, he is unable to designate a new quarry until he rests for 5 minutes.

Some special abilities allow the ranger to designate multiple creatures as a quarry.
Abilities which designate multiple creatures as a quarry always last for a specific amount of time.

If the ranger does not see his quarry for more than a week, it is no longer considered his quarry.

\par The amount by which a ranger's damage and skill checks increase against his quarry is called his quarry bonus.
The ranger's quarry bonus improves by \plus1 at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter.
His penalties against targets other than his quarry remains the same.

\cf{Rgr}{Track}

Evasion can be used only if a ranger is \unencumbered.
A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.

\subcf{Favored Enemy}
The ranger increases his quarry bonus by \plus2 against creatures of a particular kind.
The possible creature options are listed on \trefnp{Favored Enemy Options}.

\begin{dtable}
    \lcaption{Favored Enemy Options}

    \end{dtabularx}
\end{dtable}

\subcf{Rapid Healing}

The ranger gains a Survival-based feat for which he qualifies as a bonus feat.

\subcf{Undead Destroyer}

\subcf{9th -- Mageslayer}
The ranger may designate arcane spellcasters as a quarry.
If he does, he gains his quarry bonus against all arcane spellcasters for 5 minutes.
In addition, he gains spell resistance against arcane spells equal to 10 \add his lore power.

To affect the ranger with a spell, a caster must make an attack with an accuracy equal to its spellpower.
If the attack beats the ranger's spell resistance, the spell works normally.
Otherwise, the spell has no effect on the ranger.

\subcf{9th -- Master of the Hunt}
The ranger may use a standard action to share the benefits of his quarry ability with all allies who can see and hear him for 5 rounds.
His allies do not suffer penalties against targets other than the quarry.

The ranger must have the evasion lore to choose this lore.

\subcf{12th -- Wild Aspect}
The ranger chooses any wild aspect from the list of wild aspects available to druids (see \pcref[Drd:Wild Aspect]{Wild Aspect}).
He continuously gains the benefits of that aspect.

He chooses one kind of terrain to select as a favored terrain from the list below.
Usually, rangers favor their home terrain, but a ranger may choose any kind of terrain that he has personally experienced at least once.
At his 7th ranger level, and every four ranger levels thereafter, the ranger gains an additional favored terrain.

\par While in a favored terrain, a ranger gains a \plus2 bonus to Awareness, Stealth, and Survival checks.
If he desires, he may leave no trace of his passage, causing attempts to track him to take a \minus20 penalty.
In addition, his experience with his favored terrain grants the ranger a single ability, regardless of whether he is currently in that terrain or not.
The options for favored terrains are listed below.
\subcf{Aquatic}
The ranger gains Skill Focus (Swim) as a bonus feat, and halves the penalties he takes for fighting underwater.
\subcf{Cold}
The ranger gains cold damage reduction equal to twice his ranger level.
This allows him to ignore the first points of cold damage he would take each round.
\subcf{Desert}

This allows him to ignore the first points of fire damage he would take each round.
\subcf{Forest}

A ranger can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his Perception or half his ranger level, whichever is higher.

\cf{Rgr}[4th]{Low-light Vision}[Ex]
The ranger's sight improves, allowing him to see in conditions of dim light more easily.
He gains low-light vision, allowing him to treat sources of light as if they had double their normal illumination range.
If he already has low-light vision, he doubles its benefit, allowing him to treat sources of light as if they had four times their normal illumination range.

\cf{Rgr}[4th]{Tracking Expert}[Ex]
The ranger's ability to track his foes improves.
He may always take 10 on Survival checks made to track, even if conditions would otherwise prevent this.
Additionally, he can move at his normal speed while following tracks without taking the normal \minus5 penalty.
He takes only a \minus10 penalty (instead of the normal \minus20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.

\cf{Rgr}[6th]{Free Stride}[Ex]
The ranger can move through any sort of natural terrain that slows or impedes movement at his normal speed without suffering any sort of impairment.
If a skill check, such as Climb or Swim, would normally be required to move through the terrain, this ability does not help.

\cf{Rgr}[7th]{Guide}[Ex]
Whenever the ranger is in his favored terrain, all allies that can see and hear the ranger gain his favored terrain bonuses in that terrain as well.

\cf{Rgr}[8th]{Darkvision}[Ex]

If he already has darkvision, he increases its range by 50 feet.

\cf{Rgr}[11th]{Favored Terrain (Planar)}[Ex]
The ranger may choose any plane as a favored terrain in addition to his normal options whenever he gains a new favored terrain.
He is immune to any hostile planar effects from any plane he has chosen as favored terrain.
In addition, he gains a \plus2 bonus to Knowledge checks relating to the plane and is always treated as trained in Knowledge (planar) for the purpose of such checks.

\cf{Rgr}[9th]{Hidden Hunter}[Su]
The ranger becomes even more difficult for his quarry to detect.
He adds his quarry bonus to his Stealth checks against his quarry.
In addition, he continuously benefits from the effect of the \spell{nondectection} spell against all attempts that his quarry makes to detect him magically.
The effect uses a spellpower equal to his ranger level or Perception, whichever is higher.

\cf{Rgr}[12th]{Blindsense}[Ex]
The ranger's perceptions are so finely honed that he can sense his enemies without seeing them.
He gains the blindsense ability out to 50 feet.
This ability allows him to sense the presence and location of objects and foes within 50 feet without seeing them.
If he already has the blindsense ability, he increases its range by 50 feet.

\cf{Rgr}[13th]{Terrain Mastery}[Ex]
The ranger gains a greater degree of mastery over some of his favored terrains.
He chooses a single kind of terrain that he has already chosen as a favored terrain.
At his 17th ranger level, he chooses an additional kind of terrain to master.
\par While in that terrain, his bonuses on Awareness, Stealth, and Survival checks increase to \plus4.
In addition, he gains another ability based on that terrain that is constantly active, whether or not he is currently in the terrain.

Once per day, the ranger may concentrate for a full round to duplicate the effects of the \spell{discern location} ritual targeted at his quarry.

\cf{Rgr}[16th]{Blindsight}[Ex]
The ranger gains the ability to ``see'' perfectly without his eyes in a 50 foot radius around him.

If he already has the blindsight ability, he increases its range by 50 feet.

\cf{Rgr}[18th]{Hide in Plain Sight}[Ex]
While in any of his favored terrains, the ranger can use the Stealth skill to hide even while being observed, taking a \minus5 penalty to the Stealth check.
He still needs cover or concealment to hide.

If the ranger has the Camouflage ranger lore (see \pcref{Camouflage}), this allows the ranger to attempt to hide in almost any situation, as long as he is in one of his favored terrains.

\cf{Rgr}[19th]{Perfect Stride}[Su]
The ranger's ability to surpass obstacles becomes unparalleled.
He constantly acts as if he were under the effect of a \spell{freedom} spell, except that it does not allow him to act normally underwater.

\cf{Rgr}[20th]{Truesight}[Su]
The ranger's perceptions are accurate enough to defeat even powerful magic.
He gains the ability to see all things as they actually are, as the \spell{true seeing} spell, out to a range of 50 feet.

\cf{Rog}{Sneak Attack}
If a rogue can catch an opponent when it is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.
She can choose to deal 1d6 points of extra damage if the target is unaware or is suffering overwhelm penalties from being surrounded by enemies (see \pcref{Overwhelm}).

The extra damage increases by 1d6 at her 3rd rogue level and every two rogue levels thereafter.

\par Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.

With a sap (blackjack) or an unarmed strike, a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage.
She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual \minus4 penalty.

A rogue can only sneak attack creatures with a discernible body structure -- oozes, incorporeal creatures, and some plants lack vital areas to attack.
Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks.
The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot.
A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach.

\cf{Rog}[2nd]{Skill Talent}[Ex]

\subcf{7th -- Defensive Roll}
As an immediate action, whenever the rogue takes damage from a physical attack, she can attempt to roll with the blow.
If the damage dealt is less than her Reflex defense, she takes half damage from the attack, and the damage is nonlethal.
This applies after all other effects that reduce damage, such as damage reduction.
However, the rogue also falls \prone.
The rogue must be aware of the attack to use this ability.

\subcf{7th -- Slippery Mind}
Whenever an attack for a Mind spell or effect beats the rogue's Mental defense by less than 5, she is affected normally at first.
One round later, the rogue is instead affected as if the attack had failed.
This does not help against instantaneous effects.

\subcf{11th -- Improved Evasion}
If the rogue resists an attack against her Reflex defense, she ignores all effects of the attack, even if it would normally have effects on a miss.
Like evasion, improved evasion can be used only if a rogue is \unencumbered.
A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.
The rogue must have the evasion survival trick to choose this survival trick.

\subcf{11th -- Improved Uncanny Dodge}
The rogue reduces her overwhelm penalties by 2.
This does not stack with the effects of uncanny dodge.
If her overwhelm penalty is reduced to 0, she is not considered to be overwhelmed.

\cf{Rog}[4th]{Combat Tricks}
The rogue gains a combat trick to aid her and confound her foes.
She chooses a single combat trick from the list below.
Some combat tricks have minimum rogue levels, as indicated in the title of the ability.

Some combat tricks depend on a rogue's trick power.
A rogue's trick power is equal to her Intelligence or her rogue level, whichever is higher.

The rogue's spellpower for this ability is equal to her trick power.

\subcf{8th -- Staggering Ambush*}

Her accuracy is equal to her trick power.
If the special attack succeeds, the struck creature is \staggered for 5 rounds.

\subcf{12th -- Assassination}
To use this ability, the rogue must spend a full round studying a creature within 100 feet of her who has not noticed her and who is not in combat.

If the target becomes aware of her presence before she attacks, this ability has no benefit.

\subcf{12th -- Confusing Ambush*}
The rogue makes a special attack against the Mental defense of the creature struck by this ambush attack.

Her accuracy is equal to her trick power.
If the special attack succeeds, the struck creature is \staggered for 5 rounds.
If it critically succeeds, the struck creature is \paralyzed for 5 rounds.

%\subcf{16th -- Opportunist} Once per round, the rogue can make an attack of opportunity against a creature that has just taken physical damage from another creature's attack.
%This attack counts as one of the rogue's attacks of opportunity for that round.

\subcf{20th -- Dual Ambush}
The rogue can apply the benefits of two ambush attacks to a single sneak attack.

\subcf{20th -- Lingering Ambush}
The effects of the rogue's ambush attacks last ten times longer than normal.

\classbasics{Alignment} Any.

\classbasics{Class Skills}
\subparhead{Intelligence} Knowledge (arcana, the planes).
\subparhead{Perception} Spellcraft.
\subparhead{Other} Bluff, Intimidate, Persuasion.

\subsection{Base Class Features}
A character with sorcerer as a base class gains the following abilities.

\classbasics{Skill Points} 5.

\classbasics{Defenses} \plus4 Mental.

\cf{Sor}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
Sorcerers are proficient with simple weapons  and one other weapon group.
They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield.
Armor of any type interferes with a sorcerer's arcane gestures, which can cause his spells with somatic components to fail.

\cf{Sor}{Wild Tolerance}
When the sorcerer fails a wild magic roll, the spell's normal effect happens in addition to its miscast effect.
See Wild Magic, below, for details.

\subsection{Class Features}
All sorcerers have the following abilities.

\cf{Sor}{Spells}
A sorcerer casts arcane spells using his Willpower.
The maximum spell level a sorcerer can learn or cast is equal to half his sorcerer level (minimum 1) or his Willpower, whichever is lower.
A sorcerer's spellpower is normally equal to his sorcerer level.

At 1st level, the sorcerer knows one 1st level spell.
At every level thereafter, the sorcerer learns one additional spell.
The spell can be of any level, up to a maximum of half the sorcerer's class level.
A sorcerer's spells are drawn from the \glossterm{unrestricted spells} on the arcane spell list (see \pcref{Arcane Spells}).

Sorcerers do not have a limit on the number of spells they can cast each day.
Their ability to cast spells is limited by their lack of control over their magic.
See Wild Magic, below, for details.

\cf{Sor}{Wild Magic}[Ex]\label{Wild Magic}
Every time a sorcerer casts a spell, except cantrips, he must make a \glossterm{wild magic roll}.
To make a wild magic roll, roll d20 \add half sorcerer level or half Willpower, whichever is higher.
The DC of the roll is equal to 10 \add the spell's level.
This roll is not an attack or check, and is not modified by abilities that affect attacks or checks.
On a natural 1, this roll always fails, regardless of other modifiers.

If the wild magic roll succeeds, the spell is cast normally.
Failure means the spell is miscast instead (see \pcref{Miscasting}).
In addition, if the sorcerer fails a wild magic roll, he cannot cast spells of the same level as the miscast spell for 10 minutes per spell level.

\cf{Sor}{Cantrip}
Cantrips are minor spells which do not require effort to use.
A sorcerer chooses one cantrip from the list of cantrips on \pref{Cantrip List}.
He may use the cantrip at will.
Cantrips cannot be miscast, and are not affected by the sorcerer's wild magic ability.
For all other purposes, cantrips are treated as 0th level spells.

At his 2nd sorcerer level, the sorcerer learns a second cantrip of his choice.

\cf{Sor}[2nd]{Arcane Adaptation}
The sorcerer gains a new ability as he adapts to the magic that flows through him.
He chooses a single arcane adaptation from the list below.
Some arcane adaptations have minimum sorcerer levels, as indicated in the title of the ability.
At his 6th sorcerer level, and every four sorcerer levels thereafter, the sorcerer gains an additional arcane adaptation.

All arcane adaptations are extraordinary abilities unless otherwise noted.

\subcf{Arcane Bloodline}
The sorcerer gains a bloodline feat of his choice.
This arcane adaptation can be taken multiple times.
Each time, the sorcerer chooses a different feat.
\subcf{Cautious Magic}
When the sorcerer fails a wild magic roll, he may choose to supress the magical energy released.
If he does, neither the spell nor its miscast effect occurs.
In addition, he loses the ability to cast spells of the same level for half as long as he normally would.
\subcf{Rapid Recovery}
When the sorcerer fails a wild magic roll to cast a spell, the time required to regain the ability to cast spells of the spell's level is reduced by 5 minutes.
\subcf{Ritual Caster}
The sorcerer gains the Ritual Caster feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites.
\subcf{6th -- Arcane Resilience}
The sorcerer gains damage reduction against arcane spells equal to his sorcerer level or Constitution, whichever is higher.
This allows him to ignore the first points of damage he takes each round.
This ability applies against the sorcerer's own miscast effects.
\subcf{6th -- Wild Retargeting}
When the sorcerer targets a random creature with a spell's miscast effect, he may roll twice to determine which creature is affected.
He chooses which result is used.
\subcf{10th -- Spell Resistance}
The sorcerer gains spell resistance equal to 10 \add his sorcerer level or Constitution, whichever is higher.
To affect the sorcerer with a spell, a caster must make an attack with an accuracy equal to its spellpower.
If the attack beats the sorcerer's spell resistance, the spell works normally.
Otherwise, the spell has no effect on the sorcerer.

This ability does not protect the sorcerer from his own miscast effects.
\subcf{10th -- Wild Explosion}
When the sorcerer miscasts a spell that explodes when miscast, the damage affects the sorcerer and enemies within a \areasmall radius of the sorcerer.
It does not affect the sorcerer's allies within that area (other than himself).
\subcf{14th -- Certain Magic}
The sorcerer becomes unable to miscast for any reason except failing a wild magic roll.
If he would miscast a spell, such as if his concentration is broken while casting, the spell simply fails to take effect.
\subcf{18th -- Miscast Immunity}
The sorcerer becomes immune to explosive and retargeting miscast effects from spells he casts and spells cast by other creatures.
He no longer takes any damage from explosive miscasts.
He may choose to be unaffected by retargeting miscast effects that target him.
This does not protect him from localized miscasts.

\cf{Sor}[3rd]{Focused Casting}[Ex]
If the sorcerer spends one minute focusing on casting a spell, he does not need to make a wild magic roll.
This prevents him from miscasting the spell due to wild magic.
If his concentration is broken while casting a spell in this way, the sorcerer automatically miscasts the spell and suffers consequences as if he had failed a wild magic roll.

\cf{Sor}[4th]{Defensive Spellblend}[Ex]
The sorcerer may combine his cantrips with his spells.
As a full-round action, the sorcerer may cast a spell that affects only himself.
The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less.
If he does, he may also use a cantrip as part of the same action.
The cantrip need not target the sorcerer.
In exchange, he gains a \plus5 bonus to his wild magic roll.
The spell's level is used to determine the bonus to the sorcerer's wild magic roll.

\cf{Sor}[8th]{Offensive Spellblend}[Ex]
This ability functions like defensive spellblend, except that the spell need not only affect the sorcerer.

\cf{Sor}[12th]{Improved Defensive Spellblend}[Ex]
The sorcerer may combine two spells together.
As a full-round action, the sorcerer may cast two spells at once, resolving each spell's effects separately.
The spells cast in this way must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less, and must be at least three spell levels apart, such as a 1st-level spell and a 4th-level spell.
In addition, one of the two spells must affect only the sorcerer.
In exchange, he gains a \plus5 bonus to his wild magic roll.
The level of the higher level spell is used to determine the bonus to the sorcerer's wild magic roll.

\cf{Sor}[16th]{Improved Offensive Spellblend}[Ex]
This ability functions like improved defensive spellblend, except that neither spell need only affect the sorcerer.

\cf{Sor}[20th]{Spellblend Mastery}[Ex]
The sorcerer may use spellblends to combine spells that are only two spell levels apart, rather than three.

\subsection{Variant Sorcerer}

Warlocks are sorcerers that draw power from pacts with otherworldly creatures.

\subsubsection{Warlock}

Warlocks cast spells without training, like sorcerers.
However, while sorcerers have innate magical power, warlocks draw power from dark pacts they have made with demons, fae, or other otherworldly creatures.

\altcf{Wild Magic} The warlock does not gain this ability.

\altcf{Pact Magic} Every time the warlock casts a spell, he must make a pact magic roll.
To make a pact magic roll, roll d20 and add the spell's level.
The DC of the roll is equal to 10 \add 1 per two warlock levels.
Failure means the spell is cast normally.
Success means that the warlock's pact backfires, allowing the dark entities which gave him power to influence the world instead.

Major changes are not possible.
\subcf{Pyromancy -- Ember}
The spellwarped can snap his fingers as a swift action to create a small ember of flame in his hand for 5 minutes.
This ember casts light as a torch, and can deal 1 point of fire damage with a successful touch attack.
The ember can be dismissed as a swift action or extinguished as a move action.
\subcf{Telekinesis -- Object Manipulation}
The spellwarped can concentrate as a standard action to move objects within five feet of him telekinetically.
He can slowly lift or manipulate one object by up to one foot per round.
The object can weigh up to five pounds.

\cf{Spl}{Spellpower}[Su]
The strength of a spellwarped's spells and abilities are determined by his spellpower.

\cf{Spl}[2nd]{Spellwarped Body}[Ex]
The spellwarped's body is fundamentally altered by exposure to magic.
He shows signs of the magic coursing through his body: strangely or inconsistently colored hair, natural skin markings which often resemble runes, and so on.
Anyone observing the spellwarped can make an Awareness or Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 20 \sub his spellwarped level to recognize that the character is a spellwarped.
Beating this DC by 10 allows the observer to determine the type of innate magic the spellwarped has.
In addition, the spellwarped gains an ability based on his innate magic.
\subcf{Alteration -- Augment Skin}
The spellwarped gains a \plus1 bonus to his Armor defense.
This bonus increases by 1 at his 10th and 20th spellwarped levels.
\subcf{Pyromancy -- Energy Resistance}

He must concentrate as a standard action to use this ability, and he may do so any number of times per day.
\subcf{Alteration -- Perceive Alteration}

This also grants him a \plus5 bonus to Awareness checks to see through disguises.
\subcf{Pyromancy -- Flame of Life}
The spellwarped can see the life-fire that lies within all living creatures, allowing him to clearly see all living creatures within 50 feet of him for 1 round.
This ability can reveal creatures hiding in concealment and defeat figments and glamers such as \spell{invisibility}, but does not reveal creatures hiding behind cover.
It also allows the spellwarped to see unusually warm objects, such as fires.
\subcf{Telekinesis -- Spatial Awareness}
The spellwarped can feel the forms of all objects and creatures around him, granting blindsense out to a 50 foot range for 1 round.
\subcf{Temporal -- Accelerated Search}
The spellwarped can accelerate his mind to immediately search everything within a 10 foot radius of him with the Awareness skill as a standard action.
Alternately, he may use this ability to read a book ten times as fast as normal.

\cf{Spl}[3rd]{Spellwarped Aspect}[Su]
The spellwarped gains a new ability based on his continued exposure to magical energy.
Most aspects are specific to particular kinds of innate magic, but some aspects can be taken by any spellwarped.
These aspects are listed under the General heading.

At his 7th spellwarped level, and every four spellwarped levels thereafter, the spellwarped gains an additional spellwarped aspect.
Some aspects require a minimum spellwarped level, as indicated in the title of the ability.
The full list of spellwarped aspects is given below.

\parhead{General}
\subcf{Spell Conduit}
The spellwarped may use his character level in place of his spellwarped level to determine his spellpower and the spellwarped invocations he has access to.
In addition, if he has the ability to cast spells, he may use his spellwarped spellpower in place of his normal spellpower from his casting class if it would be higher.
\subcf{7th -- Expanded Senses}
The range of the spellwarped's attuned senses ability doubles.
\subcf{11th -- Accelerated Recovery}
The spellwarped regains spellwarp points once per 10 minutes, rather than once per hour.
\subcf{11th -- Rapid Senses}
The spellwarped can constantly gain the benefit of his attuned senses ability.
He can toggle his enhanced senses on or off as a swift action.
If the ability does not have a duration, such as the temporal attuned senses ability, this aspect has no effect.

\parhead{Alteration}
\subcf{Damage Reduction}
The spellwarped gains damage reduction against his choice of piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage.
The amount of damage resisted is equal to half his spellpower, allowing him to ignore the first points of damage he takes each round.
If he is hit by an adamantine weapon, he cannot use his damage reduction for 1 round.
\subcf{7th -- Improved Damage Reduction}
The spellwarped's damage reduction applies against all forms of physical damage.
The spellwarped must have the damage reduction aspect to gain this aspect.
\subcf{7th -- Alter Movement}
The spellwarped gains his choice of the Legendary Balance, Legendary Climber, Legendary Leaper, or Legendary Swimmer feats, even if he does not meet the prerequisites.
He may select this aspect multiple times, choosing a different bonus feat each time.
\subcf{11th -- Alter Size}
When the spellwarped uses his surge of power, he can increase or decrease by a size category, as he chooses.
The size alteration lasts as long as his surge of power does.
This is a sizing effect, and does not stack with other sizing effects.
\subcf{15th -- Fast Healing}
While his surge of power is active, the spellwarped gains fast healing equal to half his spellpower, allowing him to heal damage each round.
This does not affect critical damage.

\parhead{Pyromancy}
\subcf{Improved Ember}
When the spellwarped uses his ember ability, he can strengthen the fire so that it illuminates up to a 40 foot radius with bright illumination.
He can also throw the ember up to 100 feet.
It burns for up to 5 rounds on its own before becoming extinguished.
\subcf{Intense Flames}
The spellwarped's attacks can ignore an amount of fire damage reduction equal to his spellpower.
\subcf{7th -- Flame Eater}
When the spellwarped resists fire damage with his spellwarped body ability, he gains temporary hit points equal to the damage resisted for 5 minutes.

\parhead{Telekinesis}
\subcf{Improved Object Manipulation}
When the spellwarped uses his object manipulation ability, he can affect objects within 10 feet, with a weight limit of up to two pounds per spellpower.
He has enough control to make checks with a DC of up to 10.
\subcf{7th -- Shieldbearer}
The spellwarped may wield shields, except tower shields, telekinetically.
The shield floats in his square, granting him its bonus to his physical defenses just as if he were wielding it.
He does not need a free hand to wield the shield and suffers no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure from it.
The shield follows him as he moves.
If it is forcibly removed from his square, he loses control over it and it falls to the ground.
\subcf{11th -- Mind Armory}
The spellwarped may control a number of weapons equal to half his Intelligence with his mind blade ability.
This does not allow him to make additional attacks per round, but he may attack interchangeably with any weapon he controls.
Each weapon threatens an area and contributes to overwhelm penalties, just as with his normal mind blade ability.

\parhead{Temporal}
\subcf{Evasion}
If the spellwarped resists a attack against his Reflex that normally deals half damage when resisted, he instead takes no damage.
Evasion can be used only if a spellwarped is \unencumbered.
A helpless spellwarped does not gain the benefit of evasion.
\subcf{Fast Movement}
The spellwarped gains a \plus10 foot bonus to movement speed.
\subcf{Uncanny Dodge}
The spellwarped not \unaware when attacked by surprise.
\subcf{7th -- Accelerate Attack}

This does not stack with any other effects which grant extra strikes.
\subcf{11th -- Improved Uncanny Dodge}
The spellwarped reduces his overwhelm penalties by 2.
If his overwhelm penalty is reduced to 0, he is not considered to be overwhelmed.

\cf{Spl}[4th]{Resist Magic}[Ex]
The power of the magic with the spellwarped offers him some measure of protection against hostile magical effects.
He gains a \plus1 bonus to special defenses against spells and spell-like abilities.
This bonus increases by \plus1 at his 8th spellwarped level and every 4 spellwarped levels thereafter.

\cf{Spl}[5th]{Manipulate Magic}[Su]
The spellwarped can channel his innate magic to manipulate other forms of magic.
Using this ability costs a spellwarp point.

\subcf{Alteration -- Absorption}
As an immediate action, when the spellwarped makes successfully resists an attack against his Fortitude from a spell or spell-like ability, he may absorb the magic harmlessly into his body.
The spell has no effect on him, even if it would normally have an effect on a failed attack.
\subcf{Pyromancy -- Fuel the Flame}
As an immediate action, when the spellwarped is affected by a spell or spell-like ability, he may channel its energy into a burst of flame around him.
Creatures within a \areasmall radius of the spellwarped take fire damage equal to his spellpower.
The spell still has its normal effect on the spellwarped.
\subcf{Telekinesis -- Mind over Matter}
As an immediate action, when the spellwarped is subject to an attack against his Fortitude from a spell or spell-like ability, he may use his Mental defense instead.
\subcf{Temporal -- Accelerate Magic}
As a swift action, the spellwarped can halve the duration of any spell or spell-like ability affecting him.
This can end the effect immediately if it has less than one round remaining.
If this would reduce the duration by more than one day, the duration is instead reduced by one day.

\cf{Spl}[9th]{Spell Resistance}[Ex]
The magic within the spellwarped allows him to completely ignore other magic, granting him spell resistance equal to 10 \add his Constitution or spellwarped level, whichever is higher.
To affect the spellwarped with a spell, a caster must make an attack with its spellpower.
If the attack beats the spellwarped's spell resistance, the spell works normally.
Otherwise, the spell has no effect on the spellwarped.

\cf{Spl}[13th]{Improved Manipulate Magic}[Su]
The spellwarped can use his manipulate magic ability to affect any ally within \rngmed range of him.

\cf{Spl}[17th]{Mass Surge of Power}[Su]
The spellwarped can share the benefits of his surge of power with his allies.
When he uses his surge of power, he can also affect up to five additional creatures within \rngmed range of him.

\cf{Spl}[19th]{Permanent Surge of Power}[Su]
The spellwarped can maintain the full power of his innate magic without limit.
He can gain the effects of his surge of power indefinitely.
He may toggle the ability on or off as a swift action at will, without expending spellwarp points.
This does not allow him to activate his mass surge of power ability at will, and his allies only gain the benefits for 5 rounds.

\subsection{Base Class Features}
A character with wizard as a base class gains the following abilities.

\classbasics{Skill Points} 5.

\classbasics{Defenses} \plus4 Mental.

\cf{Wiz}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
Wizards are proficient with simple weapons, but not with any type of armor or shield.
Armor of any type interferes with a wizard's movements, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.

\cf{Wiz}{Rituals}
Wizards can perform rituals to create unique magical effects (see \pcref{Rituals}).
A wizard begins play with a ritual book containing two arcane rituals of her choice (see \pcref{Arcane Rituals}).

\cf{Wiz}{Advanced Training}
A wizard treats her spells as if they were 1 level higher than they actually are for the purpose of meeting feat prerequisites.

\subsection{Class Features}
All wizards have the following abilities.

\cf{Wiz}{Spells}
A wizard casts arcane spells using her Intelligence.
The maximum spell level a wizard can learn or cast is equal to half her wizard level (minimum 1) or her Intelligence, whichever is lower.
A wizard's spellpower is normally equal to her wizard level.

The number of spells a wizard knows is given on \trefnp{Wizard Spells Known}.
A wizard's spells are drawn from the \glossterm{unrestricted spells} on the arcane spell list (see \pcref{Arcane Spells}).

The number of spells a wizard can cast per day is given on \trefnp{Wizard Spell Slots}.

In order to regain her spells for the day, a wizard must dismiss all her active spells and rest for 8 hours.
This rest does not have to involve sleep, but most wizards get this rest when they sleep for the night.

\cf{Wiz}{Cantrip}
Cantrips are minor spells which do not require effort to use.
A wizard chooses one cantrip from the list of cantrips on \pref{Cantrip List}.
She may use the cantrip at will.
Cantrips cannot be miscast.
For all other purposes, cantrips are treated as 0th level spells.
Specialist wizards must choose one of the cantrips granted by their specialist school.

At her 2nd wizard level, the wizard gains a second cantrip, which can be chosen from any non-prohibited school.

\cf{Wiz}[2nd]{Magic Feat}
The wizard gains a bonus magic feat or metamagic feat of her choice.
She must meet the prerequisites for the feat as normal.
At her 6th wizard level, and every 4 wizard levels thereafter, she gains an additional magic feat or metamagic feat.

\cf{Wiz}[2nd]{Specialization}
The wizard may choose to specialize in a particular school of magic.
Specialist wizards are able to learn all restricted spells from their chosen school, and gain additional spells known.
However, they can never access restricted spells from other schools, and must choose two other spell schools to ban.
A specialist wizard can never learn or cast spells or rituals from their banned schools.
Divination cannot be chosen as a banned school.

\cf{Wiz}[3rd]{Arcane Insight}[Ex]\label{Arcane Insight}
The wizard gains a greater understanding of magic.
A generalist wizard adds a restricted spell to her personal spell list.
The spell may be of any school, but she must still spend a spell known to learn it.

A specialist wizard gains an additional spell known.
The spell must be from her chosen school, including restricted spells.

In either case, the spell's level cannot exceed half her wizard level -- normally, the highest level of spells that she can cast.
At her 5th wizard level, and every odd wizard level thereafter, the wizard gains a new arcane insight.

\cf{Wiz}[4th]{Cantrip Sequencer}[Ex]
The wizard gains the ability to create a sequence of a spell and cantrip which she can cast together later.
To create an cantrip sequencer, the wizard must cast a spell which affects only herself and a cantrip, which may affect any target.
The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less.
Neither has any effect immediately.
The wizard may later use a full-round action to cast both the spell and the cantrip at once, choosing the target of the cantrip at that time.
\par The wizard may initially have only one sequencer active at any time.
At her 8th wizard level, and every 4 wizard levels thereafter, she may keep an additional sequencer active at once.
If she creates a new sequencer, it replaces one of her previous sequencers.
She may choose which old sequencer is replaced.

\cf{Wiz}[8th]{Defensive Sequencer}[Ex]
The wizard gains the ability to create a sequence of two spells which she can cast rapidly later.
To create a defensive sequencer, the wizard must cast two spells, one of which affects only herself.
The spells must be at least three levels apart, and both must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less.
Neither has any effect immediately.
The wizard may later use a full-round action to cast both spells at once, resolving their effects separately.
The number of sequencers a wizard may have active at once is limited, as described in the cantrip sequencer ability.

\cf{Wiz}[12th]{Contingency}[Ex]
The wizard gains the ability to prepare a spell so it takes effect automatically if specific circumstances arise.
To prepare a contingency, the wizard must spend 1 minute preparing the spell, which consumes the a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's level.
During this casting time, the wizard specifies what circumstances cause the spell to take effect.

The contingency can be set to trigger in response to any circumstances that a typical human observing the wizard and her situation could detect.
For example, a wizard could specify ``when I fall at least 50 feet'' or ``when I become bloodied,'' but not ``when there is an invisible creature within 50 feet of me'' or ``when I am at 17 hit points or fewer.'' The more specific the required circumstances, the better -- vague requirements, such as ``when I am in danger,'' may cause the contingency to trigger unexpectedly or fail to trigger at all.
If a wizard attempts to specify multiple separate triggering conditions, such as ``when I take damage or when an enemy is adjacent to me,'' the contingency will randomly ignore all but one of the conditions.

The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less, and it must target the wizard or have its area centered on the wizard.
Any spells which require decisions, such as \spell{dimension door}, must have those decisions made at the time the contingency is created.
The wizard cannot change those decisions when the contingency takes effect.

A wizard can have only one contingency active at a time.
If she creates another contingency, it replaces her old contingency.

\cf{Wiz}[16th]{Offensive Sequencer}[Ex]
The wizard gains the ability to create a sequence of two spells which she can cast rapidly later.
To create an offensive sequencer, the wizard must cast two spells.
The spells must be at least three levels apart, and both must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less.
One spell must be a damaging spell, and the other must not.
Neither has any effect immediately.
The wizard may later use a full-round action to cast both spells at once, resolving their effects separately.
The number of sequencers a wizard may have active at once is limited, as described in the cantrip sequencer ability.

\cf{Wiz}[20th]{Chain Contingency}[Ex]
The wizard may ready a sequencer in her contingency instead of a single spell.
This sequencer counts against her limit of available sequencers.

\section{Character Advancement}\label{Character Advancement}

As your character accomplishes challenges and defeats foes, he gains experience.
If your character has enough experience, he gains a level.
When you gain a level, you can increase your character's level in your current class or in any other class, and gain the benefits described for each class.
Rules for taking levels in multiple classes are described in \pref{Multiclass Characters}, below.

A character that increases in level gains additional benefits.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Every odd level, including 1st level, you gain a feat (see \pcref{Feats}).
    \item Every level after 1st level, you increase two different attributes of your choice by one.
    \item Every 5th level, you also increase all of your other attributes by one.
    \item At 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a \glossterm{legend point}.
\end{itemize}

If a character has multiple classes, these benefits are gained based on the total character level, not based on class level.
The experience required to reach a level, and the benefits gained at each level, are shown on \trefnp{Character Advancement}.

\section{Multiclass Characters}\label{Multiclass Characters}
A character may add new classes as he or she progresses in level, thus becoming a multiclass character.
The class abilities from a character's different classes combine to determine a multiclass character's overall abilities.
Multiclassing improves a character's versatility at the expense of focus.

\subsection{Class And Level Features}
As a general rule, the abilities of a multiclass character are the sum
of the abilities of each of the character's classes.

\parhead{Level}
``Character level'' is a character's total number of levels.
It is used to determine when feats and attribute score boosts are gained, as noted on \tref{Character Advancement}.
Whenever a creature's ``level'' is specified, without reference to a particular class, the character level is used.

\par ``Class level'' is a character's level in a particular class.
For a character whose levels are all in the same class, character level and class level are the same.

\parhead{Hit Points}
The normal rules for determining hit points apply to multiclass characters.

\parhead{Combat Prowess}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item For each type of combat prowess progression the character has, sum the character's level in classes with that combat prowess progression.
    \item Determine the character's fastest type of combat prowess progression. Good is faster than Average, which is faster than Poor.
    \item Add (levels in Good progression) + (four-fifths levels in Average progression) + (two-thirds levels in Poor progression). Each part of this calculation rounded down separately.
    \item If the character's fastest combat prowess progression is Good or Average, add 2 to the result. If it is Poor, add 1.
    \item The result is the character's combat prowess.
\end{enumerate}

\parhead{Example}
Wissy, a 2nd-level rogue/2nd-level wizard, would have a combat prowess of 4.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Wissy has 2 levels in the Average progression, and 2 levels in the Poor progression.
    \item Wissy's fastest progression type is Average.
    \item Four-fifths of 2 is 1, and two-thirds of 2 is 1, so the total is 2.
    \item Wissy's Average progression type adds 2 to the result, for a total of 4.
    \item Wissy's combat prowess is therefore 4.
\end{enumerate}

\parhead{Defenses}

For each defense, add the base defense bonuses granted by each class together.
The result is the character's total base defense bonus for that defense.

\parhead{Skills}
A multiclass character gains all class skills from all of his classes.
However, only the character's base class grants skill points.
If a character has multiple base classes, he must choose which base class grants skill points.

\parhead{Class Features}
A multiclass character gets all the class features of all his or her classes, but must also suffer the consequences of the special restrictions of all his or her classes.

\par In some cases, two classes can have virtually identical abilities.
Use the following guidelines to determine how abilities stack.
\begin{itemize}
    \item If two identical class features are not based on level and are not gained following a specific pattern, they do not stack.
    \item If two identical class features are not explicitly based on level, but both classes gain them in a predictable pattern, the levels of the two classes stack for determining when the next improvement to the class feature will be gained.
    \item If two identical class features are explicitly based on level, the levels of the two classes stack for determining the power of the ability.
    \item If two identical class features say how they stack, those rules trump any other rules.
\end{itemize}
These are some examples of how to use these guidelines.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Both a druid and a ranger gain wild speech.
        A druid/ranger who has wild speech from both classes has the same wild speech ability as a druid or ranger would.
    \item Both a barbarian and a rogue get uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge at the same level.
        A barbarian/rogue adds his barbarian and rogue levels together to determine when he acquires improved uncanny dodge.
\end{itemize}

\parhead{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
Only a character's base class grants weapon and armor proficiencies.
If a character has multiple base classes, she must choose which base class grants weapon and armor profiencies.

\subsection{Spellcasters and Multiclassing}\label{Spellcasters and Multiclassing}
The character gains spells from all of his or her spellcasting classes separately and tracks his spells per day, spells known, and spellpower separately with each class.

Characters with magical ability gain a special benefit when multiclassing.
Such a character must choose a specific spellcasting class he has.
For every two levels that a character has in nonmagical classes, up to the number of levels he has in his chosen spellcasting class, he increases his spellcasting ability with that class.
This increases his spells per day, spells known, and spellpower as if he had gained a level in his chosen spellcasting class.
No class features or other abilities can be gained in this way.


For example, Gish, a 2nd level fighter / 2th level wizard, would have the spells per day, spells known, and spellpower of a 3rd level wizard.
If he gained two more fighter levels, his spellcasting ability would not increase.
