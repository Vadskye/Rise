\subsection{Class Description Format}

\parhead{Alignment}
Some classes have alignment restrictions.
See Chapter 6: Description for a description of what alignments are.

\parhead{Class Skills}
These are skills that members of this class are typically good at.

\parhead{Skill Points}
This is the number of skill points that members of this class get.

\parhead{Weapon and Armor Proficiencies}
These are the types of equipment that members of this class are trained in using.

\parhead{Base Attack Progression}
This measures how skilled a character is in combat.
A character adds his base attack bonus to all attacks he makes, and half his base attack bonus to his physical defenses, which represents how hard he is to hit.
There are three progressions: Good, Average, or Poor.
The effects of each progression are described on \trefnp{Base Progressions}.

A high base attack bonus can grant additional attacks, as described in \pcref{Multiple Attacks}.

\parhead{Base Defense Progressions}\label{Base Defense Progressions}
This measures how resistant members of the class are to unusual kinds of attacks.
There are three kinds of special defenses.
Your Fortitude defense represents your ability to resist attacks to your body, like poisons and diseases.
Your Reflex defense represents your ability to avoid attacks, such as pit traps or explosions.
Your Mental defense represents your ability to resist mental influence, like fearsome creatures and enchantment spells.
There are three progressions: Good, Average, or Poor.
The effects of each progression are described on \trefnp{Base Progressions}.

Climb (Str), Jump (Str), Sprint (Str), Swim (Str), Balance (Dex), Ride (Dex), Tumble (Dex), Awareness (Per), Survival (Per), Creature Handling (Per), and Intimidate (Varies).

\cf{Bbn}{Skill Points}
10.

\sssecfake{Class Features}

All of the following are class features of the barbarian.
\cf{Bbn}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
 A barbarian is proficient with simple weapons, any four other weapon groups, light armor, medium armor, and shields.

\cf{Bbn}{Rage}[Ex]
A barbarian can fly into a rage as a free action.
Raging has the following benefits and drawbacks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \plus2 bonus to Strength.
    \item \plus2 bonus to Willpower.
    \item 2 temporary hit points per barbarian level.
        These extra hit points gained from raging are lost before any other hit points (see \pcref{Temporary Hit Points}).
    \item \minus2 to physical defenses.
    \item Unable to take any action that requires patience or concentration, such as casting spells.
    \item If the barbarian does not spend a swift round to sustain the rage, the rage ends at the end of the round.
    \item At the end of each round, if the barbarian did not attack a creature or object, he takes nonlethal damage equal to his barbarian level.
\end{itemize}

A rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 \add the barbarian's (newly increased) Willpower.
At the end of the rage, the barbarian takes nonlethal damage equal to the number of temporary hit points he gained by raging.
If the barbarian has any temporary hit points remaining at the end of his rage, the nonlethal damage is dealt to those hit points before they go away.
In addition, he becomes \fatigued until he rests for 5 minutes.
The barbarian cannot enter a rage while he is fatigued from his previous rage.

The amount by which the barbarian's attributes increase, and the number of temporary hit points gained per barbarian level, is called the barbarian's rage bonus.
A barbarian can fly into a rage a number of times per day equal to his rage bonus.
The barbarian's rage bonus improves to \plus3 at 8th barbarian level, to \plus4 at 14th barbarian level, and finally to \plus5 at 20th barbarian level.
His penalty to physical defenses while raging remains the same.

\cf{Bbn}[2nd]{Damage Reduction}[Ex]
A barbarian has the ability to shrug off some amount of injury from attacks.
He has damage reduction against physical damage equal to half his barbarian level.
This allows him to ignore the first points of physical damage he takes each round.

\cf{Bbn}[2nd]{Fast Movement}[Ex]
A barbarian increases his land speed by 10 feet while \unencumbered.

\cf{Bbn}[3rd]{Uncanny Dodge}[Ex]
A barbarian can react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so.
He reduces his overwhelm penalties by 1.
If his overwhelm penalty is reduced to 0, he is not considered to be overwhelmed.
In addition, he is not \unaware when attacked by surprise.

\cf{Bbn}[3rd]{Channeled Rage}
The barbarian gains the ability to channel his rage to gain new abilities.
Whenever the barbarian enters a rage, he may gain the benefits of one channeled rage he knows.
Some channeled rages depend on the barbarian's rage power.
A barbarian's rage power is equal to his Willpower or his barbarian level, whichever is higher.

At his 6th barbarian level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter, the barbarian gains an additional channeled rage.
Some channeled rages require a minimum barbarian level, as indicated before the name of the ability.
All channeled rages are extraordinary abilities unless otherwise noted.

\subcf{Athletic Rage}
The barbarian adds his rage bonus to his Climb, Jump, Sprint, and Swim checks.

\subcf{Endless Rage}
The barbarian's rage lasts for an additional 5 rounds.

\subcf{Rapid Rage}
The barbarian gains a \plus10 foot bonus to land speed.

\subcf{Savage Rage}
The barbarian gains the unarmed warrior ability (see Unarmed Warrior, \pref{Mnk:Unarmed Warrior}), increasing his power with unarmed attacks (1d6 damage for a Medium barbarian).

\subcf{Wary Rage}
The barbarian only suffers a \minus1 penalty to physical defenses for raging.

\subcf{Willful Rage}
The barbarian adds his rage bonus to his Mental defense.

\subcf{6th -- Destructive Rage}
When attacking, the barbarian ignores an amount of hardness equal to his rage power.

\subcf{6th -- Overwhelming Rage}
Overwhelmed foes the barbarian threatens increase their overwhelm penalties by 1.

\subcf{6th -- Stylish Rage}
The barbarian can initiate or change combat styles as part of the swift action he uses to sustain his rage.

\subcf{6th -- Terrifying Rage}
Whenever the barbarian makes a physical melee attack, he may also make a special attack against the target's Mental defense.
His attack bonus is equal to his rage power.
Success means the target is \shaken for 5 rounds.
\norepeatnotes

\subcf{9th -- Critical Rage}
Whenever the barbarian scores a critical hit while raging, he extends his rage by 2 rounds and gains temporary hit points equal to his rage power.

\subcf{9th -- Overpowering Rage}
The barbarian adds his rage bonus to his maneuver attacks.

\subcf{9th -- Taunting Rage}
Once per round, the barbarian can make a special attack against the Mental defense of a foe within \rngmed range of him.
His attack bonus is equal to his rage power.
If the attack succeeds, the foe is \taunted for 5 rounds.
\norepeatnotes.

\subcf{12th -- Spellbreaker Rage (Su)}
The barbarian gains spell resistance equal to 10 \add his rage power.
To affect the barbarian with a spell, a caster must make an attack with its spellpower.
If the attack beats the barbarian's spell resistance, the spell works normally.
Otherwise, the spell has no effect on the barbarian.

\subcf{12th -- Terrifying Rage, Improved}
This channeled rage functions like terrifying rage, except that it affects all foes the barbarians threatens.
The barbarian must have the terrifying rage ability to choose this ability.

\subcf{12th -- Whirlwind Rage}
Whenever the barbarian is threatened by at least five creatures, he gains a physical damage bonus equal to his rage bonus.

\subcf{15th -- Mindless Rage}
The barbarian becomes immune to mind-affecting spells and effects.

\subcf{15th -- Taunting Rage, Improved}
This channeled rage functions like taunting rage, except that it affects all foes the barbarians threatens.
The barbarian must have the taunting rage rage ability to choose this ability.

%\subcf{18th -- Hurricane Rage} This channeled rage functions like whirlwind rage, except that the damage bonus is equal to the number of foes the barbarian threatens, up to a maximum bonus equal to twice his rage bonus.
%The barbarian must have the whirlwind rage ability to choose this ability.

\subcf{18th -- Invulnerable Rage}
The barbarian doubles his damage reduction.
%This replaces his rage bonus to Strength.

\cf{Bbn}[4th]{Mighty Will}[Ex]
The barbarian gains a \plus5 bonus to Mental defense against compulsion effects.

\cf{Bbn}[5th]{Improved Damage Reduction}[Ex]
The barbarian can apply his damage reduction against any attack which deals damage, including magical and supernatural attacks.
This counts against his total damage reduced that round.

\cf{Bbn}[7th]{Larger than Life}[Ex]
A barbarian holds the strength of a giant in the body of a man (or woman).
The barbarian is treated as being one size category larger than he actually is for all purposes except his physical space and reach, and the weapons he wields.
Although he uses weapons of the same size as normal, his weapons deal damage as if they were one size category larger, including natural weapons and unarmed strikes.
The benefits of this class feature stack with the effects of spells and abilities that increase the barbarian's size category.

\cf{Bbn}[10th]{Improved Uncanny Dodge}[Ex]
The barbarian reduces his overwhelm penalties by 2.
This does not stack with the effects of uncanny dodge.
If his overwhelm penalty is reduced to 0, he is not considered to be overwhelmed.

\cf{Bbn}[11th]{Tireless Rage}[Ex]
The barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his rage.

\cf{Bbn}[12th]{Chaotic Rage}[Ex]
The barbarian gains the ability to change channeled rage abilities at will, without consuming an additional use of his rage ability.
He may not change channeled rages in this way more than once per round.

\cf{Bbn}[13th]{Indomitable Will}[Ex]
The barbarian becomes immune to compulsion spells and effects.

\cf{Bbn}[15th]{Damage Retaliation}[Ex]
At the end of each round, if the barbarian's damage reduction is fully exhausted, he gains a \plus2 damage bonus during the next round.

\cf{Bbn}[16th]{Grit}[Ex]
The barbarian's fortitude knows no bounds.
If he resists an attack against his Fortitude, it has no effect on him, even if it would normally have an effect on a failed attack.

\cf{Bbn}[17th]{Larger than Belief}[Ex]
The barbarian's larger than life ability improves.
He is treated as being two size categories larger than he actually is.

\cf{Bbn}[19th]{Deathless Rage}[Ex]
While raging, the barbarian ignores penalties from critical damage and does not fall unconscious due to critical damage.

\subsubsection{Ex-Barbarians}
A barbarian who becomes lawful loses his ability to rage, and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian.
He retains all his other class features.
If he stops being lawful, he regains his ability to rage and take barbarian levels.

These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of his race.

\cf{Clr}{Domains}
A cleric chooses two domains, which represent his personal spiritual inclinations.
If he has a deity, he must choose his domains from among those his deity offers.
A cleric's choice of domains has broad effects on the cleric's spellcasting and supernatural abilities.

\begin{itemize}
    \item{Air} 
    \item{Chaos}

\cf{Clr}{Spells}
A cleric casts divine spells using his devotion.
A cleric's spellpower is normally equal to his divine power.
See the Divine Power ability, below.

The number of spells a cleric knows is given on \trefnp{Cleric Spells Known}.
The cleric may learn spells from both the divine spell list (see \pcref{Divine Spells}) and his domain spell lists (see \pcref{Cleric Domains}).
Sometimes these domain spells are spells on normally available on the divine spell list, but often they are only accessible by the domain.

The number of spells a cleric can cast per day is given on \trefnp{Cleric Spell Slots}.

In order to regain his spell slots for the day, the cleric must dismiss all his active spells and spend 1 hour performing a ritual, worshipping, or quietly contemplating.
The cleric cannot regain spell slots in this way more than once per day.

A cleric can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to his own or his deity's (if he has one).
Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.

\sssecfake{Class Skills}
The druid's class skills (and the key attribute for each skill) are Climb (Str), Jump (Str), Sprint (Str), Swim (Str), Balance (Dex), Ride (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Heal (Int), Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Awareness (Per), Creature Handling (Per), Survival (Per), and Intimidate (Varies).

\cf{Drd}{Skill Points}
10.

\sssecfake{Class Features}
All of the following are class features of the druid.

\cf{Drd}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
Druids are proficient with simple weapons, any one other weapon group, scimitars, sickles, and slings.
\par Druids are proficient with light and medium armor, but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor.
(A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the \spell{ironwood} spell so that it functions as though it were steel.
See the \spell{ironwood} ritual description.) Druids are proficient with shields, but must use only wooden ones.
\par A druid who wears prohibited armor or carries a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.

\cf{Drd}{Bonus Languages}
A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of magical woodland creatures.
This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.

A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid.
Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot.
Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.
Druidic has its own alphabet.

\cf{Drd}{Spells}
A druid casts nature spells using her attunement with nature.
A druid's spellpower is normally equal to her druid level.
However, see the Attunement ability, below.

At 1st level, the druid knows one 1st level spell.
At every level theareafter, she learns one additional spell.
The spell can be of any level, up to a maximum of half the sorcerer's class level.
A sorcerer's spells are drawn from the spells on the nature spell list (see \pcref{Nature Spells}).

Druids have a limit on the number of spells they can cast, as given on \trefnp{Druid Spell Slots}.
Attuning to a natural environment for an hour, as described above, restores all spell slots the druid has expended.

\cf{Drd}{Rituals}
Druids can perform rituals to create unique magical effects (see \pcref{Rituals}).
A druid begins play with a ritual book containing one nature ritual of her choice (see \pcref{Nature Rituals}).

\cf{Drd}{Attunement}[Su]
Whenever the druid is in a natural environment, she may dismiss all her active spells and spend one hour attuning to the natural world.
If she does so, she regains all her spell slots. In addition, she gains a \plus5 bonus to her spellpower for as long as she stays in a natural environment, and for five minutes after leaving a natural environment.

\cf{Drd}[2nd]{Wild Speech}[Su]
The druid learns how to communicate with animals.
As a standard action, the druid can choose a type of animal, such as owl or wolf.
She gains the ability to speak to and understand animals of that type for 5 minutes.
A druid can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Perception or half her druid level, whichever is higher.

This ability doesn't make the animals any more friendly or cooperative than normal.
Furthermore, wary and cunning animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while the more stupid ones make inane comments.
If an animal is friendly toward the druid, she may be able to convince it to do some favor or service.

\cf{Drd}[2nd]{Natural Casting}[Ex]
Whenever the druid casts a nature spell with an area that originate from her, such as most cone or line spells, she may cause the spell to originate from any location within 10 feet of her.
All other aspects of the spell are unchanged.

For example, a druid casting \spell{gust of wind} could create a line of wind originating from 10 feet to her right.
The line would extend 50 feet out from that point, as normal.
If the druid cause the line of wind to blow to the left, she could potentially be affected by the wind.

\cf{Drd}[3rd]{Wild Aspect}[Su]
The druid gains the ability to embody an aspect of an animal.
Unless otherwise noted, embodying a wild aspect is a swift action.
The druid can embody a wild aspect a number of times per day equal to her Constitution or half her druid level, whichever is higher.

A wild aspect normally lasts for a number of rounds equal to 5 \add the druid's Constitution.
If the druid embodies an additional wild aspect, the first aspect ends at the end of the round.
All wild aspects can be dismissed as a swift action.

The druid chooses one wild aspect from the list below.
Some wild aspects have minimum druid levels, as indicated in the title of the aspect.
At her 5th druid level, and every odd druid level thereafter, the druid gains an additional wild aspect.
The list of wild aspects is given below.
All wild aspects are supernatural abilities unless otherwise noted.

The descriptions below describe the effects of the aspect.
With many aspects, the druid's appearance also changes to match the aspect, but this is not described.
Different druids change in different ways.
For example, one druid might gain unusually large eyes when embodying the low-light vision aspect, while another might change her irises into slits, like a cat, when embodying the same aspect.
The changes made are up to the druid, but cannot be used to gain an additional substantive benefit beyond the effects given in the description of the aspect.

\subcf{Animal Affinity}
The druid gains a \plus2 bonus to Creature Handling and Ride checks.
\subcf{Armaments of the Bear}
The druid's mouth and hands transform, allowing her to perform bite and claw attacks.
The bite attack deals 1d8 damage for a Medium druid, and the claws deal 1d6 damage.
(See \pcref{Natural Weapons}, for details about natural weapons.)
\subcf{Constrict}
The druid's body transforms, allowing her to perform a constrict attack.
The attack deals 1d10 damage for a Medium druid, but it can only be used against a foe she is grappling with.
(See \pcref{Natural Weapons}, for details about natural weapons).
\subcf{Gore}
The druid's head transforms, allowing it to perform a gore attack.
The attack deals 1d8 damage for a Medium druid.
(See \pcref{Natural Weapons}, for details about natural weapons.)
\subcf{Lope}
The druid gains the ability to move on all four limbs.
When doing so, she increases her speed by 20 feet, but she cannot use her hands for anything except moving.
When not moving on four legs, her ability to use her hands is unchanged.
\subcf{Low-light Vision}
The druid gains low-light vision.
She treats sources of light as if they had double their normal illumination range.
\subcf{Talons}
The druid's feet transform, allowing her to perform a talon attack.
\subcf{5th -- Bear's Endurance}
The druid gains a \plus2 bonus to Constitution.
This cannot increase her Constitution above her druid level.
\subcf{5th -- Bull's Strength}
The druid gains a \plus2 enhancement bonus to Strength.
This cannot increase her Strength above her druid level.
\subcf{5th -- Cat's Grace}
The druid gains a \plus2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity.
This cannot increase her Dexterity above her druid level.
\subcf{5th -- Climb}
The druid gains a climb speed equal to her base land speed.
\subcf{5th -- Fox's Cunning}
The druid gains a \plus2 enhancement bonus to Intelligence.
This cannot increase her Intelligence above her druid level.
\subcf{5th -- Glide}
The druid grows wings, granting her a glide speed equal to her land speed.
See \pcref{Gliding}, for more details.
\subcf{5th -- Mule's Tenacity}
The druid gains a \plus2 enhancement bonus to Willpower.
This cannot increase her Willpower above her druid level.
\subcf{5th -- Owl's Insight}
The druid gains a \plus2 enhancement bonus to Perception.
This cannot increase her Perception above her druid level.
\subcf{5th -- Shrink}
As a full-round action, the druid can shrink by a size category.
This functions like the \spell{reduce person} spell, except that it only affects the druid.
This is a sizing effect.
\subcf{5th -- Slither}
The druid gains a climb speed equal to half her base land speed.
She does not need to use her hands to climb in this way.
See \pcref{Climbing}, for more details.
\subcf{7th -- Natural Grab}
If the druid hits with a natural attack, she may attempt to grapple her foe as an immediate action.
\subcf{7th -- Natural Knockback}
If the druid hits with a natural attack, she may attempt to shove her foe as an immediate action.
She cannot move with the struck creature to push it back farther.
\subcf{7th -- Natural Trip}
If the druid hits with a natural attack, she may attempt to trip her foe as an immediate action.
See \pcref{Climbing}, for more details.
\subcf{7th -- Scent}
The druid gains the scent ability, granting her a \plus10 bonus to scent-based Awareness checks (see \pcref{Awareness}).
\subcf{7th -- Wolfpack}
Overwhelmed foes the druid threatens increase their overwhelm penalties by 1.
\subcf{9th -- Grow}
As a full-round action, the druid can grow by a size category.
This functions as the \spell{enlarge person} spell, except that it only affects the druid.
This is a sizing effect.
\subcf{9th -- Limited Flight}
The druid grows wings, granting her a fly speed equal to her land speed with average maneuverability.
See \pcref{Flying}, for more details.
She can only fly for a number of rounds equal to 3 \add half her Constitution.
After that limit is reached, she must rest for 5 minutes.
\subcf{9th -- Swiftstrike}
The druid's attack speed increases.
When she makes a full attack, she may make an additional attack.
This attack must be made with a natural weapon.
This effect does not stack with similar effects that grant extra attacks.
\subcf{9th -- Venom}
When the druid embodies this aspect, she transforms one of her natural weapons to become poisonous.
If she hits with that natural attack, she may inject poison into the struck creature as an immediate action.
At the end of each round, the druid makes a special attack vs. Fortitude against all creatures she has poisoned with this ability.
If the attack succeeds, the creature takes 1d6 physical damage per two druid levels and is \sickened for 5 rounds.
The poison lasts until the druid fails the attack twice.
%TODO poison stacking rules

\cf{Drd}[3rd]{Woodland Stride}[Ex]
The druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.
However, plants magically manipulated to impede motion still affect her.

\cf{Drd}[4th]{Venom Immunity}[Ex]
The druid gains immunity to all poisons.

\cf{Drd}[6th]{Wild Speech (Plants)}[Ex]
The druid can also converse with plants and plant creatures using her wild speech ability.
A regular plant's sense of its surroundings is limited, so it won't be able to give (or recognize) detailed descriptions of creatures or answer questions about events outside its immediate vicinity.

\cf{Drd}[7th]{Wild Abundance}[Su]
When the druid uses her wild aspect ability, she may embody two wild aspects at once.
She may embody them both as part of the same action, or add an additional wild aspect later.
This consumes one use of her wild aspect ability per aspect assumed.
If the druid embodies an additional aspect beyond her maximum, she chooses which aspect ends at the end of the round.

At 13th level, the druid can assume three aspects at once. At 19th level, she may assume four aspects at once.

\cf{Drd}[8th]{Commanding Wild Speech}[Su]
As a standard action that consumes a use of her wild speech ability, the druid can attempt to charm a creature she is speaking with using her wild speech ability.
If she succeeds at a special attack vs. Mental defense, the target is charmed.
The effect lasts for the duration of the conversation, and for 1 hour thereafter.
This ability is not mind-affecting, and can affect creatures or even objects of any kind that the druid can use her wild speech to converse with.
The attack automatically succeeds against non-intelligent objects.
The druid's special attack bonus with commanding wild speech is equal to her druid level \add her Willpower.

A charmed creature or object regards the druid as a trusted friend and ally.
The druid cannot control the subject as if it were an automaton, but it perceives her words and actions in the most favorable way.
She can try to give the subject orders, but she must succeed at a Persuasion check to convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do.
(Retries are not allowed.) Treat the subject as a friend (a \plus10 relationship modifier) for the purpose of the Persuasion check.
An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing.

\cf{Drd}[10th]{Improved Natural Casting}[Ex]
The druid expands the range of her natural casting ability.
She can cause area spells to originate from up to \rngclose range away from her.

\cf{Drd}[11th]{Natural Aspect}[Su]
The druid gains the ability to embody aspects of the natural world, including the elements, in addition to those of animals.
She adds the options below to the list of abilities she can gain with her wild aspect ability.

%\subcf{Aerial Combat} The druid gains a \plus2 bonus to physical attacks while either she or her target is airborne.
%\subcf{Aquatic Combat} The druid gains a \plus2 bonus to physical attacks while both she and her target are touching naturally occuring water (including rain, but not fog or ice).

%\subcf{Earthen Combat} The druid gains a \plus2 bonus to physical attacks with melee attacks while both she and her target are touching natural earth or stone.
%\subcf{Fiery Combat} The druid gains a \plus2 bonus to physical attacks while she or her target is ignited.
%\subcf{Earthen Might} The druid gains a \plus2 bonus to caster level while she is touching natural earth or stone.
\subcf{Heart of Air} The druid can breathe in any environment, and is immune to \spell{sickening cloud}
and similar effects.
In addition, she falls at half speed and takes no falling damage.
\subcf{Heart of Earth} The druid gains the effects of the \spell{stoneskin}
spell, with a spellpower equal to her druid level or Constitution.
\subcf{Heart of Fire} The druid gains the effects of the warm version of the \spell{fire shield}
spell, with a spellpower equal to her druid level or Constitution.
\subcf{Heart of the Sun}
The druid constantly radiates bright light out to a 100 foot radius (and shadowy illumination for an additional 100 feet).
The illumination is so bright that she becomes hard to look at.
Any creature attacking her from within the radius of bright light becomes dazzled for 5 rounds after the attack.
\subcf{Heart of Oak} The druid gains the effects of the \spell{stoneskin}
spell, with a spellpower equal to her druid level or Constitution, except that the damage reduction is overcome by fire instead of adamantine weapons.
\subcf{Heart of Water} The druid gains the effects of the \spell{freedom}
spell.
\subcf{15th -- Air Mantle}
 The druid is surrounded by a mantle of air.
Thrown and projectile weapons have a 50\% chance to miss her while this effect is active.
Unusually large weapons, such as a giant's boulders, may suffer a decreased miss chance as appropriate to their size.
\subcf{15th -- Aqueous Step}
 Wherever the druid moves, she leaves a path of animated water that can grab creatures.
Whenever a creature crosses the path, the druid makes a Reflex attack to trip the creature, causing it to fall prone and waste the rest of its movement.
Her attack bonus is equal to her druid level \add her Constitution.
\subcf{15th -- Flaming Step}
Wherever the druid moves, she leaves a path of burning flame behind her that lasts for 1 round.
Whenever a creature crosses the path, the druid makes a Reflex attack to deal damage to the creature.
The attack deals 1d6 points of fire damage per two druid levels.
Her attack bonus is equal to her druid level \add her Constitution.
A failed attack deals half damage.
\subcf{15th -- Lifegiving Step}
Wherever the druid moves, she leaves a path of small, living plants that entangle foes for 1 round.
Whenever a creature crosses the path, the druid makes a Reflex attack to entangle the creature, causing it to waste the rest of its movement.
Her attack bonus is equal to her druid level \add her Constitution.
The plants appear on any surface, and will continue to grow if they can survive, though they may die quickly if they appear on inhospitable terrain.
\subcf{17th -- Flight}
The druid gains a fly speed equal to her land speed, with good maneuverability.
She may remain flying for up to 5 rounds at a time.
After that, she must land for 1 round before she can fly again.
See \pcref{Flying}, for more details.
\subcf{17th -- Flaming Soul}
The druid gains the fire subtype, making her immune to fire but giving her a 50\% vulnerability to cold damage.
In addition, whenever she deals fire damage to a creature, the creature is \ignited for 5 rounds.
\subcf{17th -- Sunblessed Rejuvenation}
The druid gains fast healing equal to her druid level as long as she remains in sunlight or touches a plant of her size or larger.
\subcf{17th -- Sunscour}
This aspect functions like the heart of the sun natural aspect, except that it also suppresses shadow effects and the visual components of illusions within the area of bright light.

\subcf{17th -- Water's Flow}
As a swift action, the druid can transform herself into a rushing flow of water with a volume roughly equal to her normal volume until the end of her turn.
In this form, she may move wherever water could go, but she cannot take other actions, such as jumping, attacking, or casting spells.
Her speed is halved when moving uphill and doubled when moving downhill.
She may move through squares occupied by creatures or threatened by blocking enemies without penalty.
She may return to her normal form as a free action.
\par If the water is split, she may reform from anywhere the water has reached, to as little as a single ounce of water.
If not even an ounce of water exists contiguously, her body reforms from the largest available parts of water, cut into pieces of appropriate size.
This usually causes the druid to die.

\cf{Drd}[12th]{A Thousand Faces}[Su] The druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the \spell{disguise self}
spell.
This affects the druid's body but not her possessions.
It is not an illusory effect, but a minor physical alteration of the druid's appearance, within the limits described for the spell.

\cf{Drd}[14th]{Elemental Speech}[Su]
The druid gains the ability to speak with one of the elements that make up the natural world with her wild speech ability.
When she gains this ability, she chooses whether she can speak with natural air, earth, fire, or water.
That choice cannot thereafter be changed.

\cf{Drd}[14th]{Timeless Body}[Ex]
The druid no longer takes attribute penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged.
Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place.
Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.

\cf{Drd}[16th]{Dominating Wild Speech}[Ex]
When the druid uses her commanding wild speech ability, she can dominate the subject (as the \spell{dominate person}
spell) instead of charming it.
This ability is not mind-affecting, and can affect creatures of any kind that the druid can converse with.
The attack automatically succeeds against non-intelligent objects.

\cf{Drd}[18th]{Totem Aspect}[Su]
The druid can choose any one wild aspect (but not natural aspect).
She permanently gains the abilities of that aspect, as if she was constantly manifesting it.
She may suppress or resume this effect as a swift action.

\cf{Drd}[20th]{Greater Natural Casting}[Ex]
The druid may cause area spells to originate from any point within \rngmed range of her, as the natural casting ability.

\subsubsection{Ex-Druids}
A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and supernatural druid class features.
She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the \spell{atonement} ritual).

\cd{Alignment} Any.

\sssecfake{Class Skills}
The fighter's class skills (and the key attribute for each skill) are Climb (Str), Jump (Str), Sprint (Str), Swim (Str), Balance (Dex), Escape Artist (Dex), Ride (Dex), Tumble (Dex), Awareness (Per), Intimidate (Varies), Bluff (\x), and Persuasion (\x).

\cf{Ftr}{Skill Points}
5.

\sssecfake{Class Features}
All of the following are class features of the fighter.
\cf{Ftr}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
 A fighter is proficient with simple weapons, any four other weapon groups,  all armor (heavy, medium, and light) and shields.

\cf{Ftr}{Armor Discipline}
A fighter's training grants him additional capability in armor.
He must choose to improve his agility or his resilience in armor.
This applies to all armor discipline abilities the fighter has.
If he improves his agility, he reduces his armor check penalty by 2 and reduces his arcane spell failure by 5\% while wearing body armor.
If he improves his resilience, he gains a \plus1 bonus to Armor defense while wearing body armor.

\cf{Ftr}[2nd]{Bonus Feat}
The fighter gets a bonus combat-oriented feat.
This bonus feat must be drawn from the feats noted as combat feats on \tref{Combat Feats}.
A fighter must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including attribute score and base attack bonus minimums.
The fighter gains an additional bonus feat at his 6th fighter level and every four fighter levels thereafter (6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th).

\cf{Ftr}[3rd]{Weapon Discipline}
The fighter's training grants him additional capability when using his weapons.
He may choose a weapon group, or he may choose to train equally with all weapons.
If he chooses a weapon group, he gains a \plus1 bonus to physical attacks with weapons from that group.

If he chooses not to focus on a specific group of weapons, he gains the ability to become proficient with any weapon group if he spends 1 hour training with a weapon from that group.
He may only keep this proficiency with one weapon group at a time; if he trains with a new weapon group, he loses his proficiency in the previous group.

\cf{Ftr}[4th]{Adaptive Combat Feats}
The fighter gains a flexible bonus feat which he can change periodically.
The fighter chooses a number of combat feats equal to half his fighter level or half his Intelligence, whichever is higher.
These feats comprise his adaptive feat pool.
The fighter gains one of the feats from his adaptive feat pool as a bonus feat.
By training for an hour, the fighter can change his current adapative combat feat to one of the other feats in his adaptive style feat pool.
He must meet the prerequisites for the new feat.

\par An adaptive style feat may be used normally as prerequisites for other feats or abilities.
However, if an adaptive style feat is used as a prerequisite, it cannot be changed until the fighter no longer needs to use it as a prerequisite, such as might happen if the fighter takes the feat as a normal feat or bonus feat.

\par In order to gain an adaptive style feat, it must be reasonably possible to do training related to the new feat.
For example, a fighter could not gain Weapon Focus in axes without at least one axe available to train with.

The fighter gains an additional adaptive combat feat at his 8th fighter level and every four fighter levels thereafter (8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th).
He may change all of his adaptive combat feats at once when he trains.

\cf{Ftr}[5th]{Combat Discipline}
The fighter can use his superior training and focus to keep fighting in the face of debilitating effects.
When a fighter is initially affected by one of the conditions listed on \trefnp{Combat Discipline Conditions}, he may use his combat discipline ability to instead suffer the mitigated condition one column to the right.
He can suppress the condition up to 5 rounds.

\par Using combat discipline takes no action, and can be done at any time, even when it isn't the fighter's turn.
A fighter may use this ability a number of times per day equal to his Willpower or half his fighter level, whichever is higher.
However, he cannot mitigate more than one condition at a time.
If the fighter attempts to mitigate a new condition, the old condition resumes its normal effect immediately.

    1.  Mitigate up to half fighter level or half Constitution, whichever is greater. \\
    2.  Mitigates the impairment, but does not prevent the fighter from taking d6 fire damage per round until the fire is put out.  \\
    3.  Mitigate a single negative level. \\
\end{dtable}

\par A fighter can never use this ability more than once against a single source.
For example, if a fighter is confused by a \spell{confusion} spell, he can use this ability to become disoriented instead of confused, but he can't then expend a second use to stop being disoriented.
The lesser condition that this ability imposes may be cured or removed normally, but doing so does not affect the resurgence of the condition the fighter was originally afflicted with.
If a fighter uses this ability to mitigate or negate a condition which he must suffer as a sacrifice or cost to gain some benefit, he automatically forfeits the benefit he would have gained.

\cf{Ftr}[7th]{Improved Armor Discipline}
The fighter's training with his armor improves.
If he chose agility, he reduces his armor check penalty by 4 and decreases his arcane spell failure by 15\%.
This does not stack with the effects of armor discipline.
In addition, he treats all body armor as if it were one encumbrance category lighter than it is.
\par This ability means heavy armor is treated as medium armor, medium armor is treated as light armor, and light armor is treated as being unarmored.
This can remove the halving of the fighter's Dexterity bonus, if appropriate for the new encumbrance of the fighter's armor.
This allows the fighter to qualify for class features using the reduced armor encumbrance category.
For example, a fighter 9 / wizard 2 who reduces his encumbrance in light armor could cast spells without any arcane spell failure in light armor.

If the fighter chose resilience, he gains damage reduction against physical damage equal to half his fighter level. This allows him to ignore the first points of damage he would take each round.

\cf{Ftr}[9th]{Improved Weapon Discipline}
The fighter's training in his chosen weapons improves.
He gains a \plus4 bonus to resist disarm attempts against using his chosen weapons.
If he chose a specific weapon group, he gains a \plus2 bonus to physical attacks with weapons from that group.
This does not stack with effects of weapon discipline.
If he did not, he can apply all weapon group-specific feats he has to any weapon group that he trains with for 1 hour.
He retains this benefit for one week after the training.

\cf{Ftr}[10th]{Battlemaster}
The fighter can improve his allies' combat abilities.
As a standard action, he may grant the use of one of his combat feats to allies within \rngmed range of him who can see and hear him.
He can affect a number of allies equal to half his Intelligence (minimum 1).
Affected allies must meet base attack bonus prerequisites for the granted feat, but they can ignore all other prerequisites.
The effect lasts as long as the fighter spends a standard action to maintain the effect, and for 5 rounds thereafter.
The fighter can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his Intelligence or half his fighter level, whichever is higher.

\cf{Ftr}[11th]{Improved Combat Discipline}
The fighter's ability to keep fighting despite negative influence improves.
He can reduce conditions by two steps instead of one when using combat discipline.
For example, a stunned fighter who used combat discipline would instead be staggered.
\par In addition, a fighter may use combat discipline to reduce any penalties he suffers to his attacks, damage, checks, or defenses by 2, even if the source of the penalty is not listed on the combat discipline chart.
\par The fighter may also mitigate up to two conditions at once.

\cf{Ftr}[13th]{Greater Armor Discipline}
The fighter's training in his chosen armor becomes still greater.
If he chose agility, he reduces his armor check penalty by 6 and decreases his arcane spell failure by 30\% while wearing armor of any kind.
In addition, he treats all armor as if it were two encumbrance categories lighter than it actually is whenever doing so would be beneficial to him.
This does not stack with the benefits of armor discipline or improved armor discipline.

If the fighter chose resilience, he may apply his damage reduction against all damage, including from magical attacks.

\cf{Ftr}[14th]{Improved Adaptive Combat}
The fighter's ability to adapt to situations improves.
He need only spend 1 minute training to change his adaptive combat feats.

\cf{Ftr}[15th]{Greater Weapon Discipline}
The fighter's training in his chosen weapons becomes still greater.
He increases the critical threat range of his chosen weapons by 1.
This increase applies after and stacks with any other effects that affect critical threat range.
Thus, a fighter using the Heartseeker combat style (see Heartseeker, page \featpref{Heartseeker}) would have a critical threat range of 18-20.

\cf{Ftr}[17th]{Greater Combat Discipline}
The fighter's ability to keep fighting despite influence becomes still greater.
When using combat discipline, he may ignore any condition listed on the combat discipline chart.
In addition, he may use combat discipline to be \severelyimpaired with all actions rather than suffer any non-damaging condition not listed on the chart.

\par The fighter may also mitigate up to three conditions at once.

\cf{Ftr}[18th]{Improved Battlemaster}
The fighter can improve his allies' combat abilities more effectively.
When using his battlemaster ability, he can grant two feats at once.
In addition, he can use his battlemaster ability as a swift action.

\cf{Ftr}[19th]{True Discipline}
The fighter's discipline in his chosen area is beyond equal.
He must choose either weapon discipline, armor discipline, or combat discipline.
Depending on which discipline he chooses, he gains a different bonus.
\subcf{True Weapon Discipline}
When the fighter makes a full attack, he can make an additional attack.
This does not stack with any other effects which grant extra attacks.
\subcf{True Armor Discipline}
If the fighter chose agility, he no longer suffers armor check penalties or arcane spell failure with any armor.
He ignores the encumbrance of all armor, causing him to be treated as unarmored whenever doing so is beneficial to him.
In addition, he applies the defense bonus from any body armor he wears to his Reflex defense.

If the fighter chose resilience, he may apply his Constutition to his Reflex defense in place of his Dexterity while wearing armor of any kind.
In addition, he applies the defense bonus from any body armor he wears to his Fortitude defense.
\subcf{True Combat Discipline}
The fighter can use combat discipline to be \impaired with all actions instead of suffering any nondamaging negative effect with a duration.
He may also mitigate up to four conditions at once.

\cf{Ftr}[20th]{Greater Adaptive Combat}
The fighter's ability to react to situations is unparalleled.
As a swift action, he can exchange a single adaptive combat feat from his adapative feat pool.

All of the following are class features of the monk.
\cf{Mnk}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
Monks are proficient with simple weapons, monk weapons, and any one other weapon group.
Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields.
When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses the benefit of her enlightened defense, fast movement, and \ki abilities.

\cf{Mnk}{Ki Power}[Su]
Many monk abilities depend on her \ki power.
A monk's \ki power is equal to her Willpower or her monk level, whichever is higher.

\cf{Mnk}{Enlightened Defense}[Ex]
A monk's \ki shields her body from attacks.
When \monkunencumbered, she gains a \plus3 bonus to Armor defense.

When \monkunencumbered, a monk gains a \plus1 armor bonus to AC at 2nd level.
This bonus increases by 1 for every two monk levels thereafter (\plus2 at 4th, \plus3 at 6th, etc.).

\par The monk loses this bonus when she is
immobilized or helpless, when she wears any armor, when she carries a shield, or when she carries a medium or heavy load.
\end{comment}

\cf{Mnk}{Unarmed Warrior}[Ex]
A monk's unarmed attacks are exceptionally deadly.
She gains the Improved Unarmed Strike feat as a bonus feat.
In addition, she deals damage with her unarmed strikes as if she were two size categories larger than her actual size (1d6 for a Medium creature, or 1d4 for a small creature).
For details about how to fight while unarmed, see \pcref{Unarmed Combat}.

\cf{Mnk}[2nd]{Manifest Ki}[Su]
The monk gains the ability to channel her \ki energy to temporarily enhance her abilities.
This ability can be used a number of times per day equal to her Willpower or half her monk level, whichever is higher.

She chooses one \ki manifestation from the list below.
Some \ki manifestations have minimum monk levels, as indicated in the title of the power.
At her 5th monk level, and every three monk levels thereafter, the monk learns an additional \ki manifestation.

If the monk redirects the attack, the foe rolls the same attack against the third creature.
\subcf{11th -- Diamond Fists}
As a swift action, the monk can empower her unarmed attacks with incredible force.
Until the end of the round, she may use her \ki power in place of her normal modifiers to physical damage with her unarmed attacks.

\subcf{11th -- Flash Step}
As a move action, the monk can slip between spaces, allowing her to teleport to anywhere she can see within 30 feet.

At any point during that time, the monk can will the struck target to die (a free action).
If she does, and the creature is \bloodied, she makes a special attack vs. Fortitude.
If the attack succeeds, the creature loses all its hit points and takes critical damage equal to her monk level, causing it to begin dying (see \pcref{Dying}).
\subcf{17th -- Moment of Perfection}
The monk can align herself with the universe to achieve a single moment of perfection.
As a swift action, she can add her monk level as an enhancement bonus to any single physical attack or opposed check.

spell.
For the duration of the effect, she may switch between the planes as a move action.

\cf{Mnk}[3rd]{Evasion}[Ex]
If the monk resists a Reflex attack that normally deals half damage when resisted, she instead takes no damage.
Evasion can be used only if a monk is \unencumbered.
A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.

\cf{Mnk}[3rd]{Uncanny Dodge}[Ex]
The monk can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so.
The monk reduces her overwhelm penalties by 1.
If her overwhelm penalty is reduced to 0, she is not considered to be overwhelmed.

%cf defense in place of half her Intelligence]
%If she has an Intelligence penalty, that penalty still applies.

\cf{Mnk}[6th]{Ki Augmentation}[Su]
The monk's control over her \ki improves, allowing her to permanently improve her abilities.
She chooses one \ki augmentation from the list below.
Some \ki manifestations have minimum monk levels, as indicated in the title of the power.
At her 12th and 18th monk levels, she gains an additional \ki augmentation.

\subcf{Distant \Ki}
The monk gains an additional five feet of reach with her unarmed attacks, extending her threatened area.
\subcf{Gentle \Ki}

\subcf{Perfect Sight}
The monk continuously gains the benefits of the \spell{see invisibility} spell.
\subcf{Perfect Speech}
The monk gains the ability to speak with and understand the speech of any creature.

The monk continuously gains the benefits of the \spell{freedom} spell.
\subcf{12th -- Perfect Soul}
The monk gains spell resistance equal to 10 \add her \ki power.
To affect the monk with a spell, a caster must make an attack with its spellpower.
If the attack beats the monk's spell resistance, the spell works normally.
Otherwise, the spell has no effect on the monk.

\cf{Mnk}[7th]{Bodily Perfection}[Ex]
The monk gains a \plus1 bonus to her Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution.

\cf{Mnk}[9th]{Improved Evasion}[Ex]
The monk's evasion ability improves.
If the monk resists an attack against her Reflex defense, she ignores all effects of the attack, even if it would normally have effects on a miss.
Like evasion, improved evasion can be used only if a monk is \unencumbered.
A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.

\cf{Mnk}[10th]{Improved Uncanny Dodge}[Ex]

The monk becomes immune to hostile mind-affecting effects.

\cf{Mnk}[19th]{Greater Bodily Perfection}
The bonus granted by the monk's bodily perfection ability increases to \plus3.

The monk becomes inhumanly perfect.
If she rolls less than a 5 on any d20 roll, it is treated as a 5.
In addition, she is treated as an outsider rather than as a humanoid for the purpose of spells and magical effects whenever doing so is advantageous to her.

\subsubsection{Ex-Monks}
A monk who becomes chaotic loses her \ki powers, and cannot gain more levels as a monk.
She retains all her other class features.
If she stops being chaotic, she regains her \ki powers and ability to take monk levels.

\end{dtable}

\subcf{Master of the Hunt}

The bonus his allies get is considered an enhancement bonus, and they do not suffer penalties against targets other than the quarry.

\subcf{Scent}
The ranger gains scent.


\subcf{6th -- Improved Combat Style}
The ranger increases his skill in the traditional ranger combat styles.
He can add half his Perception to damage in place of half Strength when using ranged attacks or when attacking with two weapons at once.
Natural weapons qualify for this purpose if the ranger attacks with two natural weapons at once.

The ranger must have the combat style lore to select this lore.
The benefits of this lore apply only when the ranger is \unencumbered.

\subcf{9th -- Hail of Arrows}
A number of times per day equal to 1 \add half the ranger's Constitution, he may take a full-round action to fire a single projectile at every enemy within a \areamed radius.
All enemies must be within one range increment of the ranger.
This lore can be used with any projectile weapon that the ranger can reload as a free action.

\subcf{9th -- Storm of Blades}

The ranger's abilities with traditional ranger combat styles improves again.
He gains the Two-Weapon Rend and Manyshot feats if he meets the prerequisites (see \featref{Two-Weapon Rend} and \featref{Manyshot}).
He must have the improved combat style lore to choose this lore.
The benefits of this lore only apply if the ranger is \unencumbered.

\subcf{12th -- Improved Evasion}
If the ranger resists an attack against his Reflex defense, he ignores all effects of the attack, even if it would normally have effects on a miss.
Like evasion, improved evasion can be used only if a ranger is \unencumbered.
A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.
The ranger must have the evasion lore to choose this lore.

\subcf{15th -- Combat Style Mastery}
The ranger's abilities with traditional ranger combat styles reach their peak.
When using a ranged weapon, he can take a move action to study the weak points of a foe within one range increment.
If he does, the next attack he makes against that foe is made against Reflex defense, if it is made within 1 round.
When wielding two weapons at once, he gains the pounce ability, allowing him to take a full attack action at the end of a charge.

The ranger must have the greater combat style lore to choose this lore.
The benefits apply only if the ranger is \unencumbered.

\cf{Rgr}[4th]{Low-light Vision}[Ex]
The ranger's sight improves, allowing him to see in conditions of dim light more easily.
He gains low-light vision, allowing him to treat sources of light as if they had double their normal illumination range.
If he already has low-light vision, he doubles its benefit, allowing him to treat sources of light as if they had four times their normal illumination range.

\cf{Rgr}[4th]{Tracking Expert}[Ex]
The ranger's ability to track his foes improves.
He may always take 10 on Survival checks made to track, even if conditions would otherwise prevent this.
Additionally, he can move at his normal speed while following tracks without taking the normal \minus5 penalty.
He takes only a \minus10 penalty (instead of the normal \minus20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.

\cf{Rgr}[5th]{Free Stride}[Ex]
The ranger can move through any sort of natural terrain that slows or impedes movement at his normal speed without suffering any sort of impairment.
If a skill check, such as Climb or Swim, would normally be required to move through the terrain, this ability does not help.

\cf{Rgr}[5th]{Tenacious Hunter}[Ex]
The ranger's ability to pursue his quarry improves.
He adds his quarry bonus to his defenses against attacks that his quarry makes.

\cf{Rgr}[7th]{Guide}[Ex]
Whenever the ranger is in his favored terrain, all allies that can see and hear the ranger gain his favored terrain bonuses in that terrain as well.

\cf{Rgr}[8th]{Darkvision}[Ex]
The ranger's sight improves again, and he gains the ability to see even when there is no light at all.
He gains darkvision out to 50 feet, allowing him to see in complete darkness.
If he already has darkvision, he increases its range by 50 feet.

\cf{Rgr}[10th]{Favored Terrain (Planar)}[Ex]
The ranger may choose any plane as a favored terrain in addition to his normal options whenever he gains a new favored terrain.
He is immune to any hostile planar effects from any plane he has chosen as favored terrain.
In addition, he gains a \plus2 bonus to Knowledge checks relating to the plane and is always treated as trained in Knowledge (planar) for the purpose of such checks.

\cf{Rgr}[11th]{Hidden Hunter}[Su]
The ranger becomes even more difficult for his quarry to detect.
He adds his quarry bonus to his Stealth checks against his quarry.
In addition, he continuously benefits from the effect of the \spell{nondectection} spell against all attempts that his quarry makes to detect him magically.
The effect uses a spellpower equal to his ranger level or Perception.

\cf{Rgr}[12th]{Blindsense}[Ex]
The ranger's perceptions are so finely honed that he can sense his enemies without seeing them.
He gains the blindsense ability out to 50 feet.
This ability allows him to sense the presence and location of objects and foes within 50 feet without seeing them.
If he already has the blindsense ability, he increases its range by 50 feet.

\cf{Rgr}[13th]{Terrain Mastery}[Ex]
The ranger gains a greater degree of mastery over some of his favored terrains.
He chooses a single kind of terrain that he has already chosen as a favored terrain.
At his 17th ranger level, he chooses an additional kind of terrain to master.
\par While in that terrain, his bonuses on Awareness, Stealth, and Survival checks increase to \plus4.
In addition, he gains another ability based on that terrain that is constantly active, whether or not he is currently in the terrain.
The options for terrain masteries are given below.

\cf{Rgr}[16th]{Blindsight}[Ex]
The ranger gains the ability to ``see'' perfectly without his eyes in a 50 foot radius around him.
With this ability, he can fight just as well with his eyes closed as with them open.
If he already has the blindsight ability, he increases its range by 50 feet.

\cf{Rgr}[17th]{Unerring Hunter}[Su]
The ranger's ability to hunt down his quarry improves to supernatural levels.
Once per day, the ranger may concentrate for a full round to duplicate the effects of the \spell{discern location} spell targeted at his quarry.

\cf{Rgr}[17th]{Hide in Plain Sight}[Ex]
While in any of his favored terrains, the ranger can use the Stealth skill to hide even while being observed, taking a \minus5 penalty to the Stealth check.
He still needs cover or concealment to hide.

If the ranger has the Camouflage ranger lore (see \pcref{Camouflage}), this allows the ranger to attempt to hide in almost any situation, as long as he is in one of his favored terrains.

\cf{Rgr}[19th]{Perfect Stride}[Su]
The ranger's ability to surpass obstacles becomes unparalleled.
He constantly acts as if he were under the effect of a \spell{freedom} spell, except that it does not allow him to act normally underwater.

\cf{Rgr}[20th]{Truesight}[Su]
The ranger's perceptions are accurate enough to defeat even powerful magic.
He gains the ability to see all things as they actually are, as the \spell{true seeing} spell, out to a range of 50 feet.

\sssecfake{Class Skills}
The rogue's class skills (and the key attribute for each skill) are
Climb (Str), Jump (Str), Sprint (Str), Swim (Str), Balance (Dex), Escape Artist (Dex),  Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Tumble (Dex), Craft (Int), Devices (Int), Disguise (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Awareness (Per), Sense Motive (Per), Intimidate (Varies), Bluff (\x), Persuasion (\x), and Perform (\x).

\cf{Rog}{Skill Points}
15.

\sssecfake{Class Features}
All of the following are class features of the rogue.

\cf{Rog}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
Rogues are proficient with simple weapons, any two weapon groups, light armor, and bucklers.
They are also proficient with saps.

\cf{Rog}{Sneak Attack}
If a rogue can catch an opponent when it is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.
She can choose to deal 1d6 points of extra damage if the target is unaware or is suffering overwhelm penalties from being surrounded by enemies (see \pcref{Overwhelm}).

This extra damage is only dealt the first time that the rogue makes a successful sneak attack against that particular creature in the encounter.
Additional sneak attacks against the same creature deal no additional damage.

The extra damage increases by 1d6 at her 3rd rogue level and every two rogue levels thereafter.
Unlike most damage bonuses, this extra damage is not multiplied if the rogue scores a critical hit.

\par Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.
A rogue can't strike with deadly accuracy from beyond that range.

With a sap (blackjack) or an unarmed strike, a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage.
She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual \minus4 penalty.

A rogue can only sneak attack creatures with a discernible body structure -- oozes, incorporeal creatures, and some plants lack vital areas to attack.
Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks.
The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot.
A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach.

\cf{Rog}[2nd]{Skill Talent}[Ex]
The rogue's skills improve.
She gains an additional skill point, which she can place in any skill, and a bonus skill feat for which she qualifies.
At her 6th rogue level, and every four rogue levels thereafter, she gains an additional skill point and skill feat.

\cf{Rog}[3rd]{Survival Trick}
The rogue gains a trick to help her survive.
She chooses a single survival trick from the list below.
Some survival tricks have minimum rogue levels, as indicated in the title of the ability.
At her 7th rogue level, and every four rogue levels thereafter, the rogue gains an additional survival trick.

All survival tricks are extraordinary abilities unless otherwise noted.

\subcf{Evasion}
If the rogue resists an attack against her Reflex defense that normally deals half damage when resisted, she instead takes no damage.
Evasion can be used only if a rogue is \unencumbered.
A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.

\subcf{Uncanny Dodge}
The rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so.
The rogue reduces her overwhelm penalties by 1.
If her overwhelm penalty is reduced to 0, she is not considered to be overwhelmed.
In addition, she is not \unaware when attacked by surprise.

\subcf{7th -- Defensive Roll}
As an immediate action, whenever the rogue takes damage from a physical attack, she can attempt to roll with the blow.
If the damage dealt is less than her Reflex defense, she takes half damage from the attack, and the damage is nonlethal.
This applies after all other effects that reduce damage, such as damage reduction.
However, the rogue also falls \prone.
The rogue must be aware of the attack to use this ability.

\subcf{7th -- Slippery Mind}
Whenever an attack for a Mind spell or effect beats the rogue's Mental defense by less than 5, she is affected normally at first.
One round later, the rogue is instead affected as if the attack had failed.
This does not help against instantaneous effects.

\subcf{11th -- Improved Evasion}
If the rogue resists an attack against her Reflex defense, she ignores all effects of the attack, even if it would normally have effects on a miss.
Like evasion, improved evasion can be used only if a rogue is \unencumbered.
A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.
The rogue must have the evasion survival trick to choose this survival trick.

\subcf{11th -- Improved Uncanny Dodge}
The rogue reduces her overwhelm penalties by 2.
This does not stack with the effects of uncanny dodge.
If her overwhelm penalty is reduced to 0, she is not considered to be overwhelmed.
The rogue must have the uncanny dodge survival trick to choose this survival trick.

\cf{Rog}[4th]{Combat Tricks}
The rogue gains a combat trick to aid her and confound her foes.
She chooses a single combat trick from the list below.
Some combat tricks have minimum rogue levels, as indicated in the title of the ability.
At her 8th rogue level, and every four rogue levels thereafter, the rogue gains an additional combat trick.

Some combat tricks depend on a rogue's trick power.
A rogue's trick power is equal to her Intelligence or her rogue level, whichever is higher.

Tricks marked with an asterisk are called ambush attacks.
Ambush attacks only function on the first sneak attack the rogue makes against a particular creature in an encounter.

All combat tricks are extraordinary abilities unless otherwise noted.

\subcf{Combat Feat}
The rogue gains a combat feat for which she qualifies (see Feats).
This trick can be selected multiple times.

\subcf{Distracting Attack}
Whenever the rogue successfully sneak attacks a creature, the struck creature takes a penalty to Concentration checks until the end of the round.
The penalty is equal to the number of sneak attack dice the rogue rolled on the attack.
This penalty does not stack with itself.

\subcf{Dispelling Ambush (Su)*}
A creature damaged by this ambush attack is affected by \spell{dispel magic}.
The rogue's spellpower for this ability is equal to her trick power.
This is an ambush attack, and only works once per creature.

\subcf{Distant Precision}
The rogue can make sneak attacks from up to 100 feet away.

\subcf{Hamstring*}
A creature damaged by this ambush attack has its land speed halved for 5 rounds.
Despite the name, this can be used on creatures who do not have hamstrings.

\subcf{Merciful Blows}
The rogue suffers no penalty to physical attacks when attacking for nonlethal damage, and can deal her full sneak attack damage when attacking nonlethally.

%\subcf{Swift Poisoner}
%The rogue can apply poison to a weapon she is holding as a swift action.

\subcf{Tricky Maneuver}
When performing a maneuver against a creature she would be able to sneak attack, the rogue gains a bonus to attack equal to the number of sneak attack dice she would roll.
The benefits of this trick apply even against creatures immune to critical hits.

\subcf{8th -- Brutal Ambush*}
The rogue rolls d8s instead of d6s for her sneak attack dice on this ambush attack.

\subcf{8th -- Spellstealing Ambush*}
A creature damaged by this ambush attack is affected by \spell{spelltheft}.
The rogue's spellpower for this ability is equal to her trick power.

\subcf{8th -- Staggering Ambush*}
The rogue makes a special attack against the Fortitude defense of the creature struck by this ambush attack.
Her attack bonus is equal to her trick power.
If the special attack succeeds, the struck creature is \staggered for 5 rounds.

\subcf{12th -- Assassination}
To use this ability, the rogue must spend a full round studying a creature within 100 feet of her who has not noticed her and who is not in combat.
If she make a melee sneak attack against that target within 1 round, her attack deals maximum damage, including her sneak attack damage.
If the target becomes aware of her presence before she attacks, this ability has no benefit.

\subcf{12th -- Confusing Ambush*}
The rogue makes a special attack against the Mental defense of the creature struck by this ambush attack.
Her attack bonus is equal to her trick power.
If the special attack succeeds, the struck creature is \disoriented for 5 rounds.
If it critically succeeds, the struck creature is instead \confused for 5 rounds.

\subcf{12th -- Perfect Precision}
The rogue has no range limit on her sneak attacks.
She must have the distant precision combat trick to gain this trick.

\subcf{12th -- Spellreaving Ambush (Su)*}
All spells and magical effects on the creature struck by this ambush attack are dispelled.
Spells and effects that cannot be removed by \spell{dispel magic} are unaffected.
The rogue must have the dispelling ambush combat trick to choose this combat trick.

\subcf{16th -- Dazing Ambush*}
A creature damaged by this ambush attack is \dazed for 5 rounds.

\subcf{16th -- Deadly Ambush*}
The rogue makes a special attack against the Fortitude defense of the creature struck by this ambush attack.
Her attack bonus is equal to her trick power.
If the special attack succeeds, the struck creature is \staggered for 5 rounds.
If it critically succeeds, the struck creature immediately dies.

\subcf{16th -- Paralyzing Ambush*}
The rogue makes a special attack against the Fortitude defense of the creature struck by this ambush attack.
Her attack bonus is equal to her trick power.
If the special attack succeeds, the struck creature is \staggered for 5 rounds.
If it critically succeeds, the struck creature is \paralyzed for 5 rounds.

%\subcf{16th -- Opportunist} Once per round, the rogue can make an attack of opportunity against a creature that has just taken physical damage from another creature's attack.
%This attack counts as one of the rogue's attacks of opportunity for that round.

\subcf{20th -- Dual Ambush}
The rogue can apply the benefits of two ambush attacks to a single sneak attack.

\subcf{20th -- Lingering Ambush}
The effects of the rogue's ambush attacks last ten times longer than normal.
This has no effect on ambush attacks that have no duration.

\cf{Rog}[5th]{Skill Exemplar}[Ex]
The rogue gains a \plus5 bonus with a single skill of her choice.
At her 9th rogue level, and every four rogue levels thereafter, she may gain this bonus with an additional skill.

\cf{Rog}[6th]{Persistent Sneak Attack}[Ex]
The rogue learns how to strike vital spots more consistently.
She gains half her sneak attack dice (rounded down) when making sneak attacks against a creature she has already successfully dealt sneak attack damage to in the encounter.
For example, a 6th level rogue would deal 3d6 points of extra damage on her first sneak attack against a creature, and 1d6 points of damage on every subsequent sneak attack against the same creature.
This does not allow her to deliver ambush attacks to the same creature multiple times.

\cf{Rog}[20th]{Endless Sneak Attack}[Ex]
The rogue deals full sneak attack damage on her first successful sneak each round against the same creature, rather than only on her first sneak attack in the encounter against that creature.
This does not allow her to deliver ambush attacks to the same creature multiple times.

\sssecfake{Class Skills}
The sorcerer's class skills (and the key attribute for each skill) are Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (the planes), Spellcraft (Per), Intimidate (Varies), Bluff (\x), and Persuasion (\x).

\cf{Sor}{Skill Points}
5.

\sssecfake{Class Features}
All of the following are class features of the sorcerer.

\cf{Sor}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
Sorcerers are proficient with simple weapons  and one other weapon group.
They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield.
Armor of any type interferes with a sorcerer's arcane gestures, which can cause his spells with somatic components to fail.

\cf{Sor}{Spells}
A sorcerer casts arcane spells using his Willpower.
The maximum spell level a sorcerer can learn or cast is equal to half his sorcerer level (minimum 1) or half his Willpower, whichever is lower.
A sorcerer's spellpower is equal to his sorcerer level or Willpower, whichever is higher.

At 1st level, the sorcerer knows one 1st level spell.
At every level thereafter, the sorcerer learns one additional spell.
The spell can be of any level, up to a maximum of half the sorcerer's class level.
A sorcerer's spells are drawn from the unrestricted spells on the arcane spell list (see \pcref{Arcane Spells}).

Sorcerers do not have a limit on the number of spells they can cast each day.
Their ability to cast spells is limited by their lack of control over their magic.
See Wild Magic, below, for details.

\cf{Sor}{Wild Magic}[Ex]
Every time a sorcerer casts a spell, he must make a wild magic roll.
To make a wild magic roll, roll d20 and add the spell's level.
The DC of the roll is equal to 10 \add 1 per two sorcerer levels.
Failure means the spell is cast normally.
Success means the sorcerer miscasts the spell (see \pcref{Miscasting}).

If the sorcerer miscasts a spell with this ability, he cannot cast spells of the same level as the miscast spell for 10 minutes per spell level.
This roll is not an attack or check, and is not modified by abilities that affect attacks or checks.
On a natural 20, the spell is always miscast, regardless of other modifiers.

\cf{Sor}{Cantrip}
Cantrips are minor spell-like abilities which do not require effort to use.
A sorcerer chooses one cantrip from the list of cantrips on \pref{Cantrip List}.
He may use the cantrip at will.
Cantrips cannot be miscast, and are not affected by the sorcerer's wild magic ability.

At his 2nd sorcerer level, the sorcerer learns a second cantrip of his choice.

\cf{Sor}[2nd]{Spellsurge}
The sorcerer learns how to alter how he casts spells by initiating a spellsurge.
He can initiate a spellsurge as a swift action.
While in a spellsurge, he gains bonuses with some types of magic or aspects of spellcasting, but takes penalties to others.
A spellsurge lasts for 5 rounds.
A sorcerer can attempt to end a spellsurge as a swift action by testing Mental defense against a test bonus equal to his spellpower (including any bonuses or penalties from the spellsurge that affect all spells).
Success means he ends the spellsurge, and failure means his attempt has no effect.

The value of the numerical bonuses and penalties granted by a sorcerer's spellsurge is called his spellsurge bonus.
Initially, his spellsurge bonus is \plus2, granting him \plus2 bonuses and inflicting \minus2 penalties.
A sorcerer can initiate a spellsurge a number of times per day equal to his spellsurge bonus.
His spellsurge bonus improves to \plus3 at his 8th sorcerer level, to \plus4 at 14th sorcerer level, and finally to \plus5 at 20th sorcerer level.

At his 6th sorcerer level, and every four sorcerer levels thereafter, the sorcerer learns an additional spellsurge.
Some spellsurges have minimum sorcerer levels, as indicated in the title of the ability.
The list of spellsurges is given below.
All spellsurges are extraordinary abilities unless otherwise specified.

\subcf{Brilliant Surge}
The sorcerer gains a bonus to his spellpower with light spells, but takes a penalty to his spellpower with Illusion spells.
\subcf{Empathic Surge}
The sorcerer gains a bonus to spellpower with mind-affecting spells, but takes a penalty to Mental defense and to spellpower with spells that deal damage.
\subcf{Energetic Surge}
The sorcerer gains a bonus to spellpower with acid, cold, electricity, and fire spells, but takes a penalty to his spellpower with other spells.
\subcf{6th -- Focused Surge}
The sorcerer gains a bonus to his concentration checks, but takes a penalty to his spellpower with all spells.
\subcf{6th -- Patient Surge}
The sorcerer gains a bonus to his spellpower with all spells, but all spells he casts require at least a full-round action to cast.
This does not increase the casting time of spells with a casting time of a full-round action or longer.
\subcf{10th -- Extending Surge}
The sorcerer doubles the range on all his spells, but takes a penalty to his spellpower with all spells.
\subcf{10th -- Silent Surge}
The sorcerer can cast spells as if they did not have verbal components, but takes a penalty to his spellpower with all spells.
\subcf{10th -- Stilled Surge}
The sorcerer can cast spells as if they did not have somatic components, but takes a penalty to his spellpower with all spells.

\subcf{14th -- Lifebound Surge}
The sorcerer gains a bonus to his spellpower with all spells, but takes 1 point of Constitution damage each time he casts a spell.
\subcf{14th -- Lingering Surge}
The sorcerer gains a bonus to his spellpower with spells that have a non-instantaneous duration, but takes a penalty to spellpower with spells that are instantaneous.
\subcf{18th -- Widening Surge}
The sorcerer doubles the area affected by his spells that affect an area, but takes a penalty to his spellpower with all spells.

\cf{Sor}[3rd]{Improved Wild Magic}[Ex]
When the sorcerer miscasts a spell or spellblend with his wild magic ability, the normal effects of the spell (or spells) take place in addition to any miscast effects.
This does not affect spells the sorcerer miscasts for other reasons, such as if his concentration is broken.

\cf{Sor}[5th]{Defensive Spellblend}[Ex]
The sorcerer may combine his cantrips with his spells.
As a full-round action, the sorcerer may cast a spell that affects only himself.
The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less.
If he does, he may also use a cantrip as part of the same action.
The cantrip need not target the sorcerer.
In exchange, he gains a \plus5 bonus to his wild magic roll.
The spell's level is used to determine the bonus to the sorcerer's wild magic roll.
If the sorcerer miscasts the spellblend with his wild magic ability, the cantrip still takes effect normally.


\cf{Sor}[7th]{Arcane Resilience}[Ex]
The sorcerer gains damage reduction equal to his sorcerer level or Constitution against arcane spells.
This allows him to ignore the first points of physical damage he takes each round.
This ability applies against the sorcerer's own miscast effects.

\cf{Sor}[9th]{Offensive Spellblend}[Ex]
This ability functions like defensive spellblend, except that the spell need not only affect the sorcerer.

\cf{Sor}[11th]{Spell Resistance}[Ex]
Repeated exposure to magic grants the sorcerer resistance to magical effects.
The sorcerer gains spell resistance equal to 10 \add sorcerer level or Constitution.
To affect the sorcerer with a spell, a caster must make an attack with its spellpower.
If the attack beats the sorcerer's spell resistance, the spell works normally.
Otherwise, the spell has no effect on the sorcerer.

This ability does not affect the sorcerer's own miscast effects.

\cf{Sor}[13th]{Improved Defensive Spellblend}[Ex]
The sorcerer may combine two spells together.
As a full-round action, the sorcerer may cast two spells at once, resolving each spell's effects separately.
The spells cast in this way must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less, and must be at least three spell levels apart, such as a 1st-level spell and a 4th-level spell.
In addition, one of the two spells must affect only the sorcerer.
In exchange, he gains a \plus5 bonus to his wild magic roll.
The level of the higher level spell is used to determine the bonus to the sorcerer's wild magic roll.

\cf{Sor}[17th]{Improved Offensive Spellblend}[Ex]
This ability functions like improved defensive spellblend, except that neither spell need only affect the sorcerer.

\cf{Sor}[19th]{Endless Surge}[Ex]
There is no limit to the duration of a sorcerer's spellsurge ability.
If a spellsurge lasts longer than 5 rounds, he automatically succeeds on any Concentration check he makes to end the surge.

\cf{Sor}[20th]{Greater Wild Magic}[Ex]
When the sorcerer miscasts a spell or spellblend with his wild magic ability, the normal effects of the spell or spellblend take place twice, as if he had cast it twice.

The spellwarped can maintain the full power of his innate magic without limit.
He can gain the effects of his surge of power indefinitely.
He may toggle the ability on or off as a swift action at will, without expending spellwarp points.

The weapon is sized appropriately for him, and may take the form of any weapon he is proficient with.
He can attack with the weapon as if it were a normal weapon of its type, except that he adds half his Willpower to damage in place of half his Strength, and all damage dealt with the weapon is fire damage.
\par The flame weapon gains a \plus1 enhancement bonus to attack and damage at 4th spellwarped level.
At his 7th level, and every 3 spellwarped levels thereafter, the bonus increases by 1.
If it leaves his hand, it is extinguished 1 round later.
\parhead{4th -- Ignite}
This attack functions like the lesser ignite attack, except that it deals 1d10 points of fire damage per two spellwarped levels, and a successful attack also makes the target \ignited.
\parhead{6th -- Ignite Weapon}
As a swift action, the spellwarped can set one of his weapon on fire for 5 rounds.
During this time, the spellwarped can add half his Willpower to damage with the weapon he wields in place of half his Strength.
This bonus damage is fire damage.
%If ignites a weapon created using his weapon of flame power, he adds his full Charisma to damage with the weapon instead of half his Charisma.
\parhead{6th -- Fiery Protection}
As a standard action, the spellwarped can bestow fire and cold damage reduction equal to twice his spellwarped level on a creature within 30 feet of him.
The protection lasts for 1 hour.
\parhead{8th -- Conflagration}
As a standard action, the spellwarped can release a powerful explosion of flame.
He makes a Reflex attack to deal damage to all enemies and objects within a \areamed radius spread of him.
This attack deals 1d6 fire damage per two spellwarped levels.
A failed attack deals half damage.
\parhead{10th -- Fire Shield}
As a standard action, the spellwarped can wreath himself in flame for 5 rounds.
Any creature that hits him with its body or a melee weapon takes 1d6 fire damage per two spellwarped levels.
Each individual creature can take this damage only once per round.
\parhead{10th -- Flameheart}
As a standard action, the spellwarped can become a being of pure fire for 1 round.
In this form, he is immune to physical damage and can pass through openings as small as one inch at no movement penalty.
However, he cannot attack normally or use any of his items, as they meld into his body.
He may invoke any of his spellwarped powers normally.
In this form, he can make a touch attack as a standard action to deal 1d6 points of fire damage per spellwarped level.
\parhead{12th -- Firestride}
As a move action, the spellwarped can may teleport to any active flame of at least Tiny size within \rngmed range.
When he does so, he immolates himself and disappears into a pile of ash before stepping out from the flame unharmed.
An ordinary torch is sufficient flame to teleport to, but not a candle.
\parhead{14th -- Flight of the Phoenix}
As a swift action, the spellwarped can spend two spellwarp points to fly on wings of flame for 5 rounds.
His fly speed is equal to his base land speed, and his maneuverability is good.
See \pcref{Flying}, for more details.
At the end of the duration, the wings are extinguished.
This ability is draining to use, and the spellwarped must wait for five minutes after using it before he can use it again.
\parhead{14th -- Greater Flameheart}
This power functions like the flameheart power, except that it lasts for 5 rounds.
\parhead{16th -- }

\parhead{18th -- Phoenix Revival}
When the spellwarped takes critical damage, he may spend five spellwarp points as an immediate action, even if the critical damage would be sufficient to kill him.
If he does, he ignores the critical damage he just took and dissolves into a pile of ash for 5 rounds.
During this time, he can take no actions.
If the pile of ash remains intact after 5 rounds, the spellwarped is restored to his normal body, with zero hit points but with all critical damage healed.
However, if the pile of ash is dispersed, the spellwarped dies.
The ash cannot be harmed by fire damage, and if the pile of ash would take at least 10 points of fire damage during a round, the spellwarped returns one round sooner.
The spellwarped may take his normal actions immediately after being restored.
\parhead{20th -- Immolate}
As a standard action, the spellwarped makes a special attack vs. Fortitude against a foe within \rngclose range to consume it in flames from the inside out.
This attack deals 1d10 points of fire damage per two spellwarped levels, and if the creature is \bloodied after it takes this damage, it immediately dies.
A failed attack deals half damage and leaves a bloodied creature with 0 hit points.

\subsubsection{Telekinesis Powers}
\parhead{1st -- Lesser Crush}
As a standard action, the spellwarped makes a special attack vs. Fortitude against a creature within \rngclose range.
If his attack succeeds, he crushes it with telekinetic force for 1d6 points of physical damage \add 1 per spellwarped level.
A failed attack deals half damage.
\parhead{1st -- Mind Blade}
As a swift action, the spellwarped can telekinetically wield an unattended weapon within \rngclose range for 5 rounds.
The weapon must be a light or medium weapon appropriate for his size.
This allows him to attack with the weapon just as if he were holding it in one hand, except that he uses his Intelligence in place of his Strength.
In all other respects, this functions as if he were wielding the weapon normally, including contributing to overwhelm penalties.
The weapon floats in midair and threatens all squares adjacent to it.
As a move action, he may move the weapon up to 30 feet in any direction, even vertically.
If the weapon goes outside of \rngclose range, he loses control of it and it falls to the ground.
\parhead{4th -- Crush}
This power functions like the lesser crush attack, except that it deals 1d10 points of physical damage per two spellwarped levels.
In addition, if his attack succeeds, the target is also \sickened for 5 rounds.
\parhead{4th -- Mighty Mind Blade}
This power functions like the mind blade power, except that the spellwarped may also use a heavy weapon appropriate for his size, allowing him to attack with it just as if he were holding it in two hands.
The spellwarped must have the mind blade power to select this power.
\parhead{6th -- Distant Manipulation}
As a standard action, the spellwarped can mentally exert influence at up to \rngclose range.
This allows him to take any standard action which he could normally take with his hands, using his Intelligence in place of his Strength or Dexterity, as appropriate.
He may take actions that require more than a standard action to complete by spending the same amount of time concentrating, spending one spellwarp point per two rounds that he spends concentrating.
\subcf{6th -- Dual Mind Blade}
This power functions like his mind blade power, except that the spellwarped may wield two weapons at once.
They must stay in the same space, and he may make two-weapon fighting attacks with the weapons, just as if he was wielding them with two hands.
The spellwarped must have the mind blade power to select this power.
\parhead{8th -- }
\parhead{10th -- Telekinetic Force} This power functions like the \spell{telekinetic force}
spell, using his Intelligence as his casting attribute.
\parhead{12th -- Strangle}
As a standard action, the spellwarped can make a special attack vs. Fortitude against a creature within \rngclose range to crush its windpipe.
This attack deals 1d10 damage per two spellwarped levels.
If the target is \bloodied after the damage is dealt, it is nauseated for 1 round.
A failed attack deals half damage, and prevents the foe from being nauseated.
This power costs two spellwarp points.
\parhead{14th -- }
\parhead{16th -- }

\parhead{18th -- }
\parhead{20th -- Mass Strangle}
This power functions like the strangle power, except that it costs three spellwarp points and the spellwarped can affect any creatures within a \areasmall radius.

\subsubsection{Temporal Powers}
\parhead{1st -- Lesser Timetheft}
As a standard action, the spellwarped can attempt to steal time.
He makes a special attack against the Mental defense of an adjacent creature to force it to skip an action.
If it is \bloodied, it skips a standard action, while if it is healthy, it skips a move action.
\parhead{4th -- Slow}
As a standard action, the spellwarped makes a special attack against the Mental defense of a creature within \rngclose range, making it \slowed for 5 rounds.
\parhead{4th -- Timetheft}
This power functions like lesser timetheft, except that the spellwarped regains a spellwarp point if the attack is successful.
\parhead{6th -- Flashstep}
As a standard action, the spellwarped can accelerate a creature within \rngclose range so much that he can seem to pause time for everyone but the subject.
This allows the target to immediately take a single move action.
During this move action, the target cannot be followed or withdrawn from, and may move through squares occupied by creatures or threatened by blocking enemies without penalty.
The target still suffers the effects of any environmental hazards.
If the spellwarped uses this power on himself, it only requires a move action to activate.
\parhead{6th -- Disjointed Time}
As a standard action, the spellwarped makes a special attack vs. Fortitude against a single creature within \rngmed range to chaotically disrupt its local flow of time.
If the attack succeeds, the creature takes a \minus4 penalty to attacks, defenses, and checks for 5 rounds.
\parhead{8th -- Haste} This power functions like the \spell{haste}
spell.
\parhead{8th -- Temporal Prison}
As a standard action, the spellwarped makes a special attack against the Mental defense of a single creature within \rngclose range to completely stop time for it for 5 rounds.
The affected creature can take no actions and cannot be moved, damaged, or even affected in any way until the effect ends.
The spellwarped may dismiss the effect as a swift action.

The spellwarped can only affect any individual creature with this ability once per 24 hours.
\parhead{10th -- Slow, Greater}
As a standard action, the spellwarped can spend two spellwarp points to make a creature within \rngmed range \slowed.
\parhead{10th -- Flashstep, Greater}
This power functions like the flashstep power, except that it costs two spellwarp points and can be used as a move action.
If the spellwarped uses this power on himself, it only requires a swift action to activate.
\parhead{12th -- Timetheft, Greater}
This power functions like the timetheft power, except that it costs two spellwarp points and does not require a special attack.
\parhead{12th -- Timestream}
The spellwarped manipulates time in a \arealarge, 10 ft.
wide line that extends out from him for 5 rounds.
All creatures and objects that pass through the line are \slowed for 1 round.
The spellwarped can exclude his allies from the effect.
The timestream is virtually invisible, requiring a DC 30 Awareness check to notice in a clear environment, though objects passing through the effect can make it more obvious.
\parhead{14th -- Inhuman Speed}
As a move action, the spellwarped can accelerate himself to immense speed, allowing him to move up to five times his speed.
During this time, he cannot be followed or withdrawn from, can move through squares occupied by enemies or threatened by blocking enemies without penalty, and can treat liquids as if they were solid ground.
\parhead{14th -- Mass Slow}
This power functions like the slow power, except that it costs two spellwarp points and affects up to five creatures within \rngclose range of the spellwarped.
\parhead{16th -- Time Reversal}
As a swift action, the spellwarped can spend a spellwarp point to create a ``time lock.'' The time lock persists for one round.
As a standard action, he can make a special attack against the Mental defense of a creature within \rngmed range to bring it backwards through time to the point at which the time lock was created.
An affected creature is perfectly restored to the point immediately after the time lock was created.
The effects of any actions that the creature took in the intervening time are undone, any damage it dealt or took is removed, it is restored to its original location, and the creature is restored in all other ways, just as if the intervening time had never occured.
The spellwarped cannot reverse time for himself in this way.
\parhead{16th -- Supreme Acceleration}
As a standard action, the spellwarped can spend three spellwarp points to accelerate himself so much that he can take an additional round of actions immediately.
During this round, all creatures he attacks are treated as helpless, but he cannot perform a coup de grace or similar ability; such an act requires more care and precision than is possible with such immense speed.
After using this ability, he must wait 5 rounds before he can use it again.
\parhead{18th -- Mass Haste}
This power functions like the haste power, except that it costs two spellwarp points and affects up to five creatures within \rngclose range of the spellwarped.
\parhead{18th -- Time Stop}
As a standard action, the spellwarped can spend two spellwarp points to step into an alternate timestream, causing him to speed up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen.
He can act for 1d3\plus1 rounds of apparent time.
During this time, all objects and creatures are frozen in place and are completely invulnerable to the spellwarped, though he may affect them with spellwarped powers normally.
After using this ability, he must wait 5 rounds before he can use it again.
\parhead{20th -- Temporal Prison, Greater}
As a standard action, the spellwarped can spend two spellwarp points to completely stop time for a single creature for 5 rounds.
This functions like the temporal prison power, except that no attack is required.

\cd{Alignment} Any.

\sssecfake{Class Skills}
The wizard's class skills (and the key attribute for each skill) are
Knowledge (all skills, taken individually) (Int), Linguistics (Int), and Spellcraft (Per).

\cf{Wiz}{Skill Points}
5.

\sssecfake{Class Features}

All of the following are class features of the wizard.

\cf{Wiz}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
Wizards are proficient with simple weapons, but not with any type of armor or shield.
Armor of any type interferes with a wizard's movements, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.

\cf{Wiz}{Bonus Languages}
A wizard may learn Draconic in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race (see Chapter 2: Races).
Many ancient tomes of magic are written in Draconic, and apprentice wizards often learn it as part of their studies.

\cf{Wiz}{Spells}
A wizard casts arcane spells using her Intelligence.
To learn or cast a spell, a wizard must have an Intelligence at least equal to the spell's level.
A wizard's spellpower equals her wizard level or Intelligence, whichever is higher.

The number of spells a wizard knows is given on \trefnp{Wizard Spells Known}.
A wizard's spells are drawn from the common spells on the arcane spell list (see \pcref{Arcane Spells}).

The number of spells a wizard can cast per day is given on \trefnp{Wizard Spell Slots}.

In order to regain her spells for the day, a wizard must dismiss all her active spells and rest for 8 hours.
This rest does not have to involve sleep, but most wizards get this rest when they sleep for the night.

\cf{Wiz}{Rituals}
Wizards can perform rituals to create unique magical effects (see \pcref{Rituals}).
A wizard begins play with a ritual book containing two arcane rituals of her choice (see \pcref{Arcane Rituals}).

\cf{Wiz}{Specialization}
Some wizards choose to specialize in a particular school of magic.
Specialist wizards are able to learn all restricted spells from their chosen school, and gain additional spells known.
However, they can never access restricted spells from other schools, and must choose two other spell schools to ban.
A specialist wizard can never learn or cast spells or rituals from their banned schools.
Divination cannot be chosen as a banned school.

\cf{Wiz}{Cantrip}
Cantrips are minor spell-like abilities which do not require effort to use.
A wizard chooses one cantrip from the list of cantrips on \pref{Cantrip List}.
She may use the cantrip at will.
Cantrips cannot be miscast.
Specialist wizards must choose one of the cantrips granted by their specialist school.

At her 2nd wizard level, the wizard gains a second cantrip, which can be chosen from any non-prohibited school.

\cf{Wiz}[2nd]{Magic Feat}
The wizard gains a bonus magic feat or metamagic feat of her choice.
She must meet the prerequisites for the feat as normal.
At her 6th wizard level, and every 4 wizard levels thereafter, she gains an additional magic feat or metamagic feat.

\cf{Wiz}[3rd]{Arcane Insight}[Ex]
The wizard gains a greater understanding of magic.
A generalist wizard adds a restricted spell to her personal spell list.
The spell may be of any school, but she must still spend a spell known to learn it.

A specialist wizard gains an additional spell known.
The spell must be from her chosen school, including restricted spells.

In either case, the spell's level cannot exceed half her wizard level -- normally, the highest level of spells that she can cast.
At her 5th wizard level, and every odd wizard level thereafter, the wizard gains a new arcane insight.

\cf{Wiz}[4th]{Cantrip Sequencer}[Ex]
The wizard gains the ability to create a sequence of a spell and cantrip which she can cast together later.
To create an cantrip sequencer, the wizard must cast a spell which affects only herself and a cantrip, which may affect any target.
The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less.
Neither has any effect immediately.
The wizard may later use a full-round action to cast both the spell and the cantrip at once, choosing the target of the cantrip at that time.
\par The wizard may initially have only one sequencer active at any time.
At her 8th wizard level, and every 4 wizard levels thereafter, she may keep an additional sequencer active at once.
If she creates a new sequencer, it replaces one of her previous sequencers.
She may choose which old sequencer is replaced.

\cf{Wiz}[8th]{Defensive Sequencer}[Ex]
The wizard gains the ability to create a sequence of two spells which she can cast rapidly later.
To create a defensive sequencer, the wizard must cast two spells, one of which affects only herself.
The spells must be at least three levels apart, and both must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less.
Neither has any effect immediately.
The wizard may later use a full-round action to cast both spells at once, resolving their effects separately.
The number of sequencers a wizard may have active at once is limited, as described in the cantrip sequencer ability.

\cf{Wiz}[12th]{Contingency}[Ex]
The wizard gains the ability to prepare a spell so it takes effect automatically if specific circumstances arise.
To prepare a contingency, the wizard must spend 1 minute preparing the spell, which consumes the a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's level.
During this casting time, the wizard specifies what circumstances cause the spell to take effect.

The contingency can be set to trigger in response to any circumstances that a typical human observing the wizard and her situation could detect.
For example, a wizard could specify ``when I fall at least 50 feet'' or ``when I become bloodied,'' but not ``when there is an invisible creature within 50 feet of me'' or ``when I am at 17 hit points or fewer.'' The more specific the required circumstances, the better -- vague requirements, such as ``when I am in danger,'' may cause the contingency to trigger unexpectedly or fail to trigger at all.
If a wizard attempts to specify multiple separate triggering conditions, such as ``when I take damage or when an enemy is adjacent to me,'' the contingency will randomly ignore all but one of the conditions.

The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less, and it must target the wizard or have its area centered on the wizard.
Any spells which require decisions, such as \spell{dimension door}, must have those decisions made at the time the contingency is created.
The wizard cannot change those decisions when the contingency takes effect.

A wizard can have only one contingency active at a time.
If she creates another contingency, it replaces her old contingency.

\cf{Wiz}[16th]{Offensive Sequencer}[Ex]
The wizard gains the ability to create a sequence of two spells which she can cast rapidly later.
To create an offensive sequencer, the wizard must cast two spells.
The spells must be at least three levels apart, and both must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less.
One spell must be a damaging spell, and the other must not.
Neither has any effect immediately.
The wizard may later use a full-round action to cast both spells at once, resolving their effects separately.
The number of sequencers a wizard may have active at once is limited, as described in the cantrip sequencer ability.

\cf{Wiz}[20th]{Chain Contingency}[Ex]
The wizard may ready a sequencer in her contingency instead of a single spell.
This sequencer counts against her limit of available sequencers.

\section{Character Advancement}\label{Character Advancement}

As your character accomplishes challenges and defeats foes, he gains experience.
If your character has enough experience, he gains a level.
When you gain a level, you can increase your character's level in your current class or in any other class, and gain the benefits described for each class.
Rules for taking levels in multiple classes are described in \pref{Multiclass Characters}, below.

A character that increases in level gains additional benefits.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Every odd level, including 1st level, you a feat (see \pcref{Feats}).
    \item Every 5th level, you increases all of your attributes by one.
    \item At all other levels after 1st, you increase two different attributes of your choice by one.
    \item At 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a legend point.
\end{itemize}

If a character has multiple classes, these benefits are gained based on the total character level, not based on class level.
The experience required to reach a level, and the benefits gained at each level, are shown on \trefnp{Character Advancement}.

\section{Multiclass Characters}\label{Multiclass Characters}
A character may add new classes as he or she progresses in level, thus becoming a multiclass character.
The class abilities from a character's different classes combine to determine a multiclass character's overall abilities.
Multiclassing improves a character's versatility at the expense of focus.

\subsection{Class And Level Features}
As a general rule, the abilities of a multiclass character are the sum
of the abilities of each of the character's classes.

\parhead{Level}
``Character level'' is a character's total number of levels.
It is used to determine when feats and attribute score boosts are gained, as noted on \tref{Character Advancement}.
Whenever a creature's ``level'' is specified, without reference to a particular class, the character level is used.

\par ``Class level'' is a character's level in a particular class.
For a character whose levels are all in the same class, character level and class level are the same.

%TODO
\parhead{Hit Points}
A character gains hit points from each class as his or her class level increases, adding the new hit points to the previous total.

\parhead{Base Attack Bonus}
Add your character's levels in classes that grant the same base attack bonus progressions together, then sum those base attack bonuses to find your total base attack bonus.
If a character would have a higher base attack bonus by treating a level with an average base attack bonus progression as a level with a poor base attack bonus progression, he or she may do so.
For example, a rogue 1 / wizard 1 would have a base attack bonus of 1.

\par For example, a 2nd-level rogue/2nd-level wizard would have a \plus2 base attack bonus.
She would get a \plus1 base attack bonus from two levels in a class with average base attack bonus progression (rogue) and a \plus1 base attack bonus from two levels in a class with poor base attack bonus progression (wizard).
That gives a total base attack bonus of 1 \add 1, or \plus2.
In contrast, a 2nd-level rogue/2nd-level cleric would have a \plus3 base attack bonus, because she would have four levels in classes with average base attack bonus progression.

\parhead{Defenses}
Add your character's levels in classes that grant the same base defense bonus progressions together, then sum those base defense bonuses to find your total base defense bonus.

\par For example, a 3rd-level rogue/2nd-level ranger has a base Fortitude bonus of \plus5 (\plus1 from 3 levels in a class with a poor Fortitude defense and \plus4 from two levels in a class with a good Fortitude defense), a base Reflex bonus of \plus7 (from five levels in classes with good Reflex defenses), and a base Mental defense bonus of \plus2 (from five levels in classes with poor Mental defenses).

\parhead{Skills}
When taking the first level in a class, if that class gives more skill points than the most skill points the character already received from a class, the character immediately gets skill points equal to the difference.
For example, if a fighter took a level in rogue, he would immediately gain the difference between the rogue's 10 skill points and the fighter's 4 skill points, for a total of 6 new skill points.

\parhead{Class Features}
A multiclass character gets all the class features
of all his or her classes but must also suffer the consequences of the
special restrictions of all his or her classes.

\par In some cases, two classes can have virtually identical abilities.
Use the following guidelines to determine how abilities stack.
\begin{itemize}
    \item If two identical class features are not based on level and are not gained following a specific pattern, they do not stack.
    \item If two identical class features are not explicitly based on level, but both classes gain them in a predictable pattern, the levels of the two classes stack for determining when the next improvement to the class feature will be gained.
    \item If two identical class features are explicitly based on level, the levels of the two classes stack for determining the power of the ability.
    \item If two identical class features say how they stack, those rules trump any other rules.
\end{itemize}
These are some examples of how to use these guidelines.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Both a druid and a ranger gain woodland stride.
        A druid/ranger who has woodland stride from both classes has the same woodland stride ability as a druid or ranger would.
    \item Both a barbarian and a rogue get uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge at the same level.
        A barbarian/rogue adds his barbarian and rogue levels together to determine when he acquires improved uncanny dodge.
\end{itemize}

\parhead{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
A character uses only the highest number of weapon proficiencies granted by her classes.
If a class grants proficiency with specific weapon groups, that is counted as a chosen weapon group for the purpose of the number of weapon proficiencies the character may choose.
For example, a fighter/paladin would have three weapon groups of her choice, plus the weapon group of her favored deity.

However, if a class grants proficiency with a specific weapon, it is not counted against the number of weapon groups the character gains from that class.
For example, a rogue/fighter gains proficiency with four weapon groups of his choice, and is additionally proficient with saps.

\subsection{Spellcasters and Multiclassing}\label{Spellcasters and Multiclassing}
The character gains spells from all of his or her spellcasting classes separately and tracks his spells per day, spells known, and spellpower separately with each class.

Characters with magical ability gain a special benefit when multiclassing.
Such a character must choose a specific spellcasting class he has.
For every two levels that a character has in nonmagical classes, up to the number of levels he has in his chosen spellcasting class, he increases his spellcasting ability with that class.
This increases his spells per day, spells known, and spellpower as if he had gained a level in his chosen spellcasting class.
No class features or other abilities can be gained in this way.


For example, Gish, a 2nd level fighter / 2th level wizard, would have the spells per day, spells known, and spellpower of a 3rd level wizard.
If he gained two more fighter levels, his spellcasting ability would not increase.
