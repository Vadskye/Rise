\end{itemize*}

\subsection{Class Description Format}

\parhead{Alignment} Some classes have alignment restrictions. See Chapter 6: Description for a description of what alignments are.

\parhead{Hit Value} At each level, you gain hit points equal to your class's Hit Value \add half your Constitution.

\parhead{Class Skills} These are skills that members of this class are typically good at.

\parhead{Skill Points} This is the number of skill points that members of this class get.

\parhead{Weapon and Armor Proficiencies} These are the types of equipment that members of this class are trained in using.

\parhead{Base Attack Progression} This measures how skilled a character is in combat. A character adds his base attack bonus to all attacks he makes, and half his base attack bonus to his physical defenses, which represents how hard he is to hit. There are three progressions: Good, Average, or Poor. The effects of each progression are described on \trefnp{Base Progressions}.

A high base attack bonus can grant additional attacks, as described in \pcref{Combat}.

\parhead{Base Special Defense Progressions} This measures how resistant members of the class are to unusual kinds of attacks. There are three kinds of saving throws. Fortitude saves represent your ability to resist attacks on your body, like poisons and diseases. Reflex saves represent your ability to avoid attacks, such as pit traps or explosions. Will saves represent your ability to resist mental influence, like fearsome creatures and enchantment spells. You add your base saving throw bonus to all saving throws you make of that type. There are three progressions: Good, Average, or Poor. The effects of each progression are described on \trefnp{Base Progressions}.

\sssecfake{Class Skills}
The barbarian's class skills (and the key attribute for each skill) are
Athletics (Str), Climb (Str), Swim (Str), Acrobatics (Dex), Ride (Dex), Perception (Wis), Survival (Wis), Creature Handling (Cha), and Intimidate (Cha).
\cf{Bbn}{Skill Points at 1st Level} 4

\sssecfake{Class Features}

All of the following are class features of the barbarian.
\cf{Bbn}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}  A barbarian is proficient with simple weapons, any four other weapon groups, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).

\cf{Bbn}{Damage Reduction (Ex)} A barbarian has the ability to shrug off some amount of injury from attacks. He has physical damage reduction equal to his barbarian level. This damage reduction allows the barbarian to ignore the first points of physical damage he takes each round.

\cf{Bbn}{Rage (Ex)} A barbarian can fly into a rage as a swift action. While in a rage, he gains a \plus2 bonus to Strength and Charisma, and gains 2 temporary hit points per barbarian level. However, he takes a \minus2 penalty to physical defenses. The extra hit points gained from raging are lost before any other hit points (see \pcref{Temporary Hit Points}). While raging, a barbarian cannot take any action that requires patience or concentration, such as casting spells.

A barbarian's ability to maintain his rage depends on his willpower. A fit of rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 5 \add the barbarian's (newly increased) Charisma. He may prematurely end his rage, and it ends automatically if he becomes unconscious. At the end of the rage, the barbarian takes nonlethal damage equal to the number of temporary hit points he gained by raging. If the barbarian has any temporary hit points remaining at the end of his rage, the nonlethal damage is dealt to those hit points before they go away. In addition, he becomes fatigued until he rests for 5 minutes. A fatigued character can neither sprint nor charge and is vulnerable, giving it a \minus2 penalty to attacks, defenses, and checks. The barbarian cannot enter a rage while he is fatigued from his previous rage.

The amount by which the barbarian's attributes increase, and the number of temporary hit points gained per barbarian level, is called the barbarian's rage bonus. A barbarian can fly into a rage a number of times per day equal to his rage bonus. The barbarian's rage bonus improves to \plus3 at 8th level, to \plus4 at 14th level, and finally to \plus5 at 20th level. His penalty to physical defenses while raging remains the same.

\cf{Bbn}{Endurance} A barbarian gains Endurance (see \hyperlink{feat:Endurance}{Endurance}) as a bonus feat at 2nd level. If he already has Endurance, he may gain any other feat for which he qualifies as a bonus feat.

\cf{Bbn}{Fast Movement (Ex)} At 2nd level, a barbarian increases his land speed by 10 feet while unencumbered.

\cf{Bbn}{Uncanny Dodge (Ex)} Starting at 3rd level, a barbarian can react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He may apply his Dexterity and dodge modifier to his physical defenses while flat-footed.

If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he stacks those levels to determine whether he gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.

\cf{Bbn}{Channeled Rage} At 3rd level, a barbarian gains the ability to enter a channeled rage whenever he rages. Each channeled rage grants the barbarian additional abilities while in that rage or changes the nature of his rage.
\par A barbarian can only be in one channeled rage at a time. By spending an additional use of his rage ability, he can change which channeled rage he is in without exiting the rage, but this does not extend the duration of the rage. A barbarian chooses one channeled rage that he may enter at 3rd level, plus one every three levels thereafter. Some channeled rages require a minimum barbarian level to acquire, as indicated before the name of the ability. 
\par Channeled rage abilities are (Ex) abilities unless otherwise noted. All bonuses granted by channeled rages apply only while the barbarian is in that channeled rage.

\subcf{Athletic Rage} The barbarian adds his rage bonus to his Athletics, Climb, and Swim checks. Additionally, he is always treated as having a running start when jumping.

\subcf{Agile Rage} The barbarian's rage increases his Dexterity in place of his Strength.

\subcf{Endless Rage} The barbarian's rage lasts for an additional 5 rounds.

%Needs to be stronger
\subcf{Fearless Rage} The barbarian becomes immune to fear and harmful morale effects. All allies who can see or hear him gain a \plus4 bonus to saving throws against fear and harmful morale effects.

\subcf{Savage Rage} The barbarian gains the unarmed warrior ability (see Unarmed Warrior, \pref{Mnk:Unarmed Warrior}), increasing his power with unarmed attacks (1d6 damage for a Medium barbarian).

\subcf{Wary Rage} The barbarian only suffers a \minus1 penalty to physical defenses for raging.

\subcf{Willful Rage} The barbarian adds his rage bonus to his Will saves.

\subcf{6th -- Terrifying Rage (Su)} Whenever the barbarian attacks, all enemies he threatens must make a Will save or be shaken for 5 rounds. The save DC is equal to 10 \add the barbarian's level \add his Charisma modifier. A shaken creature is vulnerable, causing it to take a \minus2 penalty to attacks, defenses, and checks. This can only affect any individual creature once per 24 hours.

\subcf{6th -- Unstoppable Rage} Each round, the barbarian can bull rush an opponent as a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

\subcf{9th -- Overwhelming Rage (Su)} The barbarian counts as two creatures for the purpose of determining overwhelm penalties. This does not allow him to overwhelm a creature by himself.

\subcf{12th -- Overpowering Rage} The barbarian adds his rage bonus to his maneuver modifier.

\subcf{12th -- Spellbreaker Rage (Su)} The barbarian gains spell resistance while raging. A creature with spell resistance may always make a saving throw when a spell is cast on it. The saving throw type is indicated by the spell. If the barbarian succeeds, the spell has no effect on him.

\subcf{15th -- Mindless Rage} The barbarian becomes immune to mind-affecting spells and effects.

\subcf{18th -- Invulnerable Rage} The barbarian doubles his damage reduction. This replaces his rage bonus to Strength.

\cf{Bbn}{Grit (Ex)} At 4th level, a barbarian's resilience allows him to shrug off magical effects. If he makes a successful Fortitude save against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage.

\cf{Bbn}{Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)} At 6th level and higher, a barbarian is always treated as being threatened by two fewer creatures than he actually is for the purpose of determining overwhelm penalties. This defense can deny a barbarian the ability to sneak attack the barbarian.
\par If a character already has improved uncanny dodge from a second class and gains improved uncanny dodge, the character stacks those levels to determine if he should gain greater uncanny dodge.

\cf{Bbn}{Larger than Life (Ex)} A barbarian of 7th level or higher holds the strength of a giant in the body of a man (or woman). The barbarian is treated as being one size category larger than he actually is for the purpose of maneuvers he performs or is the target of, checks that are affected by size (such as Strength checks to break down doors), and whether a creature's special attacks based on size can affect him if doing so is advantageous to him. In addition, though he uses weapons of the same size, his weapons deal damage as if they were one size category larger, including natural weapons and unarmed strikes. The barbarian's space and reach remain those of a creature of his actual size. The benefits of this class feature stack with the effects of spells and abilities that increase the barbarian's size category.

\cf{Bbn}{Greater Uncanny Dodge (Ex)} At 10th level and higher, a barbarian no longer suffers overwhelm penalties, regardless of the number of foes surrounding him.

\cf{Bbn}{Tireless Rage (Ex)} At 11th level and higher, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his rage.

\cf{Bbn}{Chaotic Rage (Ex)} At 12th level, the barbarian gains the ability to change channeled rage abilities at will, without consuming an additional use of his rage ability. He may not change channeled rages in this way more than once per round.

\cf{Bbn}{Indomitable Will (Ex)} At 13th level, a barbarian becomes immune to compulsion and domination spells and effects.

\cf{Bbn}{Improved Grit (Ex)} At 16th level, a barbarian's fortitude knows no bounds. If he fails a Fortitude save against an effect that deals half damage on a successful save, he takes only half damage.

\cf{Bbn}{Larger than Belief (Ex)} At 17th level, the barbarian's larger than life ability improves. He is treated as being two size categories larger than he actually is.

\cf{Bbn}{Deathless Rage (Ex)} At 19th level and higher, a raging barbarian can scorn death and unconsciousness. As long as his rage continues, he is not staggered at 0 hit points, and cannot take critical damage. However, every 50 points of damage he takes in excess of his hit points reduces the duration of his rage by one round, and the Endless Rage channeled rage ability does not extend the duration of his rage if he is at 0 hit points. Once his rage ends, the effects of the barbarian's wounds apply normally if they have not been healed. This ability does not prevent death from spell effects such as \spell{finger of death} or \spell{disintegrate}.

\cf{Bbn}{Limitless Rage (Ex)} At 20th level, the barbarian may rage at will. He no longer has any limitation on the number of times he can rage each day. He may still rage no more than once per encounter.

\cd{Alignment} A cleric's alignment must be within one step of his deity's (that is, it may be one step away on either the lawful-chaotic axis or the good-evil axis, but not both). A cleric may not be neutral unless his deity's alignment is also neutral.

\cd{Hit Value} 5.

\sssecfake{Class Skills}
The cleric's class skills (and the key attribute for each skill) are Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Knowledge (the planes) (Int), Heal (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Wis), Persuasion (Cha), and Intimidate (Cha).

\cf{Clr}{Skill Points at 1st Level} 2.

 \sssecfake{Class Features}
All of the following are class features of the cleric.

 \cf{Clr}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}  Clerics are proficient with simple weapons, any two other weapon groups, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).

\cf{Clr}{Bonus Languages} A cleric's bonus language options include Celestial, Abyssal, and Infernal (the languages of good, chaotic evil, and lawful evil outsiders, respectively). These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of his race.

\cf{Clr}{Domains} A cleric chooses two domains, which represent his personal spiritual inclinations. If he has a deity, he must choose his domains from among those his deity offers. A cleric's choice of domains has broad effects on the cleric's spellcasting and supernatural abilities. Each domain has an associated domain attribute which is used for the domain's abilities. The domains and their attributes are listed below. If a domain offers a choice of multiple attributes, the cleric must choose which attribute to use when he gains the domain, and that choice cannot normally be changed.

\subcf{Air} Dexterity or Wisdom
\subcf{Chaos} Charisma
\subcf{Death} Constitution
\subcf{Destruction} Strength or Charisma
\subcf{Earth} Constitution or Wisdom
\subcf{Evil} Charisma
\subcf{Fire} Dexterity or Wisdom
\subcf{Good} Wisdom or Charisma
\subcf{Knowledge} Intelligence
\subcf{Law} Wisdom
\subcf{Magic} Intelligence
\subcf{Protection} Constitution or Wisdom
\subcf{Strength} Strength
\subcf{Travel} Any physical attribute
\subcf{Trickery} Dexterity or Charisma
\subcf{Vitality} Constitution
\subcf{War} Any 
\subcf{Water} Dexterity or Wisdom

\cf{Clr}{Spells} A cleric casts divine spells using his Charisma. To learn or cast a spell, a cleric must have a Charisma at least equal to half the spell's level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a cleric's spell is 10 \add half the cleric's caster level \add his Charisma.

Like other spellcasters, the number of spells a cleric knows and can cast each day is limited. These limitations are given below on \trefnp{Cleric Spells per Day} and \trefnp{Cleric Spells Known}. A cleric's spells are drawn from the divine spell list (\pcref{Divine Spells}), as well as from his domains (\pcref{Cleric Domains}). Two spells at every spell level must be drawn from the cleric's domains; sometimes these spells are normal spells on the cleric's spell list, but often they are only accessible by the domain. A cleric may also choose spells from his domain lists with his normal spells known.

Clerics meditate or pray for their spells. Each cleric must choose a time at which he must spend 1 hour each day performing a ritual, worshipping, or quietly contemplating to regain his daily allotment of spells. They do not need to rest to regain spells.

A cleric can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to his own or his deity's (if he has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.

\cf{Clr}{Rituals} Clerics, like other spellcasters, can perform rituals to create unique magical effects (see \pcref{Rituals}). A cleric begins play with a ritual book containing one divine ritual of his choice (see \pcref{Divine Rituals}).

\cf{Clr}{Lesser Domain Aspect (Su)} A cleric's abilities are shaped by his domains. Each domain grants a lesser domain aspect. Lesser domain aspects are not activated. Options for domain aspects are listed at \pcref{Lesser Domain Aspects}. A cleric gains an additional lesser domain aspect at 2nd level.

\cf{Clr}{Matters of Faith (Ex)} A cleric gains a \plus10 bonus to Knowledge (religion) checks made concerning his faith, such as questions about his deity or philosophy, religious rites, holy sites, and so on. Further, he is treated as being trained in Knowledge (religion) when making such checks, whether or not he actually is.

\cf{Clr}{Channel Energy (Su)} At 2nd level, by channeling the power of his faith through his holy (or unholy) symbol, a cleric can act as a powerful conduit of divine energy. He must choose whether to channel positive or negative energy. Once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed.

When a cleric channels energy, it affects all creatures in a \areamed radius burst centered on him, including himself. The cleric may choose to exclude a number of creatures from the effect equal to 1 \add half his Wisdom. The amount of damage dealt (if negative energy is channeled) or healed (if positive energy is channeled) is equal to 1d6 damage per two cleric levels. Each affected creature can make a Fortitude save to halve the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 \add the cleric's level \add the cleric's Charisma.

Channeling energy is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A cleric can channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 \add half his Charisma. A cleric must be able to present his holy symbol to use this ability. The abilities used 

\cf{Clr}{Channeled Domain Power (Su)} At 5th level, a cleric gains a channeled domain power from one of his domains. Unless otherwise stated, using a channelled domain power is identical to using channel energy and consumes a use of the cleric's channel energy ability. Instead of channeling positive or negative energy, the cleric instead gains the effect of the channelled domain power. If a channeled domain power deals damage, it functions like channeling negative energy unless otherwise noted. If a channeled domain power heals damage, it functions like channeling postive energy unless otherwise noted. The save DC of a cleric's channeled domain power is equal to 10 \add cleric level \add domain attribute. The channeled domain powers are described at \pcref{Channeled Domain Powers}. The cleric gains an additional channeled domain power at 7th level.

\cf{Clr}{Domain Aspect (Su)} At 9th level, a cleric gains a domain aspect from one of his domains. Domain aspects do not require an action to activate. Options for domain aspects are listed at \pcref{Domain Aspects}.  The cleric gains an additional domain aspect from one of his domains at 11th level.

\cf{Clr}{Greater Channeled Domain Power (Su)} At 13th level, a cleric gains a greater channeled domain power from one of his domains. Using a greater channeled domain power consumes two uses of the cleric's channel energy ability. Instead of channeling positive or negative energy, the cleric instead gains the effect of the greater channeled domain power. Options for greater channeled domain powers are listed at \pcref{Greater Channeled Domain Powers}.  The cleric gains an additional greater channeled domain power at 15th level.

\cf{Clr}{Domain Mastery (Su)} At 17th level, a cleric gains a domain mastery from one of his domains. Options for domain masteries are listed at \pcref{Domain Masteries}.  The cleric gains an additional domain mastery at 19th level.

\subcf{Vitality -- }
\subcf{War -- Warmaster's Power} The cleric continuously gains the benefits of the \spell{divine power} spell, with a caster level equal to his cleric level \add his domain attribute. If the effect is dispelled or suppressed, he can resume it as a swift action.
\subcf{Water -- Water's Flow} As a swift action, the cleric can transform himself into a rushing flow of water with a volume roughly equal to his normal volume for 1 round. In this form, he may move wherever water could go, but he cannot take other actions, such as jumping, attacking, or casting spells. His speed is halved when moving uphill and doubled when moving downhill. He does not provoke attacks of opportunity for moving, and has physical damage reduction equal to his cleric level. He may return to his normal form as a free action.
\par If the water is split, he may reform from anywhere the water has reached, to as little as a single ounce of water. If not even an ounce of water exists contiguously, his body reforms from the largest available parts of water, cut into pieces of appropriate size. This usually causes the cleric to die.
\subcf{Wild -- Natural Power} Whenever the cleric is in natural terrain, he gains a \plus2 bonus to caster level and the improved natural casting ability, as the druid class feature (see Improved Natural Casting, \pref{Drd: Improved Natural Casting}).

\subsubsection{Ex-Clerics}
A cleric who grossly violates the code of conduct required by his god loses all spells and supernatural cleric class features. He cannot thereafter gain levels as a cleric of that god until he atones (see the \spell{atonement} spell description).

 \sssecfake{Class Skills}
The druid's class skills (and the key attribute for each skill) are Athletics (Str), Climb (Str), Swim (Str), Ride (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Heal (Wis), Perception (Wis), Survival (Wis), and Creature Handling (Cha).
\cf{Drd}{Skill Points at 1st Level} 4

\sssecfake{Class Features}
All of the following are class features of the druid.

\cf{Drd}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency} Druids are proficient with simple weapons, any one other weapon group, scimitars, sickles, and slings.
\par Druids are proficient with light and medium armor, but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. (A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the \spell{ironwood} spell so that it functions as though it were steel. See the \spell{ironwood} spell description.) Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only wooden ones.
\par A druid who wears prohibited armor or carries a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.

\cf{Drd}{Bonus Languages} A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of magical woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.

A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids. Druidic has its own alphabet.

\cf{Drd}{Spells} A druid casts nature spells using her Wisdom. To learn or cast a spell, a druid must have a Wisdom at least equal to half the spell's level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 \add half the druid's caster level \add the druid's Wisdom.

Like other spellcasters, the number of spells a druid knows and can cast each day is limited. These limitations are given below on \trefnp{Druid Spells per Day} and \trefnp{Druid Spells Known}. A druid's spells are drawn from the nature spell list (see \pcref{Nature Spells}).

Druids meditate or pray for their spells. Each druid must choose a time at which she must spend 1 hour each day performing a ritual, worshipping, or quietly contemplating to regain her daily allotment of spells. They do not need to rest to regain spells.

\cf{Drd}{Rituals} Druids, like other spellcasters, can perform rituals to create unique magical effects (see \pcref{Rituals}). A druid begins play with a ritual book containing one nature ritual of her choice (see \pcref{Nature Rituals}).

\cf{Drd}{Nature Sense (Ex)} A druid gains a \plus2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks. In addition, she can make those checks as if she were trained.

\cf{Drd}{Wild Speech (Su)} One of the first lessons a druid learns is how to commune with natural creatures. A druid can speak with animals a number of times per day equal to half her druid level \add her Charisma (minimum 1). Each time she uses this ability, she chooses a kind of animal, such as owl or wolf. She can then speak to and understand animals of that type for a number of minutes equal to her druid level.

This ability doesn't make the animals any more friendly or cooperative than normal. Furthermore, wary and cunning animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while the more stupid ones make inane comments. If an animal is friendly toward the druid, she may be able to convince it to do some favor or service.

\cf{Drd}{Woodland Stride (Ex)} Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. However, plants magically manipulated to impede motion still affect her.

 \cf{Drd}{Wild Aspect (Su)} At 3rd level, a druid gains the ability to embody an aspect of an animal. Embodying a wild aspect is a standard action. Wild aspects last for 5 minutes, or until the druid dismisses them (a swift action).
\par The druid can use this ability a number of times per day equal to half her druid level \add her Constitution (minimum 1). She can only have one wild aspect active at once. If she attempts to embody a new wild aspect, her old wild aspect is dismissed. At 8th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, she gains the ability to keep an additional wild aspect active at the same time.
\par The descriptions below describe the effects of the aspect. With many aspects, the druid's appearance also changes to match the aspect, but this is not described. Different druids change in different ways. For example, one druid might gain unusually large eyes when embodying the low-light vision aspect, while another might change her irises into slits, like a cat, when embodying the same aspect. The changes made are up to the druid, but cannot be used to gain an additional substantive benefit beyond the effects given in the description of the aspect.
\par The druid may choose any wild aspect, provided that she has the minimum druid level indicated by the aspect. At 5th level, and every odd level thereafter, she learns a new wild aspect.

\subcf{Animal Affinity} The druid gains a \plus2 enhancement bonus to Creature Handling and Ride checks. This bonus increases by \plus1 at 8th, 14th, and 20th druid level.
\subcf{Bear's Endurance} The druid gains a \plus2 enhancement bonus to Constitution.
\subcf{Bite} The druid's mouth transforms, allowing it to perform a bite attack.The attack deals 1d8 damage for a Medium druid. (See \pcref{Natural Weapons}, for details about natural weapons.)
\subcf{Bull's Strength} The druid gains a \plus2 enhancement bonus to Strength.
\subcf{Cat's Grace} The druid gains a \plus2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity.
\subcf{Claws} The druid's hands transform, allowing them to perform claw attacks. Each claw deals 1d6 damage for a Medium druid. (see \pcref{Natural Weapons}, for details about natural weapons).
\subcf{Constrict} The druid's body transforms, allowing it to perform a constrict attack. The attack deals 1d10 damage for a Medium druid, but it can only be used against a foe you are grappling with. (See \pcref{Natural Weapons}, for details about natural weapons). 
\subcf{Eagle's Splendor} The druid gains a \plus2 enhancement bonus to Charisma.
\subcf{Fox's Cunning} The druid gains a \plus2 enhancement bonus to Intelligence.
\subcf{Gore} The druid's head transforms, allowing it to perform a gore attack. The attack deals 1d8 damage for a Medium druid. (See \pcref{Natural Weapons}, for details about natural weapons.)
\subcf{Lope} The druid gains the ability to move on all four limbs. When doing so, she increases her speed by 20 feet, but she cannot use her hands for anything except moving. When not moving on four legs, her ability to use her hands is unchanged.
\subcf{Low-light Vision} The druid gains low-light vision. She can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. She retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
\subcf{Owl's Wisdom} The druid gains a \plus2 enhancement bonus to Wisdom.
\subcf{Shrink} The druid shrinks by a size category, halving her height, length, and width, and dividing her weight by 8. This gives her a \minus10 foot penalty to her speed, a \plus1 bonus to physical attacks and defenses, and a \minus4 penalty to maneuvers and Maneuver Class. This is a size-affecting effect.
\subcf{Talons} The druid's feet transform, allowing them to perform a talon attack.
\subcf{5th -- Scent} The druid gains the scent ability, granting her a \plus10 bonus to scent-based Perception checks (see \pcref{Perception}).
\subcf{5th -- Glide} The druid grows wings, granting her a glide speed equal to her land speed. See \pcref{Gliding}, for more details.
\subcf{5th -- Grow} The druid grows by a size category, doubling her height, length, and width, and multiplying her weight by 8. This gives her a \plus10 foot bonus to her speed, a \minus1 penalty to physical attacks and defenses, and a \plus4 bonus to maneuvers and Maneuver Class. This is a size-affecting effect.
\subcf{7th -- Natural Grab} If the druid hits with a natural attack, she may attempt to grapple her foe as an immediate action. She cannot provoke an attack of opportunity for the grapple attempt.
\subcf{7th -- Natural Knockback} If the druid hits with a natural attack, she may attempt to bull rush her foe as an immediate action. She cannot provoke an attack of opportunity for the bull rush attempt. She cannot move with the struck creature to push it back farther. 
\subcf{7th -- Natural Trip} If the druid hits with a natural attack, she may attempt to trip her foe as an immediate action. She cannot provoke an attack of opportunity for the trip attempt.
\subcf{7th -- Slither} The druid gains a climb speed equal to half her base land speed. She does not need to use her hands to climb in this way. See \pcref{Climbing}, for more details.
\subcf{9th -- Climb} The druid gains a climb speed equal to her base land speed. See \pcref{Climbing}, for more details.
\subcf{9th -- Limited Flight} The druid grows wings, granting her a fly speed equal to her land speed with average maneuverability. See \pcref{Flying}, for more details. She can only fly for a number of rounds equal to 3 \add half her Constitution. After that limit is reached, she must rest for 5 minutes.
\subcf{9th -- Venom} When the druid embodies this apsect, she transforms one of her natural weapons to become poisonous. If she hits with that natural attack, she may inject poison as an immediate action. Every round, the creature must make a Fortitude save against a DC equal to 10 \add the druid's level \add her Constitution. If the creature fails, it takes 2 points of Constitution damage. The poison ends after the creature makes two successful Fortitude saves against it.
\subcf{9th -- Wolfpack} Overwhelmed foes the druid threatens increase their overwhelm penalties by 1.

\cf{Drd}{Venom Immunity (Ex)} At 4th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.

\cf{Drd}{Natural Casting (Ex)} At 5th level, whenever the druid casts a druidic area spell that would emanate from her, such as a cone or line spell, she may cause the spell to originate from any position within 10 feet of her. All other aspects of the spell are unchanged.

For example, a druid casting \spell{gust of wind} could create a line of wind originating from 10 feet to her right. The line would extend 50 feet out from that point, as normal. If the druid cause the line of wind to blow to the left, she could potentially be affected by the wind.

\cd{Drd}{Wild Speech (Plants) (Ex)} At 6th level, a druid can also converse with plants and plant creatures using her wild speech ability. A regular plant's sense of its surroundings is limited, so it won't be able to give (or recognize) detailed descriptions of creatures or answer questions about events outside its immediate vicinity.

\cf{Drd}{Improved Wild Speech (Su)} At 8th level, anything the druid speaks with with using her wild speech ability must make a Will save to avoid being charmed, as the \spell{charm person} spell, by the druid. The effect lasts for the duration of the conversation, and for 1 hour thereafter. This ability is not mind-affecting, and can affect creatures or even objects of any kind that the druid can converse with. Objects are always considered to fail their Will save.  The druid can choose not to exert this influence.

\cf{Drd}{Improved Natural Casting (Ex)} At 10th level, a druid expands the range of her natural casting ability. She can cause area spells to originate from up to \rngclose range away from her.

\cf{Drd}{Natural Aspect (Su)} At 11th level, a druid gains the ability to assume aspects of the natural world, including the elements, in addition to those of animals. She adds the options below to the list of abilities she can gain with her wild aspect ability.

%\subcf{Aerial Combat} The druid gains a \plus2 bonus to physical attacks while either she or her target is airborne.
%\subcf{Aquatic Combat} The druid gains a \plus2 bonus to physical attacks while both she and her target are touching naturally occuring water (including rain, but not fog or ice). 
%\subcf{Earthen Combat} The druid gains a \plus2 bonus to physical attacks with melee attacks while both she and her target are touching natural earth or stone.
%\subcf{Fiery Combat} The druid gains a \plus2 bonus to physical attacks while she or her target is ignited.
%\subcf{Earthen Power} The druid gains a \plus2 bonus to caster level while she is touching natural earth or stone.
\subcf{Heart of Air} The druid can breathe in any environment, and is immune to \spell{sickening cloud} and similar effects. In addition, she falls at half speed and takes no falling damage.
\subcf{Heart of Earth} The druid gains the effects of the \spell{stoneskin} spell, with a caster level equal to her druid level \add her Constitution.
\subcf{Heart of Fire} The druid gains the effects of the warm version of the \spell{fire shield} spell, with a caster level equal to her druid level \add her Constitution.
\subcf{Heart of the Sun} The druid constantly radiates bright light out to a 100 foot radius (and shadowy illumination for an additional 100 feet). The illumination is so bright that she becomes hard to look at. Any creature attacking her from within the radius of bright light becomes dazzled for 5 rounds after the attack.
\subcf{Heart of Oak} The druid gains the effects of the \spell{stoneskin} spell, with a caster level equal to her druid level \add her Constitution, except that the damage reduction is overcome by fire instead of adamantine weapons.
\subcf{Heart of Water} The druid gains the effects of the \spell{freedom} spell.
\subcf{15th -- Air Mantle}  The druid is surrounded by a mantle of air. Thrown and projectile weapons have a 50\% chance to miss her while this effect is active. Unusually large weapons, such as a giant's boulders, may suffer a decreased miss chance as appropriate to their size.
\subcf{15th -- Aqueous Step}  Wherever the druid moves, she leaves a path of animated water that can grab creatures and cause them to trip. A creature crossing the path must make a Reflex save with a DC equal to 10 \add the druid's level \add the druid's Constitution or fall prone and be unable to complete the movement.
\subcf{15th -- Flaming Step} Wherever the druid moves, she leaves a path of burning flame behind her that lasts for 1 round. A creature who crosses the path takes 1d6 points of fire damage per two druid levels. It can make a Reflex save to halve the damage, with a DC equal to 10 \add the druid's level \add the druid's Constitution.
\subcf{15th -- Lifegiving Step} Wherever the druid moves, she leaves a path of small, living plants that entangle foes for 1 round. An enemy crossing the path must make a Reflex save with a DC equal to 10 \add the druid's level \add the druid's Constitution or be entangled by the plants and unable to complete the movement. The plants appear on any surface, and will continue to grow if they can survive, though they may die quickly if they appear on inhospitable terrain.
\subcf{17th -- Flight} The druid gains a fly speed equal to her land speed, with good maneuverability. She may remain flying for up to 5 rounds at a time. After that, she must land for 1 round before she can fly again. See \pcref{Flying}, for more details.
\subcf{17th -- Flaming Soul} The druid gains the fire subtype, making her immune to fire but giving her a 50\% vulnerability to cold damage. In addition, whenever she deals fire damage to a creature, the creature is ignited for 5 rounds.
\par An ignited creature is vulnerable, causing it to take a \minus2 penalty to attacks, defenses, and checks. In addition, it takes d6 damage per round from the fire. If the creature takes a move action, it can attempt a DC 15 Reflex save to put out the flames. This action provokes attacks of opportunity. Dropping prone as part of the action gives a \plus4 bonus on this save.
\subcf{17th -- Sunblessed Rejuvenation} The druid gains fast healing equal to her druid level as long as she remains in sunlight or touches a plant of her size or larger.
\subcf{17th -- Sunscour} This aspect functions like the heart of the sun natural aspect, except that it also suppresses shadow effects and the visual components of illusions within the area of bright light. 
\subcf{17th -- Water's Flow} As a swift action, the druid can transform herself into a rushing flow of water with a volume roughly equal to her normal volume for 1 round. In this form, she may move wherever water could go, but she cannot take other actions, such as jumping, attacking, or casting spells. Her speed is halved when moving uphill and doubled when moving downhill. She does not provoke attacks of opportunity for moving, and has physical damage reduction equal to her druid level. She may return to her normal form as a free action.
\par If the water is split, she may reform from anywhere the water has reached, to as little as a single ounce of water. If not even an ounce of water exists contiguously, her body reforms from the largest available parts of water, cut into pieces of appropriate size. This usually causes the druid to die.

\cf{Drd}{A Thousand Faces (Su)} At 12th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the \spell{disguise self} spell. This affects the druid's body but not her possessions. It is not an illusory effect, but a minor physical alteration of the druid's appearance, within the limits described for the spell.

\cf{Drd}{Elemental Speech (Su)} At 14th level, the druid gains the ability to speak with one of the elements that make up the natural world with her wild speech ability. When she gains this ability, she chooses whether she can speak with natural air, earth, fire, or water.

\cf{Drd}{Timeless Body (Ex)} After attaining 14th level, a druid no longer takes attribute penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.

\cf{Drd}{Commanding Wild Speech (Ex)} At 16th level, the druid can use her wild speech ability to control creatures' actions. If the druid converses with a creature using her wild speech ability, she may spend a standard action and an additional wild speech use to dominate one creature she is speaking with, as the \spell{dominate person} spell. A successful Will save against a DC of 10 \add druid level \add Charisma negates this effect. This ability is not mind-affecting, and can affect creatures of any kind that the druid can converse with.

\cf{Drd}{Totemic Aspect (Su)} At 18th level, the druid can choose any one wild aspect (but not natural aspect). She permanently gains the abilities of that aspect, as if she was constantly manifesting it. She may suppress or resume this effect as a swift action.

\cf{Drd}{Greater Natural Casting (Ex)} At 20th level, a druid may cause area spells to originate from any point within \rngmed range of her, as the natural casting ability.

\subsubsection{Ex-Druids}
A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and supernatural druid class features. She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the \spell{atonement} ritual).

\cd{Alignment} Any.

\cd{Hit Value} 6.

\sssecfake{Class Skills}
The fighter's class skills (and the key attribute for each skill) are Athletics (Str), Climb (Str), Swim (Str), Ride (Dex), and Intimidate (Cha).
\cf{Ftr}{Skill Points at 1st Level} 2.

\sssecfake{Class Features}
All of the following are class features of the fighter.
 \cf{Ftr}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}  A fighter is proficient with simple weapons,  any four other weapon groups,  all armor (heavy, medium, and light) and shields (including tower shields).

\cf{Ftr}{Armor Discipline} At 1st level, a fighter's training grants him additional capability when using his armor. He may choose an armor category (light, medium, heavy, or shields), or he may choose to train equally with all kinds of armor and shields. Whether or not he chooses a specific armor category, he reduces his armor check penalty by 2 and reduces his arcane spell failure by 5\% when using his chosen armor. These benefits apply separately to armor and shields, if the fighter uses both and chose not to focus in a particular armor category. This effect cannot reduce those penalties below 0.
\par If the fighter chose a particular armor category, he gains a \plus1 bonus to his dodge defense modifier while using armor of that category.

\cf{Ftr}{Bonus Feat} At 2nd level, a fighter gets a bonus combat-oriented feat. This bonus feat must be drawn from the feats noted as combat feats on \tref{Combat Feats}. A fighter must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including attribute score and base attack bonus minimums. The fighter gains an additional bonus feat at 6th level and every four fighter levels thereafter (6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th).

\cf{Ftr}{Weapon Discipline} At 3rd level, a fighter's training grants him additional capability when using his weapons. He may choose a weapon group, or he may choose to train equally with all weapons. If he chooses a weapon group, he gains a \plus1 bonus to physical attacks with weapons from that group.
\par If he chooses not to focus on a specific group of weapons, he gains the ability to become proficient with any weapon group if he spends 8 hours training with a weapon from that group. He may only keep this proficiency with one weapon group at a time; if he trains with a new weapon group, he loses his proficiency in the previous group.

\cf{Ftr}{Adaptive Style Feats} At 4th level, a fighter gains a flexible bonus feat which he can change each day. The fighter chooses a number of combat feats equal to half his fighter level \add his Intelligence. These feats comprise his adaptive style feat pool. He gains any one feat from the pool as a bonus feat (for which he must still meet the normal prerequisites). At the start of each day, the fighter may train for an hour. If he does so, he may choose to change his current adaptive style feat to one of the other feats in his adaptive style feat pool, assuming he meets the prerequisites for the feat.  The fighter gains an additional adaptive style feat at 8th level and every four fighter levels thereafter (8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th).

\par An adaptive style feat may be used normally as prerequisites for other feats or abilities.  However, if an adaptive style feat is used as a prerequisite, it cannot be changed until the fighter no longer needs to use it as a prerequisite, such as might happen if the fighter takes the feat as a normal feat or bonus feat.

\par In order to gain an adaptive style feat, it must be reasonably possible to do training related to the new feat. For example, a fighter could not gain Weapon Focus in axes without at least one axe available to train with.

\cf{Ftr}{Combat Discipline} At 5th level, a fighter can use his superior training and focus to keep fighting in the face of debilitating effects. When a fighter is initially affected by one of the conditions listed on \trefnp{Combat Discipline Conditions}, he may use his combat discipline ability to instead suffer the mitigated condition one column to the right. This lasts until the end of the original condition or for one round per two fighter levels, at which point he suffers the effects of the original condition unless he uses his combat discipline ability again.
\par Using combat discipline takes no action, and can be done at any time, even when it isn't the fighter's turn. A fighter may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 \add his Constitution.

\begin{dtable}

1. Allows the fighter to mitigate up to half his fighter level in ability damage or penalties per use of combat discipline. \\
2. Mitigates the penalties, but does not prevent the fighter from taking d6 fire damage per round until the fire is put out. \\
3. Allows the fighter to ignore a single negative level per use of combat discipline.
\end{dtable}

\par A fighter cannot use this ability more than once against a single source. For example, if a fighter is exhausted by a \spell{ray of exhaustion} spell, he can use this ability to downgrade the exhaustion to fatigue, but he can't then expend a second use to negate the fatigue. The lesser condition that this ability imposes may be cured or removed normally, but doing so does not affect the resurgence of the condition the fighter was originally afflicted with. If a fighter uses this ability to mitigate or negate a condition which he must suffer as a sacrifice or cost to gain some benefit, he automatically forfeits the benefit he would have gained.

\cf{Ftr}{Improved Armor Discipline} At 7th level, a fighter's training in his chosen armor category (or with all armor categories) improves. He reduces the armor check penalty by 4 and decreases the arcane spell failure by 15\%. In addition, he treats his chosen armor (or armors) as if it were one encumbrance category lighter than it is. This does not stack with the effects of armor discipline.
\par This ability means heavy armor is treated as medium, medium armor is treated as light armor, and light armor is treated as being unarmored. Likewise, tower shields are treated as heavy shields (and no longer impose a \minus2 penalty to physical attacks), heavy shields are treated as light shields, and both light shields and bucklers are treated as being unarmored. This can remove the halving of the fighter's Dexterity bonus, if appropriate for the new encumbrance of the fighter's armor.
\par This allows the fighter to qualify for class features using the reduced armor encumbrance category. For example, a fighter 9 / wizard 2 who reduces his encumbrance in light armor could cast without any arcane spell failure in light armor.
\par A fighter who chose a specific armor category gains a \plus2 bonus to his dodge defense modifier while using armor of that category.

\cf{Ftr}{Improved Weapon Discipline} At 9th level, a fighter's training in his chosen weapons improves. He gains a \plus4 bonus to resist disarm and sunder attempts when using his chosen weapons. If he chose a specific weapon group, he gains a \plus2 bonus to physical attacks with weapons from that group. If he did not, he can apply all weapon group-specific feats he has to any weapon group that he trains with for 8 hours. He retains this benefit for one week after the training.

\cf{Ftr}{Battlemaster} At 10th level, a fighter can improve his allies' combat abilities. As a standard action, he may grant the use of one of his combat feats to allies within \rngclose range of him who can see and hear him. He can affect a number of allies equal to 1 \add his Intelligence (minimum 1). Affected allies must meet all prerequisites for the granted feat, except that they can ignore any feat prerequisites. The effect lasts for 5 rounds. The fighter can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 \add his Charisma.

\cf{Ftr}{Improved Combat Discipline} At 11th level, a fighter's ability to keep fighting despite negative influence improves. He can reduce conditions by two steps instead of one when using combat discipline. For example, a stunned fighter who used combat discipline would instead be staggered.
\par In addition, a fighter may use combat discipline to reduce any penalties he suffers to attribute scores, physical attacks, weapon damage rolls, skill checks, or ability checks that come from negative effects not listed on the combat discipline chart by 2. This cannot be used to reduce the effects of ability damage or drain.

\cf{Ftr}{Greater Armor Discipline} At 13th level, a fighter's training in his chosen armor becomes still greater. He reduces his armor check penalty by 6 and decreases his arcane spell failure by 30\% when using his chosen armor. In addition, he treats his chosen armor as if it were two encumbrance categories lighter than it actually is whenever doing so would be beneficial to him. This does not stack with the benefits of armor discipline or improved armor discipline.
\par A fighter who chose a specific armor category gains a \plus3 bonus to his dodge defense modifier while using armor of that category.

\cf{Ftr}{Improved Adaptive Style} At 14th level, a fighter's ability to adapt to situations improves. He need only spend 1 minute training to change a single adaptive style feat. He may continue training as he wishes, changing one adaptive style feat per minute.

\cf{Ftr}{Greater Weapon Discipline} At 15th level, a fighter's training in his chosen weapons becomes still greater. He increases the critical threat range and critical multiplier of his chosen weapons by 1. This increase applies after and stacks with any other effects that affect critical threat range or critical multiplier. Thus, a fighter using the Heartseeker combat style and wielding a longsword would have a critical threat range of 16-20 (x3), while a similar fighter would have a critical threat range of 18-20 (x5) with a heavy pick.

\cf{Ftr}{Greater Combat Discipline} At 17th level, a fighter's ability to keep fighting despite influence becomes still greater. When using combat discipline, he may ignore any condition listed on the combat discipline chart. In addition, he may use combat discipline to be dazed rather than suffer any non-damaging condition not listed on the chart.

\cf{Ftr}{Improved Battlemaster} At 18th level, the fighter can improve his allies' combat abilities more effectively. When using his battlemaster ability, he can grant two feats at once. In addition, he can use his battlemaster ability as a swift action.

\cf{Ftr}{True Discipline} At 19th level, a fighter's discipline in his chosen area is beyond equal. He must choose either weapon discipline, armor discipline, or combat discipline. Depending on which discipline he chooses, he gains a different bonus.
\subcf{True Weapon Discipline} The fighter can take 10 on the first attack he makes each round and automatically confirms all critical threats while using his chosen weapons.
\subcf{True Armor Discipline} The fighter no longer suffers armor check penalties or arcane spell failure with his chosen armor. In addition, he treats his chosen armor as if it were three encumbrance categories lighter than it actually is.
\par A fighter who chose a specific armor category gains a \plus4 bonus to his dodge defense modifier while using armor of that category.
\subcf{True Combat Discipline} The fighter can use combat discipline to be staggered instead of suffering any nondamaging negative effect with a duration.

\cf{Ftr}{Greater Adaptive Style} At 20th level, a fighter's ability to react to situations is unparalleled. He need only spend a swift action to exchange an adaptive style feat.

\sssecfake{Class Skills}
The monk's class skills (and the key attribute for each skill) are Athletics (Str), Climb (Str), Swim (Str), Acrobatics (Dex), Escape Artist (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Heal (Wis), Perception (Wis), Survival (Wis), and Perform (Cha).
\cf{Mnk}{Skill Points at 1st Level} 4

\sssecfake{Class Features}
All of the following are class features of the monk.
\cf{Mnk}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
Monks are proficient with simple weapons, monk weapons, and any one other weapon group. Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields. When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses the benefit of her unfettered defense, fast movement, and \ki abilities.

\cf{Mnk}{Unfettered Defense (Ex)} A monk knows how to react intuitively to avoid blows. When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk may add her Wisdom to her physical defenses.

\par This bonus applies even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. She loses this bonus when she is helpless, when she wears any armor, when she carries a shield, or when she carries a medium or heavy load.

\begin{comment}  %Made AC too high
 \cfnl{\Ki Ward (Ex)}\label{Mnk:Ki Ward (Ex)} When unarmored and unencumbered, a monk gains a \plus1 armor bonus to AC at 2nd level. This bonus increases by 1 for every two monk levels thereafter (\plus2 at 4th, \plus3 at 6th, etc.).

\par The monk loses this bonus when she is
immobilized or helpless, when she wears any armor, when she carries a shield, or when she carries a medium or heavy load.
\end{comment}

\cf{Mnk}{Improved Unarmed Strike} The monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. She is treated as armed even while unarmed, and her unarmed strikes can deal lethal damage if she desires.

\cf{Mnk}{Unarmed Warrior (Ex)} The monk's unarmed attacks are exceptionally deadly. She deals damage with her unarmed strikes as if she were two size categories larger (1d6 for a Medium creature, or 1d4 for a small creature).

A monk's attacks may be with either fist interchangeably or even from elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk may even make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A monk's unarmed strike can be treated as a manufactured weapon, natural weapon, or both for the purpose of spells and effects, whichever is more beneficial for the monk. This allows monks to make unarmed strikes as if they were fighting with two weapons at once (see \pcref{Two-Weapon Fighting}). Monks can also use gauntlets, including enchanted gauntlets. The damage dealt by gauntlets is the same as the damage dealt by the monk's normal unarmed strike.

\cf{Mnk}{Fast Movement (Ex)} At 2nd level, a monk increases her land speed by 10 feet while unencumbered.

\cf{Mnk}{Ki Power (Su)} At 2nd level, the monk gains the ability to use channel her \ki energy to enhance her abilities temporarily. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to half her monk level \add her Wisdom, but no more than once per round. If a \ki power allows a saving throw, the DC is equal to 10 \add the monk's level \add her Wisdom. She may choose one of the abilities listed below.

\subcf{Flurry of Blows} When the monk makes a standard attack, she can make an additional attack at a \minus5 penalty.

\subcf{Stunning Fist} As part of an unarmed attack, the monk can strike a weak point to interfere with her foe's \ki. If the attack deals damage, the creature must make a Fortitude save to avoid being staggered for 1 round. If the foe is bloodied, it is stunned for 1 round instead.

\subcf{Surpass Limits} As a swift action, the monk can surpass the physical limitations of her body. Until the start of her next turn, she adds her Wisdom to checks based on Strength and Dexterity. This does not affect checks based on multiple attributes, such as initiative checks.

\cf{Mnk}{Evasion (Ex)} At 3rd level or higher, if a monk makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.

\cf{Mnk}{Uncanny Dodge (Ex)} Starting at 3rd level, a monk can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She may apply her Dexterity and dodge modifier to her physical defenses while flat-footed.

If a monk already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she stacks those levels to determine whether she gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.

\cf{Mnk}{Ki Strike (Su)} At 4th level, a monk's attacks are empowered with \ki. While unarmored and unencumbered, she treats all weapons she wields, including her unarmed strike, as if they were \plus1 weapons, gaining a \plus1 enhancement bonus to attack and damage. This also grants her a \plus1 enhancement bonus with maneuvers. At 7th level, and every three levels thereafter, the bonus granted by the monk's \ki strike ability improves by 1. 

\cf{Mnk}{Perfect Health} At 4th level, the monk gains the Perfect Health feat as a bonus feat, making her immune to diseases of all kinds. If she already has the feat, she gains another feat of her choice for which she qualifies.

\cfnl{Ki Power (Su)} At 5th level, the monk gains an additional \ki power ability. She may choose any of the abilities below in addition to any \ki power ability she could have chosen earlier.

\subcf{Speed Boost} As a swift action, the monk can force her muscles to strain beyond their normal limits. For 1 round, she gains increases her land speed by 20 feet, and a gains \plus2 bonus to her dodge defense modifier.

\subcf{Wholeness of Body} As a standard action, the monk can correct the flow of energy within her body. She heals 1d6 points of damage per two monk levels.

\cf{Mnk}{Still Mind (Ex)} A monk of 5th level or higher may add half her Wisdom to Will saves in place of half her Intelligence.

\cf{Mnk}{Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)} At 6th level and higher, a monk can no longer be overwhelmed as easily; she can react to multiple opponents as easily as she can react to a single attacker. The monk is always treated as being threatened by two fewer creatures than she actually is for the purpose of determining overwhelm penalties.
\par If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class and gains improved uncanny dodge, the character stacks those levels to determine if she should gain greater uncanny dodge.

\cf{Mnk}{Bodily Perfection (Ex)} At 7th level, the monk gains a \plus1 bonus to her Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution.

\cf{Mnk}{Perfect Speech (Ex)} At 8th level, the monk gains the ability to speak with and understand the speech of any living creature. This grants her no special ability to speak to or understand creatures that do not speak, such as animals.

\cfnl{Ki Power (Su)} At 8th level, the monk gains an additional \ki power ability. She may choose any of the abilities below in addition to any \ki power ability she could have chosen earlier.

\subcf{Rapid Step} As a move action, the monk can move up to her speed without provoking attacks of opportunity.

\subcf{Slow Fall} As an immediate action, the monk can slow the rate at which she falls to 60 feet per round, which is too slow to hurt her if she hits the ground. She must be touching a solid object to use this ability. The effect lasts for 1 round.

\cf{Mnk}{Improved Evasion (Ex)} At 9th level, a monk's evasion ability improves. She still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, but henceforth she takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.

\cf{Mnk}{Greater Uncanny Dodge (Ex)} At 10th level and higher, a monk can no longer be overwhelmed, regardless of the number of foes surrounding her.

\cfnl{Ki Power (Su)} At 11th level, the monk gains an additional \ki power ability. She may choose any of the abilities below in addition to any \ki power ability she could have chosen earlier.

\subcf{Diamond Fists} As a swift action, the monk can empower her unarmed strike with incredible force. Until the start of her next turn, she treats her unarmed strike as if it were an adamantine weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

\subcf{Flash Step} As a move action, the monk can slip between spaces, allowing her to teleport to anywhere she can see within 30 feet. If her line of effect is blocked, even by an invisible barrier, or if this would somehow place her inside a solid object, the ability fails. 

\cf{Mnk}{Perfect Soul (Ex)} At 12th level, a monk gains spell resistance. A creature with spell resistance may always make a saving throw when a spell is cast on it. The saving throw type is indicated by the spell. If the monk succeeds, the spell has no effect on her.

\cf{Mnk}{Improved Bodily Perfection} At 13th level, the bonus granted by the monk's bodily perfection ability increases to \plus2.

\cfnl{Ki Power (Su)} At 14th level, the monk gains an additional \ki power ability. She may choose any of the abilities below in addition to any \ki power ability she could have chosen earlier.

\subcf{Empty Step} As a swift action, the monk can step into the Ethereal Plane for 1 round, as the \spell{ethereal jaunt} spell.

\subcf{Quivering Palm} As a standard action, the monk can make a single unarmed strike. If the attack deals damage, the struck creature is sickened by the disruption of the \ki within in its body for 5 rounds. At any point during that time, the monk can will the struck target to die (a free action). If she does, and the creature is bloodied, it must make a Fortitude save. If it fails, it loses all its hit points and takes 9 critical damage, rendering it unconscious and dying (see \pcref{Dying}).

\cf{Mnk}{Timeless (Ex)} Upon attaining 15th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to her attribute scores for aging, and cannot be magically aged. She also gains the benefits of being middle-aged if she did not already possess them, granting her a \plus1 bonus to her Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Any aging penalties she has are removed. The monk still dies of old age when her time is up.

\cf{Mnk}{Perfect Mind (Ex)} At 16th level, the monk becomes immune to hostile mind-affecting effects.

\cfnl{Ki Power (Su)} At 17th level, the monk gains an additional \ki power ability. She may choose any of the abilities below in addition to any \ki power ability she could have chosen earlier.

\subcf{Moment of Perfection} As an immediate action, the monk can align herself with the universe to achieve a single moment of perfection. She can add her monk level as an enhancement bonus to any one attack roll, opposed skill or ability check, or saving throw, or to her physical defenses against any one attack, as if calling upon the effect of a \spell{moment of prescience} spell with a caster level equal to her monk level \add her Wisdom. After using this ability, she must wait five minutes before she can use it again.

\subcf{Empty Body} As a move action, the monk can step into the Ethereal Plane for 5 rounds, as the \spell{ethereal jaunt} spell.

\cf{Mnk}{Uncanny Foresight (Su)} At 18th level, the monk gains the ability to react to situations without premeditation or thought. She is never surprised or flat-footed, and always acts in the first round of combat.

\cf{Mnk}{Greater Bodily Perfection} At 19th level, the bonus granted by the monk's bodily perfection ability increases to \plus3.

\cf{Mnk}{True Perfection} At 20th level, a monk becomes inhumanly perfect. If she rolls less than a 5 on any d20 roll, it is treated as a 5. In addition, she is treated as an outsider rather than as a humanoid for the purpose of spells and magical effects whenever doing so is advantageous to her.

\subsubsection{Ex-Monks}
A monk who becomes chaotic cannot gain new levels as a monk, but retains all monk abilities.

\sssecfake{Class Skills}
The paladin's class skills (and the key attribute for each skill) are Ride (Dex), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Heal (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), and Persuasion (Cha).
\cf{Pal}{Skill Points at 1st Level} 2.

\sssecfake{Class Features}
All of the following are class features of the paladin.
 \cf{Pal}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}  Paladins are proficient with
simple weapons,  any two other weapon groups,  all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with  shields (including tower shields). A paladin is also proficient with the favored weapon group of her deity. If she does not follow a deity, she is proficient with any other weapon group of her choice.
\cf{Pal}{Aura of Good (Ex)} The power of a paladin's aura of good (see the \spell{detect good} spell) is equal to her paladin level.

\cf{Pal}{Discernment (Su)} A paladin can discern truths about creatures he sees as a standard action. This functions as the \spell{detect alignment} spell, except that it only detects evil. The paladin may use this ability a number of times per day equal to half the paladin's level \add the paladin's Wisdom (minimum 1).

At 5th level, she may also detect chaotic alignments.

\cf{Pal}{Smite (Su)} As part of an attack action, a paladin may attempt to smite evil with one normal melee attack. She adds her Charisma (if positive) to her attack roll. If she hits, the paladin deals bonus damage equal to her paladin level. A paladin can smite evil a number of times per day equal to half the paladin's class level \add the paladin's Charisma, but may only do so once per round.

If the paladin smites a creature that is not evil, the smite attack deals no damage at all (not even normal weapon damage), but the use of the ability is still spent.

\cf{Pal}{Improved Smite (Su)} At 2nd level, and every three levels thereafter, the paladin can select one improved smiting ability. Each improved smiting ability adds an effect to the paladin's smite ability. Whenever the paladin smites, she chooses one improved smiting ability she has and adds its effect to her smite. The save DC for a paladin's improved smiting abilities is 10 \add the paladin's level \add the paladin's Charisma. She may select one of the following improved smiting effects.
\subcf{Blinding} The paladin's smite manifests as a bright light. A creature struck by the smite must make a Will save to avoid being blinded for one round per four paladin levels (minimum 1). Creatures vulnerable to light (such as vampires) take extra damage equal to twice the paladin's level.
\subcf{Resounding} The paladin's smite knocks his foes off their feet. A creature struck by the smite must make a Reflex save to avoid being pushed back five feet per four paladin levels and being knocked prone.
\subcf{Staggering} The paladin's smite hits with incredible force. A creature struck by the smite must make a Fortitude save to avoid being staggered for one round per four paladin levels (minimum 1).

\cf{Pal}{Lay On Hands (Su)} Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin can heal wounds (her own or those of others) with a touch. Each use heals 1d8 hit points per paladin level as a standard action. The paladin can lay on hands a number of times per day equal to 1 \add half her Charisma (minimum 1). Against undead creatures, this ability instead deals positive energy damage. A touch attack is required to hit unwilling targets, and a successful Will save halves the damage or healing received.

 \cf{Pal}{Aura of Courage (Su)} Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin is immune to fear (magical or otherwise). Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a \plus4 enhancement bonus to special defenses against fear effects. This ability functions while the paladin is conscious, but not if she is unconscious or dead.

\cf{Pal}{Divine Health (Ex)} At 3rd level, a paladin gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.

\cf{Pal}{Divine Grace (Su)} At 4th level, whenever a paladin makes a successful save against an attack that would normally have a partial effect or deal half damage on a successful save, she instead ignores that aspect of the attack.

\cf{Pal}{Spells} Beginning at 4th level, a paladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the paladin spell list.

Paladins do not require somatic components to cast spells, even if the spell would normally require a somatic component. A paladin need only request the favor of her deity to invoke divine magic.

\par To learn or cast a spell, a paladin must have a Charisma score at least equal to half the spell's level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a paladin's spell is 10 \add half the paladin's caster level \add her Charisma.

\par Like other spellcasters, a paladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on \trefnp{The Paladin}.

A paladin learns and casts spells the way a cleric does, though she does not have access to any domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric does. A paladin may learn and cast any spell on the paladin spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level.

A paladin's selection of spells is limited. A paladin begins play knowing no spells, but gains one or more new spells at certain levels, as indicated on \trefnum{Paladin Spells Known}.

\par At 5th level, a paladin can choose to learn one new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the paladin ``loses'' the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A paladin may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level.

\par Through 3rd level, a paladin has no caster level and is not considered a spellcaster. At 4th level and higher, her caster level is equal to half her paladin level, and she is considered a spellcaster.

\cf{Pal}{Rituals} Experienced paladins, like other spellcasters, can perform rituals to create unique magical effects. A paladin may acquire a ritual book and scribe rituals into it. See \pcref{Rituals}.

\cfnl{Pal}{Improved Smiting (Su)} At 5th level, the paladin gains an additional improved smiting ability, and adds the following improved smiting abilities to the list of those that can be selected.
\subcf{Holy} The paladin's smite is filled with exceptional divine energy. The attack ignores all damage reduction of evil creatures. Undead and evil outsiders take extra damage equal to twice the paladin's level.
\subcf{Penetrating} The paladin's smite punches through her enemies' defenses. The attack ignores a number of points of damage reduction equal to the paladin's level, regardless of the type of damage reduction.
\subcf{Seeking} The paladin's smite is uncannily guided to its target. The attack ignores any miss chance, though the weapon must still be able to strike the target.

\cf{Pal}{Aura of Resolve (Su)} At 6th level, the paladin becomes immune to charm effects. Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a \plus4 enhancement bonus to special defenses against charm effects.

\cf{Pal}{Holy Ward (Sp)} At 6th level, the paladin gains the ability to take damage for her allies. If she spends at least 10 points of healing from her lay on hands ability at once, she can bestow a \spell{share pain} effect on the subject in addition to the healing, using her paladin level \add her Charisma as her caster level.

\cf{Pal}{Smite Chaos (Su)} At 7th level, the paladin gains the ability to smite chaotic creatures as well as evil creatures with her smite ability, but she must choose which to smite before making the attack. If the paladin attempts to smite a chaotic creature, and that creature is not chaotic, the smite attack deals no damage at all (not even normal weapon damage), but the use of the ability is still spent.

\cfnl{Improved Smiting (Su)} At 8th level, the paladin gains an additional improved smiting ability, and adds the following improved smiting abilities to the list of those that can be selected.
\subcf{Dazing} The paladin's smite shatters her foe's ability to concentrate. A creature struck by the smite must make a Fortitude save to avoid being dazed for one round.
\subcf{Impeding} The paladin's smite traps her foe in place, unable to escape her wrath. A creature struck by the smite must make a Reflex save to avoid having all its movement speeds reduced to 5 feet for one round.
\subcf{Coercing} The paladin's smite forces her foe to join the cause of righteousness, if only for a moment. A creature struck by the smite must make a Will save or else be affected by a \spell{suggestion}, as the spell, of the paladin's choice. The effect lasts for one round.

\cf{Pal}{Aura of Determination (Su)} At 9th level, the paladin becomes immune to compulsion effects. Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a \plus4 enhancement bonus to special defenses against compulsion effects.

\cf{Pal}{Discernment (Su)} At 10th level, the paladin may can also identify lies in the range of his discernment ability, as the \spell{discern lies} spell.

\cf{Pal}{Pass Judgment (Su)} At 10th level, the paladin gains the ability to freely pass judgment on those she deems unworthy. As a swift action, she may pass judgment on a creature within 100 feet of her once per day. The creature is treated as being evil, chaotic, or both, at the paladin's discretion, in place of their original alignment. This effect lasts for one day per paladin level, or until the paladin changes her mind about the subject (a free action). This does not change the creature's actions or behavior, but the creature is subject to smite evil or smite chaos, would register as evil under the inspection of a \spell{detect evil} spell, and so on.

No saving throw is allowed against this effect, and it cannot be dispelled, but a \spell{remove curse}, \spell{miracle}, or \spell{wish} spell can remove it. The paladin can use this ability an additional time per day at 13th level and every odd level thereafter. A paladin should be careful when using this ability, as persecution of the innocent can lead overzealous paladins to fall.

\cfnl{Improved Smiting (Su)} At 11th level, the paladin gains an additional improved smiting ability, and adds the following improved smiting ability to the list of those that can be selected.
\subcf{Axiomatic} The paladin's smite is filled with exceptionally lawful divine energy. The attack ignores all damage reduction of chaotic creatures. Aberrations and chaotic outsiders take extra damage equal to twice the paladin's level.

\cf{Pal}{Aura of Protection (Su)} At 12th level, the paladin continuously radiates a \spell{magic circle against evil}, as the spell.

\cf{Pal}{Forgiving Smite (Su)} At 13th level, if a paladin smites a creature who is not evil or chaotic, the smite attempt is not wasted.

\cf{Pal}{Glory of the Martyr (Su)} At 14th level, if the paladin dies while fighting evil or protecting her allies, her fallen body erupts in a burst of positive energy, granting all her allies within 100 feet the benefit of a \spell{heal} spell.

\cfnl{Improved Smiting (Su)} At 14th level, the paladin gains an additional improved smiting ability, and adds the following improved smiting ability to the list of those that can be selected.
\subcf{Dispelling} The paladin's smite strips away her foe's magical protections. A creature struck by the smite is subject to a targeted \spell{dispel magic} with a bonus equal to the paladin's level \add Charisma.

\cf{Pal}{Aura of Warding (Su)} At 15th level, the paladin continuously radiates a \spell{lesser globe of invulnerability}, as the spell. The effect travels with the paladin.

\cf{Pal}{Mighty Aura (Su)} At 16th level, the radius of a paladin's aura abilities expands to 20 feet. Any paladin ability with ``aura'' in the name is considered an aura ability.

\cfnl{Improved Smiting (Su)} At 17th level, the paladin gains an additional improved smiting ability, and adds the following improved smiting ability to the list of those that can be selected.
\subcf{Brilliant} The paladin's smite cannot be turned aside by mortal defenses. The smite is made against the enemy's touch defense.

\cf{Pal}{Greater Aura of Warding (Su)} At 18th level, the paladin radiates a \spell{globe of invulnerability}, as the spell, instead of a \spell{lesser globe of invulnerability}. The effect continues to travel with the paladin.

\cf{Pal}{Martyr's Retribution (Su)} At 19th level, if the paladin dies while fighting evil or protecting her allies, she can choose to make the explosion of positive energy from her glory of the martyr ability painful to her foes. If she does, her body is almost completely consumed by holy power, preventing her from being raised with \spell{raise dead} and similar effects that require a body. This has two effects. First, a \spell{sunburst} spell immediately takes effect over the area where the paladin fell. Second, a \spell{storm of vengeance} spell begins to take effect, centered on the same area. The spell lasts for 10 rounds, and the lightning strikes focus on the paladin's enemies. Both of these effects harm only the paladin's foes, and do no damage to her allies. However, her allies' vision is still impeded by the \spell{storm of vengeance}.

\cf{Pal}{Greater Smite (Su)} At 20th level, the paladin can apply two improved smiting abilities to every smite attack she makes.

\subsubsection{Ex-Paladins}
A paladin who ceases to be lawful good, who willfully commits an evil act, or who grossly violates the code of conduct loses all paladin spells and supernatural paladin class features. She may not progress any farther in levels as a paladin. She regains her abilities and advancement potential if she atones for her violations (see the \spell{atonement} ritual), as appropriate.

\cd{Alignment} Any.

\cd{Hit Value} 6.

\sssecfake{Class Skills}
The ranger's class skills (and the key attribute for each skill) are Athletics (Str), Climb (Str), Swim (Str), Acrobatics (Dex), Escape Artist (Dex), Ride (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Heal (Wis), Perception (Wis), Survival (Wis), and Creature Handling (Cha).
\cf{Rgr}{Skill Points at 1st Level} 6.

\sssecfake{Class Features}

All of the following are class features of the ranger.

\cf{Rgr}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}  A ranger is proficient with simple weapons, any two weapon groups, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). He is also proficient with his choice of bows, crossbows, or thrown weapons.

\cf{Rgr}{Quarry (Ex)} A ranger is a deadly hunter. As a swift action, a ranger may designate any foe he sees as his quarry. A ranger gains a \plus2 bonus to physical attacks, Perception checks, and Survival checks against his quarry. However, while a ranger is pursuing a quarry, he takes a \minus2 penalty on the same rolls against any target other than his quarry. A ranger may give up pursuing a quarry as a free action. He may not have more than one quarry at once; if he designates a new quarry, the old target is no longer considered his quarry. If the ranger does not see his quarry for more than a week, it is no longer considered his quarry.

\par The amount by which a ranger's physical attacks and skill checks increase against his quarry is called his quarry bonus. A ranger can designate a quarry a number of times per day equal to his quarry bonus. The ranger's quarry bonus improves to \plus3 at 8th level, to \plus4 at 14th level, and finally to \plus5 at 20th level. His penalties against targets other than his quarry remains the same.

\cf{Rgr}{Track} A ranger gains Track as a bonus feat (see \pcref{Track}).

\cf{Rgr}{Wild Speech (Su)} A ranger has the ability to communicate with animals. This ability functions like the druid ability of the same name (see Wild Speech, \pref{Drd:Wild Speech}). A ranger can use this ability a number of times per day equal to half his ranger level \add his Charisma.

\cf{Rgr}{Danger Sense (Ex)} Starting at 2nd level, a ranger has an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger, giving him a \plus2 bonus to initiative checks. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter.
\par If a character has danger sense from a multiple classes, the character stacks those levels to determine his bonus from danger sense.

\cf{Rgr}{Favored Terrain (Ex)} At 2nd level, a ranger becomes particularly attuned to certain kinds of terrain. He chooses one kind of terrain to select as a favored terrain from the list below. Usually, rangers favor their home terrain, but a ranger may choose any kind of terrain that he has personally experienced at least once. At 6th level, and every four levels thereafter, the ranger gains an additional favored terrain.
\par While in a favored terrain, a ranger gains a \plus2 bonus to Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks. If he desires, he may leave no trace of his passage, causing attempts to track him to take a \minus20 penalty. In addition, his experience with his favored terrain grants the ranger a single ability, regardless of whether he is currently in that terrain or not. The options for favored terrains are listed below.
\subcf{Aquatic} The ranger gains Skill Focus (Swim) as a bonus feat, and halves the penalties he takes for fighting underwater.
\subcf{Cold} The ranger gains cold damage reduction equal to his ranger level. This allows him to ignore the first points of cold damage he would take each round.
\subcf{Desert} The ranger gains fire damage reduction equal to his ranger level. This allows him to ignore the first points of fire damage he would take each round.
\subcf{Forest} The ranger gains Skill Focus (Stealth) as a bonus feat.
\subcf{Mountains} The ranger gains Skill Focus (Climb) as a bonus feat, and takes half damage from falling damage.
\subcf{Plains} The ranger gains Skill Focus (Perception) as a bonus feat.
\subcf{Swamp} The ranger can move at full speed in water-related difficult terrain.
\subcf{Underground} The ranger gains Blind-Fight as a bonus feat.
\subcf{Urban} The ranger gains Skill Focus (Persuasion) as a bonus feat.

\cf{Rgr}{Ranger Lore} At 3rd level, a ranger can choose an additional ability drawn from ancient ranger lore. All ranger lore abilities are extraordinary abilities unless specified otherwise. He may choose from any of the following options. At 6th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, the ranger gains an additional ranger lore ability.

\subcf{Combat Style} The ranger is skilled with the traditional ranger combat styles. He gains the Precise Shot and Two-Weapon Fighting feats if he meets the prerequisites. However, the benefits of this lore apply only when the ranger uses light or no armor.

\subcf{Evasion} If the ranger makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.

\subcf{Fast Movement} The ranger increases his movement speed by 10 feet when unencumbered.

\subcf{Favored Enemy} The ranger increases his quarry bonus by \plus2 against creatures of a particular kind. The possible creature options are listed on \trefnp{Favored Enemy Options}. The ranger may select this lore multiple times, choosing a different favored enemy each time.

\begin{dtable}
    \lcaption{Favored Enemy Options}
\begin{tabularx}{\columnwidth}{X X}
Animals and vermin & Humanoids (uncivilized) \\
Dragons & Oozes and plants \\
Fey & Outsiders (inner planes) \\
Giants and monstrous humanoids & Outsiders (outer planes) \\
Humanoids (civilized)  & Undead and constructs \\
\end{tabularx}
\end{dtable}

\subcf{Master of the Hunt} The ranger may use a standard action to share the benefits of his quarry ability with all allies who can see and hear him for 5 rounds. The bonus his allies get is considered an enhancement bonus, and they do not suffer penalties against targets other than the quarry.

\subcf{Improved Combat Style} The ranger increases his skill in the traditional ranger combat styles. He adds half his Wisdom to damage when using ranged attacks or when attacking with two weapons at once. Natural weapons qualify for this purpose if the ranger attacks with two natural weapons at once.

The ranger must have the combat style lore to select this lore. The benefits of this lore apply only when the ranger uses light or no armor.

\subcf{Scent} The ranger gains scent. 

\cf{Rgr}{Low-light Vision (Ex)} At 4th level, a ranger's sight improves, allowing him to see in conditions of dim light more easily. He gains low-light vision, as the elf racial ability. If he already has low-light vision, he doubles its benefit, allowing him to see four times as far as a human in poor illumination.

\cf{Rgr}{Tracking Expert (Ex)} At 4th level, a ranger's ability to track his foes improves. He may always take 10 on Survival checks made to track, even if conditions would otherwise prevent this. Additionally, he can move at his normal speed while following tracks without taking the normal \minus5 penalty. He takes only a \minus10 penalty (instead of the normal \minus20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.

\cf{Rgr}{Free Stride (Ex)} At 5th level, a ranger can move through any sort of natural terrain that slows or impedes movement at his normal speed without suffering any sort of impairment. If a skill check, such as Climb or Swim, would normally be required to move through the terrain, this ability does not help.

\cf{Rgr}{Tenacious Hunter (Ex)} At 5th level, a ranger's ability to pursue his quarry improves. He adds his quarry bonus to his dodge defense modifier and his special defenses against attacks that his quarry makes.

\cf{Rgr}{Guide (Ex)} At 7th level, whenever the ranger is in his favored terrain, all allies that can see and hear the ranger gain his favored terrain bonuses in that terrain as well.

\cf{Rgr}{Darkvision (Ex)} At 8th level, a ranger's sight improves again, and he gains the ability to see even when there is no light at all. He gains darkvision out to 60 feet, as the dwarf ability. If he already has darkvision, he increases its range by 60 feet.

\cf{Rgr}{Favored Terrain (Planar) (Ex)} After 10th level, a ranger may choose any plane as a favored terrain in addition to his normal options whenever he gains a new favored terrain. He is immune to any hostile planar effects from any plane he has chosen as favored terrain. In addition, he gains a \plus2 bonus to Knowledge checks relating to the plane and is always treated as trained in Knowledge (planar) for the purpose of such checks.

\cf{Rgr}{Hidden Hunter (Su)} At 11th level, the ranger becomes even more difficult for his quarry to detect. He adds his quarry bonus to his Stealth checks against his quarry. In addition, he continuously benefits from the effect of the \spell{nondectection} spell against all attempts that his quarry makes to detect him magically. The effect uses a caster level equal to his ranger level \add his Wisdom.

\cf{Rgr}{Advanced Ranger Lore} After 12th level, the ranger can choose an advanced ranger lore in place of a regular ranger lore. All advanced lore abilities are extraordinary abilities unless otherwise indicated. His options for advanced ranger lores are listed below.

\subcf{Camouflage}\label{Camouflage} The ranger can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain does not grant cover or concealment.

\subcf{Combat Style Mastery} The ranger's abilities with traditional ranger combat styles reach their peak. When using a ranged weapon, he can take a move action to study the weak points of a foe within one range increment. If he does, the next attack he makes against that foe is made as a touch attack, if it is made within 1 round. When wielding two weapons at once, he gains the pounce ability, allowing him to take a full attack action at the end of a charge.

The ranger must have the greater combat style lore to choose this lore. The benefits apply only if the ranger is wearing light or no armor.

\subcf{Greater Combat Style} The ranger's abilities with traditional ranger combat styles improves again. He gains the Two-Weapon Rend and Manyshot feats if he meets the prerequisites (see \pcref{Two-Weapon Rend} and \pcref{Manyshot}). He must have the improved combat style lore to choose this lore. The benefits of this lore only apply if the ranger is wearing light or no armor.

\subcf{Hail of Arrows} A number of times per day equal to 1 \add half the ranger's Constitution, he may take a full-round action to fire a single projectile at every enemy within a \areamed radius. All enemies must be within one range increment of the ranger. This lore can be used with any projectile weapon that the ranger can reload as a free action.

\subcf{Improved Evasion} The ranger's ability to avoid damage improves. He still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, but henceforth he takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion. He must have the evasion lore to choose this lore. 

\subcf{Storm of Blades} A number of times per day equal to 1 \add half the ranger's Constitution, he may take a standard action to make a single melee attack against every enemy he threatens.

\cf{Rgr}{Blindsense (Ex)} At 12th level, a ranger's perceptions are so finely honed that he can sense his enemies without seeing them. He gains the blindsense ability out to 60 feet. This ability allows him to sense the presence and location of objects and foes within 60 feet without seeing them. If he already has the blindsense ability, he increases its range by 60 feet.

\cf{Rgr}{Terrain Mastery (Ex)} At 13th level, a ranger gains a greater degree of mastery over some of his favored terrains. He chooses a single kind of terrain that he has already chosen as a favored terrain. At 17th level, he chooses an additional kind of terrain to master.
\par While in that terrain, his bonuses on Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks increase to \plus4. In addition, he gains another ability based on that terrain that is constantly active, whether or not he is currently in the terrain. The options for terrain masteries are given below.
\subcf{Aquatic} The ranger gains a swim speed equal to his base land speed. If he already has a swim speed, he increases his swim speed by 10 feet.
\subcf{Cold} The ranger becomes immune to fatigue.
\subcf{Desert} The ranger becomes immune to fatigue.
\subcf{Forest} The ranger may use his wild speech ability to communicate with plants, as the druid ability.
\subcf{Mountains} The ranger gains a climb speed equal to his land speed. If he already has a climb speed, he increases his climb speed by 10 feet.
\subcf{Plains} The ranger increases his land speed by 10 feet.
\subcf{Swamp} The ranger becomes immune to nausea.
\subcf{Underground} The ranger increases the range of his darkvision and blindsense by 60 feet.
\subcf{Urban} The ranger can use the Stealth skill to hide behind creatures granting him active cover, just like he can hide behind passive cover. 

\cf{Rgr}{Blindsight (Ex)} At 16th level, a ranger gains the ability to ``see'' perfectly without his eyes in a 60 foot radius around him. With this ability, he can fight just as well with his eyes closed as with them open. If he already has the blindsight ability, he increases its range by 60 feet.

\cf{Rgr}{Unerring Hunter (Su)} At 17th level, a ranger's ability to hunt down his quarry improves to supernatural levels. Once per day, the ranger may concentrate for a full round to duplicate the effects of the \spell{discern location} spell targeted at his quarry.

\cf{Rgr}{Hide in Plain Sight (Ex)} While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide even while being observed, taking a \minus5 penalty to the Stealth check. He still needs cover or concealment to hide.

If the ranger has the Camouflage ranger lore (see \pcref{Camouflage}), this allows the ranger to attempt to hide in almost any situation, as long as he is in one of his favored terrains.

\cf{Rgr}{Perfect Stride (Su)} At 19th level, a ranger's ability to surpass obstacles becomes unparalleled. He constantly acts as if he were under the effect of a \spell{freedom} spell, except that it does not allow him to act normally underwater.

\cf{Rgr}{Truesight (Su)} At 20th level, a ranger's perceptions are accurate enough to defeat even powerful magic. He gains the ability to see all things as they actually are, as the \spell{true seeing} spell, out to a range of 60 feet.

\sssecfake{Class Skills}
The rogue's class skills (and the key attribute for each skill) are
Athletics (Str), Climb (Str), Swim (Str), Acrobatics (Dex), Escape Artist (Dex),  Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Craft (Int), Devices (Int), Disguise (Int), Forgery (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Bluff (Cha), Persuasion (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), and Perform (Cha).
\cf{Rog}{Skill Points at 1st Level} 8.

\sssecfake{Class Features}
All of the following are class features of the rogue.

\cf{Rog}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency} Rogues are proficient with simple weapons, any two weapon groups, light armor, and bucklers. They are also proficient with saps.

\cf{Rog}{Sneak Attack} If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. She can choose to deal 1d6 points of extra damage if the target is flat-footed or is suffering overwhelm penalties from being surrounded by enemies (see \pcref{Overwhelm}).

This extra damage is only dealt the first time that the rogue makes a sneak attack against that particular creature in the encounter. Additional sneak attacks against the same creature deal no additional damage.

The extra damage increases by 1d6 at 3rd level and every two levels thereafter. Unlike most damage bonuses, this extra damage is not multiplied if the rogue scores a critical hit.

\par Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. A rogue can't strike with deadly accuracy from beyond that range.

With a sap (blackjack) or an unarmed strike, a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual \minus4 penalty.

A rogue can only sneak attack creatures with a discernible body structure -- oozes, incorporeal creatures, and some plants lack vital areas to attack. Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks. The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach.

\cf{Rog}{Danger Sense (Ex)} Starting at 2nd level, a rogue has an intuitive sense that alerts her to danger, giving her a \plus2 bonus to initiative checks. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter.
\par If a character has danger sense from a multiple classes, the character stacks those levels to determine her bonus from danger sense.

\cf{Rog}{Skill Talent (Ex)} At 2nd level, the rogue's skills improve. She gains an additional skill point, which she can place in any skill, and a bonus skill feat for which she qualifies. At 6th level, and every four levels thereafter, she gains an additional skill point and skill feat.

\cf{Rog}{Uncanny Dodge (Ex)} Starting at 3rd level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She may apply her Dexterity and dodge defense modifier to her physical defenses while flat-footed.

If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she stacks those levels to determine whether she gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.

\cf{Rog}{Combat Tricks} As a rogue gains experience, she learns a small number of tricks that aid her and confound her foes. At 4th level, a rogue gains a combat trick. All combat tricks are (Ex) abilities unless otherwise noted.

Tricks marked with an asterisk are called ambush tricks. Ambush tricks only function on the first sneak attack the rogue makes against a particular creature in an encounter. If an ambush trick allows a saving throw, the DC is 10 \add the rogue's level \add the rogue's Intelligence.

At 8th level, and every four levels thereafter, the rogue gains an additional combat trick. Some combat tricks have minimum rogue levels, as indicated in the name of the ability. The list of combat tricks are given below.

\subcf{Brutal Ambush*} The rogue rolls d8s instead of d6s for her sneak attack dice. This is an ambush attack, and only functions once per creature.

\subcf{Combat Feat} The rogue gains a combat feat for which she qualifies (see Feats). This trick can be selected multiple times.

\subcf{Distracting Attack} A creature damaged by the rogue's sneak attack takes a penalty on its Concentration checks equal to number of sneak attack dice the rogue would roll. This penalty lasts for 5 rounds.

\subcf{Evasion} If the rogue makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.

\subcf{Distant Precision} The rogue can make sneak attacks from up to 100 feet away.

\subcf{Merciful Blows} The rogue suffers no penalty to physical attacks when attacking for nonlethal damage, and can deal her full sneak attack damage when attacking nonlethally.

\subcf{Swift Poisoner} The rogue can apply poison to a weapon she is holding as a swift action.

\subcf{Tricky Maneuver} When performing a maneuver against a creature she would be able to sneak attack, the rogue gains a bonus to attack equal to the number of sneak attack dice she would roll. The benefits of this trick apply even against creatures immune to critical hits.

\subcf{8th -- Bewildering Ambush*} A creature damaged by this sneak attack is bewildered for 5 rounds, making it vulnerable. A vulnerable creature takes a \minus2 penalty to attacks, defenses, and checks. This is an ambush attack, and only functions once per creature.

\subcf{8th -- Defensive Roll} When the rogue would take physical damage that reduces her to 0 hit points, she can attempt to roll with the blow to reduce the damage. As an immediate action, she can make a Reflex save with a DC equal to the damage dealt. Success means she takes half damage, and the damage is nonlethal. Failure means she takes full damage. She must be aware of the attack to use this ability. The evasion and improved evasion abilities do not help in any way. This ability can be used number of times per day equal to 1 \add half the rogue's Constitution (minimum 1).

\subcf{8th -- Hamstring*} A creature damaged by this sneak attack has its land speed halved for 5 rounds. Despite the name, this can be used on creatures who do not have hamstrings. This is an ambush attack, and only works once per creature.

\subcf{8th -- Slippery Mind} If the rogue fails a saving throw against a mind-affecting spell or effect, she can make another saving throw 1 round later against the same DC. Success means she is treated as having succeeded against the spell's saving throw, allowing her to end any ongoing effects from the spell. This does not help against instantaneous effects, and does not affect spell resistance.

\subcf{12th -- Ambush Strike*} If the rogue uses a Strike feat (see \pcref{Strike Feats}) on this sneak attack, she may add her Intelligence to the saving throw DC against the strike. This is an ambush attack, and only works once per creature.

\subcf{12th -- Assassination} To use this ability, the rogue must spend a full round studying a creature within 30 feet of her that has not noticed her and who is not in combat. If she make a melee sneak attack against that target within 1 round, her attack deals maximum damage. If the target becomes aware of her presence before she attacks, this ability has no benefit.

\subcf{12th -- Confusing Ambush*} A creature damaged by this sneak attack that is bloodied after the damage is dealt must make a Will save. If it fails, it is confused for 1 round (see \pcref{Confused}). Unlike normal for confusion, the creature does not automatically attack you, even though you attacked it. This is an ambush attack, and only works once per creature, regardless of how the creature is affected.

\subcf{12th -- Dispelling Ambush (Su)*} A creature damaged by this sneak attack is affected by a targeted \spell{dispel magic}. The caster level for this ability is equal to the rogue's level \add her Intelligence. This is an ambush attack, and only works once per creature.

\subcf{12th -- Improved Evasion} This combat trick functions like evasion, except that she also only takes half damage on a failed save. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of improved evasion. 

\subcf{12th -- Perfect Precision} The rogue has no range limit on her sneak attacks. She must the distant precision combat trick to gain this trick.

\subcf{16th -- Crippling Ambush*} A creature damaged by this sneak attack takes Strength damage equal to the rogue's Intelligence. This is an ambush attack, and only works once per creature.

\subcf{16th -- Deadly Ambush*} A creature damaged by this sneak attack that is bloodied after the damage is dealt must make a Fortitude save. If it fails, it dies. If the creature is not bloodied, it suffers no ill effect. This is an ambush attack, and only works once per creature, regardless of how the creature is affected.

\subcf{16th -- Hide in Plain Sight} The rogue can use the Stealth skill to hide even while being observed, taking a \minus5 penalty to the Stealth check. She still needs cover or concealment to hide.

\subcf{16th -- Paralyzing Ambush*} A creature damaged by this sneak attack that is bloodied after the damage is dealt must make a Fortitude save. If it fails, it is paralyzed for 5 rounds. If the creature is not bloodied, it suffers no ill effect. This is an ambush attack, and only works once per creature, regardless of how the creature is affected.

\subcf{16th -- Opportunist} Once per round, the rogue can make an attack of opportunity against a creature that has just taken physical damage from another creature's attack. This attack counts as one of the rogue's attacks of opportunity for that round.

\subcf{20th -- Dual Ambush} The rogue can apply the benefits of two ambush attacks to a single sneak attack.

\subcf{20th -- Lingering Ambush} The rogue increases the duration of the effects of her ambush attacks by a multiplier of 10. This has no effect on ambush attacks that have no duration.

\cf{Rog}{Persistent Sneak Attack (Ex)} At 5th level, the rogue learns how to strike vital spots more consistently. She gains half her sneak attack dice (rounded down) when making sneak attacks against a creature she has already successfully dealt sneak attack damage to in the encounter. For example, a 5th level rogue would deal 3d6 points of extra damage on her first sneak attack against a creature, and 1d6 points of damage on every subsequent sneak attack against the same creature.

\cf{Rog}{Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)} At 6th level and higher, a rogue can no longer be overwhelmed as easily; she can react to multiple opponents as easily as she can react to a single attacker. The rogue is always treated as being threatened by two fewer creatures than she actually is for the purpose of determining overwhelm penalties. 

\par If a character already has improved uncanny dodge from a second class and gains improved uncanny dodge, the character stacks those levels to determine if she should gain greater uncanny dodge.

\cf{Rog}{Greater Uncanny Dodge (Ex)} At 10th level and higher, a rogue can no longer be overwhelmed, regardless of the number of foes surrounding her.

\cf{Rog}{Skill Exemplar (Ex)} At 13th level, the rogue gains a \plus5 bonus with a single skill of her choice. At 17th level, she may gain this bonus with an additional skill.

\cf{Rog}{Endless Sneak Attack (Ex)} At 20th level, the rogue deals full sneak attack damage on her first successful sneak each round against the same creature, rather than only on her first sneak attack in the encounter against that creature.

\sssecfake{Class Skills}
The sorcerer's class skills (and the key attribute for each skill) are Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (the planes), Spellcraft (Wis), and Intimidate (Cha).
\cf{Sor}{Skill Points at 1st Level} 2.

\sssecfake{Class Features}
All of the following are class features of the sorcerer.

 \cf{Sor}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}  Sorcerers are proficient with simple weapons  and one other weapon group.  They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a sorcerer's arcane gestures, which can cause his spells with somatic components to fail.

\cf{Sor}{Spells} A sorcerer casts arcane spells using his Charisma.  To learn or cast a spell, a sorcerer must have a Charisma at least equal to the spell's level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a sorcerer's spell is 10 \add half the sorcerer's caster level \add his Charisma.

Like other spellcasters, the number of spells a sorcerer knows and can cast each day is limited. These limitations are given below on \trefnp{Sorcerer Spells per Day} and \trefnp{Sorcerer Spells Known}. A sorcerer's spells are drawn from the common spells on the sorcerer/wizard spell list (see \pcref{Sorcerer/Wizard Spells}). Sorcerers need to rest for eight hours in order to regain spells.

\cf{Sor}{Rituals} Sorcerers, like other spellcasters, can perform rituals to create unique magical effects (see \pcref{Rituals}). A sorcerer begins play with a ritual book containing one arcane ritual of his choice (see \pcref{Arcane Rituals}).

\cf{Sor}{Arcane Invocation} All sorcerers master at least one arcane invocation. An arcane invocation allows a sorcerer to exert magical influence without expending the effort required to cast a spell. The sorcerer may choose to learn one invocation of her choice from the list of arcane invocations described in Chapter 11: Spells. At 2nd level, the sorcerer learns a second arcane invocation of his choice.

\cf{Sor}{Spellsurge (Ex)} At 2nd level, a sorcerer learns how to alter how he casts spells by initiating a spellsurge. He can initiate a spellsurge as a swift action. While in a spellsurge, he gains bonuses with some types of magic or aspects of spellcasting, but takes penalties to others. A spellsurge lasts for 5 rounds. A sorcerer can attempt to end a spellsurge as a swift action by making a Will save against a DC equal to 10 \add his caster level (including any bonuses or penalties from the spellsurge that affect all spells). Success means he ends the spellsurge, and failure means he is unable to return to normal.

The value of the numerical bonuses and penalties granted by a spellsurge is called a sorcerer's spellsurge bonus. Initially, his spellsurge bonus is \plus2, granting him \plus2 bonuses and inflicting \minus2 penalties. A sorcerer can initiate a spellsurge a number of times per day equal to his spellsurge bonus. His spellsurge bonus improves to \plus3 at 8th level, to \plus4 at 14th level, and finally to \plus5 at 20th level.

At 6th level, and every four levels thereafter, the sorcerer learns an additional spellsurge. Some spellsurges have minimum sorcerer levels, as indicated before the name of the ability. The list of spellsurges is given below.

\subcf{Brilliant Surge} The sorcerer gains a bonus to his caster level with light spells, but takes a penalty to his caster level with Illusion spells.
\subcf{Empathic Surge} The sorcerer gains a bonus to caster level with mind-affecting spells, but takes a penalty to Will saves and to caster level with spells that deal damage.
\subcf{Energetic Surge} The sorcerer gains a bonus to caster level with acid, cold, electricity, and fire spells, but takes a penalty to his caster level with other spells.
\subcf{6th -- Focused Surge} The sorcerer gains a bonus to his concentration checks, but takes a penalty to his caster level with all spells.
\subcf{6th -- Patient Surge} The sorcerer gains a bonus to his caster level with all spells, but all spells he casts require at least a full-round action to cast. This does not increase the casting time of spells with a casting time of a full-round action or longer.
\subcf{10th -- Extending Surge} The sorcerer doubles the range on all his spells, but takes a penalty to his caster level with all spells.
\subcf{10th -- Silent Surge} The sorcerer can cast spells as if they did not have verbal components, but takes a penalty to his caster level with all spells.
\subcf{10th -- Stilled Surge} The sorcerer can cast spells as if they did not have somatic components, but takes a penalty to his caster level with all spells. 
\subcf{14th -- Lifebound Surge} The sorcerer gains a bonus to his caster level with all spells, but takes 1 point of Constitution damage each time he casts a spell.
\subcf{14th -- Lingering Surge} The sorcerer gains a bonus to his caster level with spells that have a non-instantaneous duration, but takes a penalty to caster level with spells that are instantaneous.
\subcf{14th -- Resistant Surge} Whenever the sorcerer casts a spell, he gains spell resistance for 1 round. However, he takes a penalty to his caster level with all spells. A creature with spell resistance may always make a saving throw when a spell is cast on it. The saving throw type is indicated by the spell. If the creature succeeds, the spell has no effect on it.
\subcf{18th -- Widening Surge} The sorcerer doubles the area affected by his spells that affect an area, but takes a penalty to his caster level with all spells.

\cf{Sor}{Expanded Spell Knowledge (Ex)} At 3rd level, and every odd level afterwards, a sorcerer can learn how to cast a particularly esoteric spell. He may choose a restricted spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list with a level of no more than half his sorcerer level (normally, the highest level spell he can cast) and add it to his spell list. He must still use a spell known to learn it, as normal.

\cf{Sor}{Spellblend Invocation (Ex)} At 4th level, a sorcerer may combine his arcane invocations with his spells. As a full-round action, the sorcerer may cast a spell that affects only himself using a spell slot one level higher than what the spell would normally require. The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less. If he does, he may also use an arcane invocation as part of the same action. The arcane invocation need not target the sorcerer.

\cf{Sor}{Defensive Spellblend (Ex)} At 8th level, a sorcerer may combine two spells together. As a full-round action, the sorcerer may cast two spells at once, resolving each spell's effects separately. The spells cast in this way must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less, and must be at least three spell levels apart, such as a 1st-level spell and a 4th-level spell. In addition, one of the two spells must affect only the sorcerer. Using improved spellblend costs a spell slot of one level higher than the highest level spell being cast.

\cf{Sorc}{Versatile Spellcaster (Ex)} At 10th level, a sorcerer's intuitive grasp of magic allows him to be flexible in his use of arcane energy. He can use two sorcerer spell slots of the same level to cast a spell or use an ability requiring a sorcerer spell slot of one level higher.

\cf{Sor}{Offensive Spellblend (Ex)} At 12th level, a sorcerer may combine a damaging spell and a nondamaging spell together. As a full-round action, the sorcerer may cast two spells at once, resolving each spell's effects separately. The spells cast in this way must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less, and must at least three spell levels apart, such as a 1st-level spell and a 4th-level spell. One spell must be a damaging spell, and the other must not. Using offensive spellblend costs a spell slot of two levels higher than the highest level spell being cast.

\cf{Sor}{Endless Surge (Ex)} At 16th level, there is no limit to the duration of a sorcerer's spellsurge ability. If a spellsurge lasts longer than 5 rounds, he automatically succeeds on any Will save he makes to end the surge.

\cf{Sor}{Dual Surge (Ex)} At 20th level, a sorcerer may enter two spellsurges at once. He gains the benefits and suffers the consequences of both surges. However, while using two surges at once, he takes a \minus5 penalty to Will saves to end a spellsurge.

\cd{Alignment} Any.

\cd{Hit Value} 5.

\ssecfake{Class Skills}
The spellwarped's class skills (and the key attribute for each skill) are Swim (Str), Ride (Dex), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Spellcraft (Wis), and Intimidate (Cha). He gains additional class skills based on his choice of innate magic.
\cf{Spl}{Skill Points at 1st Level} 4.

\sssecfake{Class Features}
All of the following are class features of the spellwarped.

\cf{Spl}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
A spellwarped is proficient with simple weapons, any two weapon groups, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).

\cf{Spl}{Innate Magic (Ex)} Each spellwarped draws his power from a particular kind of magic. This is a choice made when the first level of the class is taken, and it cannot thereafter be changed. The choices are listed below.
\subcf{Alteration} The spellwarped can manipulate the physical forms of creatures. His good save is Fortitude, his key attribute is Intelligence, and he treats Athletics, Escape Artist, and Disguise as class skills. An alteration spellwarped may be called an alterer, bodywarper, or shifter.
\subcf{Pyromancy} The spellwarped can manipulate fire and heat. His good save is Will, his key attribute is Charisma, and he treats Acrobatics, Athletics, and Perform as class skills. A pyromancy spellwarped may be called a pyromancer.
\subcf{Telekinesis} The spellwarped can manipulate objects and creatures with his mind. His good save is Will, his key attribute is Intelligence, and he treats Craft, Devices, and Sleight of Hand as class skills. A telekinesis spellwarped may be called a telekine.
\subcf{Temporal} The spellwarped can manipulate time. His good save is Reflex, his key attribute is Wisdom, and he treats Acrobatics, Perception, and Sleight of Hand as class skills. A temporal spellwarped may be called a temporalist or timewarper.

\cf{Spl}{Spellwarp Pool (Su)} A spellwarped has the ability to tap into the latent magic within his body to generate magical effects. He has a maximum number of spellwarp points equal to half his spellwarped level \add his Constitution (minimum 1 point). Each hour, he regains a number of spellwarp points equal to his key attribute. As long as he has at least one spellwarp point remaining, he gains a minor ability based on his choice of magic.
\subcf{Alteration -- Alter Appearance} The spellwarped can change minor aspects of his appearance at will -- removing a mole or lengthening his beard slightly. This can grant him a \plus2 bonus to Disguise checks. Major changes are not possible.
\subcf{Pyromancy -- Ember} The spellwarped can snap his fingers as a swift action to create a small ember of flame in his hand for 5 minutes. This ember casts light as a torch, and can deal 1 point of fire damage with a successful touch attack. The ember can be dismissed as a swift action or extinguished as a move action.
\subcf{Telekinesis -- Object Manipulation} The spellwarped can concentrate as a standard action to move objects within five feet of him telekinetically. He can slowly lift or manipulate one object by up to one foot per round. The object can weigh up to five pounds. This level of control is insufficient to make skill checks or wield a weapon or shield effectively.
\subcf{Temporal -- Time Awareness} The spellwarped always knows exactly what time it is, and can track the passage of time precisely without effort.

\cf{Spl}{Invoke Power (Su)} A spellwarped can invoke his innate magic to generate powerful effects by spending a spellwarp point. If a saving throw is allowed, the DC is equal to 10 \add the spellwarped's class level \add his key attribute. He chooses a single power at 1st level from those available based on his choice of innate magic. At 4th level, and every two levels thereafter, he gains an additional power. Some powers require a minimum spellwarped level before they can be selected, as indicated in their description. The list of powers is given at \pcref{Spellwarped Powers}.

\cf{Spl}{Surge of Power (Su)} At 2nd level, a spellwarped can invoke a surge of magical power that allows him to embody his innate magic more fully for 5 rounds. To invoke a surge of power, he must spend a spellwarp point as a a swift action. The effect of his surge depends on his choice of innate magic, as described below.
\subcf{Alteration -- Alter Body} The spellwarped enhances his physical ability. He gains a \plus2 enhancement bonus to a physical attribute of his choice. This bonus increases by 1 at 8th, 14th, and 20th level.
\subcf{Pyromancy -- Flame Aura} The spellwarped emanates an aura of fire for 5 rounds. At the start of each of his turns, creatures adjacent to him take one point of fire damage per spellwarped level.
\subcf{Telekinesis -- Kinetic Deflection} The spellwarped reflexibly deflects attacks away with his mind. He gains a \plus2 bonus to his shield defense modifier. This bonus stacks with the bonus from using a shield. At 8th, 14th, and 20th level, the shield bonus increases by 1.
\subcf{Temporal -- Accelerate Movement} The spellwarped accelerates his movement and reactions. He gains a \plus2 enhancement bonus to his dodge defense modifier and a \plus10 foot enhancement bonus to his movement speed. At 8th, 14th, and 20th level, the dodge bonus increases by 1 and the speed bonus increases by 10 feet.

\cf{Spl}{Spellwarped Body (Ex)} At 2nd level, a spellwarped's body is fundamentally altered by exposure to magic. He shows signs of the magic coursing through his body: strangely or inconsistently colored hair, natural skin markings which often resemble runes, and so on. Anyone observing the spellwarped can make a Perception or Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 20 \sub the spellwarped's class level to recognize that the character is a spellwarped. In addition, the spellwarped gains an ability based on his innate magic.
\subcf{Alteration -- Augment Skin} The spellwarped gains a \plus1 bonus to his natural armor modifier. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter.
\subcf{Pyromancy -- Energy Resistance} The spellwarped gains cold and fire damage reduction equal to twice his spellwarped level, allowing him to ignore the first points of cold or fire damage he takes each round.
\subcf{Telekinesis -- Tactile Telekinesis} The spellwarped gains a \plus1 bonus to Strength and Dexterity-based skill checks. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter.
\subcf{Temporal -- Accelerate Reaction} The spellwarped gains a \plus2 bonus to initiative checks. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter.

\cf{Spl}{Attuned Senses (Su)} At 3rd level, the spellwarped learns to recognize the telltale signs of his chosen magic. He must concentrate as a standard action to use this ability, and he may do so any number of times per day.
\subcf{Alteration -- Perceive Alteration} The spellwarped can discern the true form of all creatures within 50 feet of him for 1 round, ignoring any effects which magically alter their shapes. This also grants him a \plus5 bonus to Perception checks to see through disguises.
\subcf{Pyromancy -- Flame of Life} The spellwarped can see the life-fire that lies within all living creatures, allowing him to clearly see all living creatures within 50 feet of him for 1 round. This ability can reveal creatures hiding in concealment and defeat figments and glamers such as \spell{invisibility}, but does not reveal creatures hiding behind cover. It also allows the spellwarped to see unusually warm objects, such as fires.
\subcf{Telekinesis -- Spatial Awareness} The spellwarped can feel the forms of all objects and creatures around him, granting blindsense out to a 50 foot range for 1 round.
\subcf{Temporal -- Accelerated Search} The spellwarped can accelerate his mind to immediately search everything within a 10 foot radius of him with the Perception skill as a standard action. Alternately, he may use this ability to read a book ten times as fast as normal.

\cf{Spl}{Spellwarped Aspect (Su)} At 3rd level, the spellwarped gains a new ability based on his continued exposure to magical energy. Most aspects are specific to particular kinds of innate magic, but some aspects can be taken by any spellwarped. These aspects are listed under the General heading.  At 7th level, and every four levels thereafter, the spellwarped gains an additional spellwarped aspect. Some aspects require a minimum spellwarped level, as indicated below. The full list of spellwarped aspects is given below.

\parhead{General}
\subcf{Spellwarped Soul} The spellwarped may use his character level in place of his spellwarped level to determine the effects of his spellwarped abilities, including damage dealt and saving throw DCs. This does not affect the number of spellwarp points he has available.
\subcf{7th -- Expanded Senses} The range of the spellwarped's attuned senses ability doubles.
\subcf{11th -- Accelerated Recovery} The spellwarped regains spellwarp points once per 10 minutes, rather than once per hour.
\subcf{11th -- Rapid Senses} The spellwarped can constantly gain the benefit of his attuned senses ability. He can toggle his enhanced senses on or off as a swift action. If the ability does not have a duration, such as the temporal attuned senses ability, this aspect has no effect.

\parhead{Alteration}
\subcf{Damage Reduction} The spellwarped gains physical damage reduction against his choice of piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage. The amount of damage resisted is equal to half his class level, allowing him to ignore the first points of damage he takes each round. If he is hit by an adamantine weapon, he cannot use his damage reduction for 1 round.
\subcf{7th -- Improved Damage Reduction} The spellwarped's damage reduction applies against all forms of physical damage. The spellwarped must have the damage reduction aspect to gain this aspect.
\subcf{7th -- Alter Movement} The spellwarped gains his choice of the Legendary Balance, Legendary Climber, Legendary Leaper, or Legendary Swimmer feats, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. He may select this aspect multiple times, choosing a different bonus feat each time.
\subcf{11th -- Alter Size} When the spellwarped uses his surge of power, he can increase or decrease by a size category, as he chooses. The size alteration lasts as long as his surge of power does. This is a size-affecting effect, and does not stack with other size-affecting effects.
\subcf{15th -- Fast Healing} While his surge of power is active, the spellwarped gains fast healing equal to half his spellwarped level, allowing him to heal damage each round. This does not affect critical damage.

\parhead{Pyromancy}
\subcf{Improved Ember} When the spellwarped uses his ember ability, he can strengthen the fire so that it illuminates up to a 40 foot radius with bright illumination. He can also throw the ember up to 100 feet. It burns for up to 5 rounds on its own before becoming extinguished.
\subcf{Intense Flames} The spellwarped's attacks can ignore an amount of fire damage reduction equal to his spellwarped level \add his Charisma.
\subcf{7th -- Flame Eater} When the spellwarped resists fire damage with his spellwarped body ability, he gains temporary hit points equal to the damage resisted for 5 minutes.

\parhead{Telekinesis}
\subcf{Improved Object Manipulation} When the spellwarped uses his object manipulation ability, he can affect objects within 10 feet, with a weight limit of up to two pounds per spellwarped level. He has enough control to make skill checks with a DC of up to 10.
\subcf{7th -- Shieldbearer} The spellwarped may wield shields, except tower shields, telekinetically. The shield floats in his square, granting him its bonus to his shield defense modifier. He does not need a free hand to wield the shield and suffers no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure from it. The shield follows him as he moves. If it is forcibly removed from his square, he loses control over it and it falls to the ground.
\subcf{11th -- Mind Armory} The spellwarped may control a number of weapons equal to half his Intelligence with his mind blade ability. This does not allow him to make additional attacks per round, but he may attack interchangeably with any weapon he controls. Each weapon threatens an area and contributes to overwhelm penalties, just as with his normal mind blade ability.

\parhead{Temporal}
\subcf{Evasion} If the spellwarped makes a successful Reflex save against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can only be used if the spellwarped is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless spellwarped does not gain the benefit of evasion.
\subcf{Fast Movement} The spellwarped gains a \plus10 foot bonus to movement speed.
\subcf{Uncanny Dodge} The spellwarped may apply his Dexterity and dodge modifier to his physical defenses while flat-footed.
\subcf{7th -- Accelerate Attack} While his surge of power is active, the spellwarped can make an additional attack at a \minus5 penalty when making a full attack.

\cf{Spl}{Resist Magic (Ex)} At 4th level, the power of the magic with the spellwarped offers him some measure of protection against hostile magical effects. He gains a \plus1 bonus to special defenses against spells and spell-like abilities. This bonus increases by \plus1 at 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter.

\cf{Spl}{Manipulate Magic (Su)} At 5th level, the spellwarped can channel his innate magic to manipulate other forms of magic. Using this ability costs a spellwarp point. 
\subcf{Alteration -- Absorption} As an immediate action, when the spellwarped makes a successful Fortitude save against a spell or spell-like ability, he may absorb its energy harmlessly into his body. The spell has no effect on him, even if the spell would normally have an effect on a successful saving throw.
\subcf{Pyromancy -- Fuel the Flame} As an immediate action, when the spellwarped is affected by a spell or spell-like ability, he may channel its energy into a burst of flame around him. Creatures within a \areasmall radius of the spellwarped take fire damage equal to your spellwarped level. The spell still has its normal effect on the spellwarped.
\subcf{Telekinesis -- Mind over Matter} As an immediate action, when the spellwarped is affected by a spell or spell-like ability which allows a Fortitude save, he may make a Will save instead.
\subcf{Temporal -- Accelerate Magic} As a swift action, the spellwarped can increase or decrease the duration of any spell or spell-like ability affecting him by two rounds. This can end the effect immediately if it has no time remaining. The spellwarped can't increase the duration beyond twice the spell's original duration.

\cf{Spl}{Spell Resistance (Ex)} At 9th level, the magic within the spellwarped allows him to completely ignore other magic, granting him spell resistance. A creature with spell resistance may always make a saving throw when a spell is cast on it. The saving throw type is indicated by the spell. If the creature succeeds, the spell has no effect on it.

\cf{Spl}{Improved Manipulate Magic (Su)} At 13th level, the spellwarped can use his manipulate magic ability to affect any ally within \rngmed range of him.

\cf{Spl}{Mass Surge of Power (Su)} At 17th level, the spellwarped can share the benefits of his surge of power with his allies. When he uses his surge of power, he can also affect up to five additional creatures within \rngmed range of him.

\cf{Spl}{Permanent Surge of Power (Su)} At 19th level, the spellwarped can maintain the full power of his innate magic without limit. He can gain the effects of his surge of power indefinitely. He may toggle the ability on or off as a swift action at will, without expending spellwarp points. This does not allow him to activate his mass surge of power ability at will, and his allies only gain the benefits for 5 rounds.

\ssecfake{Spellwarped Powers}\label{Spellwarped Powers}
As the spellwarped increases in level, he may choose more advanced spellwarped powers, listed below.

\subsubsection{Alteration Powers}
\parhead{1st -- Lesser Reduction} A creature within \rngclose range becomes one size category smaller for 2 rounds unless it makes a Fortitude save. It takes a \minus2 penalty to Strength, decreases its weapon damage dice by one size, and takes a \minus4 penalty to maneuvers and Maneuver Class. However, it gains a \plus2 bonus to Stealth checks and a \plus1 bonus to physical attacks and defenses. This is a size-affecting effect.
\parhead{4th -- Reduction} This power functions like the lesser reduction power, except that the foe is reduced for 5 rounds.
\parhead{6th -- Purge} The spellwarped can make a Fortitude save to end any effects or conditions on him which allow a Fortitude save to resist. If he can make a Spellcraft check to identify the effects on him, he may freely choose which effects not to end, allowing him to retain beneficial effects.
\parhead{8th -- Body Bludgeon} The spellwarped elongates and distorts a part of his body and strikes a foe with it. The foe must be within his reach, as if he were wielding a reach weapon. He must make a physical attack with that part of his body. If he hits, he deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage per spellwarped level \add his Strength. In addition, whether he hits or misses, he may make a bull rush attack on the creature that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. He need not move with the creature to push it back.
\parhead{8th -- Enlargement} This power functions like the \spell{enlarge person} spell, except that it can affect creatures of any type.
\parhead{10th -- Amorphous Body} The spellwarped transforms his body into an amorphous form for 1 round. In this form, he gains several benefits. He gains a \plus20 bonus against grapple attacks, is immune to critical hits, takes no penalties for squeezing, and can move through spaces that are no more than two inches in width, though doing so forces him to move at half speed.
\parhead{10th -- Heal Wounds} As a standard action, the spellwarped can spend two spellwarp points to remove his own injuries by transforming himself into a healthier version of his body. He heals 1d6 points of damage per spellwarped level. This also removes any of the following conditions: blinded, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, sickened, and poisoned.
\parhead{12th -- Baleful Polymorph} This attack functions like the \spell{baleful polymorph} spell.
\parhead{14th -- Flight} As a swift action, the spellwarped can spend two spellwarp points to grow wings to fly for 5 rounds. His fly speed is equal to his base land speed, and his maneuverability is good. See \pcref{Flying}, for more details. At the end of the duration, the wings are subsumed back into his body. This ability is draining to use, and the spellwarped must wait for five minutes after using it before he can use it again.
\parhead{14th -- Greater Amorphous Body} This power functions like the amorphous form power, except that it costs two spellwarp points and lasts for 5 rounds.
\parhead{16th -- Bludgeon the Horde} This attack functions like the body bludgeon attack, except that he may attack all foes within his reach, as if he were wielding a reach weapon. He deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage per two spellwarped levels \add his Strength to each foe.
\parhead{18th -- }
\parhead{20th -- }

\subsubsection{Pyromancy Powers}
\parhead{1st -- Lesser Ignite} As a standard action, the spellwarped can ignite a foe within \rngclose range, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage \add 1 per spellwarped level. A successful Reflex save halves the damage.
\parhead{1st -- Weapon of Flame} As a swift action, the spellwarped can create a weapon made of flame that lasts for 5 rounds. The weapon is sized appropriately for him, and may take the form of any weapon he is proficient with. He can attack with the weapon as if it were a normal weapon of its type, except that he adds half his Charisma to damage in place of half his Strength, and all damage dealt with the weapon is fire damage.
\par The flame weapon gains a \plus1 enhancement bonus to attack and damage at 4th level. At 7th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, the bonus increases by 1. If it leaves his hand, it is extinguished 1 round later.
\parhead{4th -- Ignite} This attack functions like the lesser ignite attack, except that it deals 1d6 points of fire damage per spellwarped level, and a target that fails its Reflex save is also ignited for 5 rounds. An ignited creature has been set on fire. It is vulnerable, causing it to take a \minus2 penalty to attacks, defenses, and checks. In addition, it takes d6 damage per round from the fire. If the creature takes a move action, it can attempt a DC 15 Reflex save to put out the flames. This action provokes attacks of opportunity. Dropping prone as part of the action gives a \plus4 bonus on this save.
\parhead{6th -- Ignite Weapon} As a swift action, the spellwarped can set one of his weapon on fire for 5 rounds. During this time, the spellwarped adds half his Charisma to damage with the weapon he wields in addition to half his Strength. This bonus damage is fire damage. If ignites a weapon created using his weapon of flame power, he adds his full Charisma to damage with the weapon instead of half his Charisma.
\parhead{6th -- Fiery Protection} As a standard action, the spellwarped can bestow fire and cold damage reduction equal to twice his spellwarped level on a creature within 30 feet of him. The protection lasts for 1 hour.
\parhead{8th -- Conflagration} As a standard action, the spellwarped can release a powerful explosion of flame. All enemies and objects within a \areamed radius spread of him take 1d6 fire damage per two spellwarped levels. A successful Reflex save halves the damage.
\parhead{10th -- Fire Shield} As a standard action, the spellwarped can wreath himself in flame for 5 rounds. Any creature that hits him with its body or a melee weapon takes 1d6 fire damage per two spellwarped levels. Each individual creature can take this damage only once per round.
\parhead{10th -- Flameheart} As a standard action, the spellwarped can become a being of pure fire for 1 round. In this form, he is immune to physical damage and can pass through openings as small as one inch at no movement penalty. However, he cannot attack normally or use any of his items, as they meld into his body. He may invoke any of his spellwarped powers normally. In this form, he can make a touch attack as a standard action to deal 1d6 points of fire damage per spellwarped level.
\parhead{12th -- Firestride} As a move action, the spellwarped can may teleport to any active flame of at least Tiny size within \rngmed range. When he does so, he immolates himself and disappears into a pile of ash before stepping out from the flame unharmed. An ordinary torch is sufficient flame to teleport to, but not a candle.
\parhead{14th -- Flight of the Phoenix} As a swift action, the spellwarped can spend two spellwarp points to fly on wings of flame for 5 rounds. His fly speed is equal to his base land speed, and his maneuverability is good. See \pcref{Flying}, for more details. At the end of the duration, the wings are extinguished. This ability is draining to use, and the spellwarped must wait for five minutes after using it before he can use it again.
\parhead{14th -- Greater Flameheart} This power functions like the flameheart power, except that it lasts for 5 rounds.
\parhead{16th -- } 
\parhead{18th -- Phoenix Revival} When the spellwarped takes critical damage, he may spend five spellwarp points as an immediate action, even if the critical damage would be sufficient to kill him. If he does, he ignores the critical damage he just took and dissolves into a pile of ash for 5 rounds. During this time, he can take no actions. If the pile of ash remains intact after 5 rounds, the spellwarped is restored to his normal body, with zero hit points but with all critical damage healed. However, if the pile of ash is dispersed, the spellwarped dies. The ash cannot be harmed by fire damage, and if the pile of ash would take at least 10 points of fire damage during a round, the spellwarped returns one round sooner. The spellwarped may take his normal actions immediately after being restored.
\parhead{20th -- Immolate} The spellwarped consumes the body of a foe within \rngclose range in flames from the inside out. It takes 1d6 points of fire damage per spellwarped level, and if it is bloodied after it takes this damage, it immediately dies. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage and leaves a bloodied creature with 0 hit points.

\subsubsection{Telekinesis Powers}
\parhead{1st -- Lesser Crush} As a standard action, the spellwarped can crush a creature or object within \rngclose range with telekinetic force, dealing 1d6 points of physical damage \add 1 per spellwarped level. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage.
\parhead{1st -- Mind Blade} As a swift action, the spellwarped can telekinetically wield an unattended weapon within \rngclose range for 5 rounds. The weapon must be a light or medium weapon appropriate for his size. This allows him to attack with the weapon just as if he were holding it in one hand, except that he uses his Intelligence in place of his Strength. In all other respects, this functions as if he were wielding the weapon normally, including contributing to overwhelm penalties and taking attacks of opportunity. The weapon floats in midair and threatens all squares adjacent to it, and he may make attacks of opportunity with the weapon or with a weapon he wields in his hands, but not both.
As a move action, he may move the weapon up to 30 feet in any direction, even vertically. If the weapon goes outside of \rngclose range, he loses control of it and it falls to the ground.
\parhead{4th -- Crush} This power functions like the lesser crush attack, except that it deals 1d6 points of physical damage per spellwarped level, and a creature that fails its Fortitude save is also sickened. A sickened creature is vulnerable, causing it to take a \minus2 penalty to attacks, defenses, and checks.
\parhead{4th -- Mighty Mind Blade} This power functions like the mind blade power, except that the spellwarped may also use a heavy weapon appropriate for his size, allowing him to attack with it just as if he were holding it in two hands. The spellwarped must have the mind blade power to select this power.
\parhead{6th -- Distant Manipulation} As a standard action, the spellwarped can mentally exert influence at up to \rngclose range. This allows him to take any standard action which he could normally take with his hands, using his Intelligence in place of his Strength or Dexterity, as appropriate. He may take actions that require more than a standard action to complete by spending the same amount of time concentrating, spending one spellwarp point per two rounds that he spends concentrating.
\subcf{6th -- Dual Mind Blade} This power functions like his mind blade power, except that the spellwarped may wield two weapons at once. They must stay in the same space, and he may make two-weapon fighting attacks with the weapons, just as if he was wielding them with two hands. The spellwarped must have the mind blade power to select this power.
\parhead{8th -- }
\parhead{10th -- Telekinetic Force} This power functions like the \spell{telekinetic force} spell, using his Intelligence as his casting attribute.
\parhead{12th -- Strangle} As a standard action, the spellwarped can spend two spellwarp points to crush the windpipe of a foe within \rngclose range. This deals 1d6 damage per spellwarped level. A creature bloodied after the damage is dealt is nauseated for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the nausea. 
\parhead{14th -- }
\parhead{16th -- } 
\parhead{18th -- }
\parhead{20th -- Mass Strangle} This power functions like the strangle power, except that it costs three spellwarp points and the spellwarped can affect any creatures within a \areasmall radius.

\subsubsection{Temporal Powers}
\parhead{1st -- Lesser Timetheft} As a standard action, the spellwarped can attempt to steal time from an adjacent creature. If the target fails a Will save, it skips its next move action. A bloodied target skips its next standard action instead.
\parhead{4th -- Slow} As a standard action, the spellwarped slows a foe within \rngclose range for 5 rounds unless it makes a Will save. A slowed creature can take only a single move action or standard action each turn, but not both. It cannot take full-round actions, but it may take swift actions. Additionally, it takes a \minus2 penalty to physical attacks and defenses, as well as Strength and Dexterity-based checks.
\parhead{4th -- Timetheft} This power functions like lesser timetheft, except that the spellwarped regains a spellwarp point if the target fails its Will save.
\parhead{6th -- Accelerate Movement} As a standard action, the spellwarped can accelerate a creature within \rngclose range so much that he can seem to pause time for everyone but the subject. This allows the subject to immediately take a single move action. During this move action, the subject does not provoke attacks of opportunity and can move through squares occupied by enemies without penalty. If the spellwarped uses this power on himself, it only requires a move action to activate.
\parhead{8th -- Haste} As a standard action, the spellwarped dramatically accelerates a creature within \rngclose range for 5 rounds. It doubles all of its movement speeds (to a maximum of an additional 30 feet of movement), and can take an additional attack at a \minus5 penalty when it makes a standard attack. The increase to movement speed is considered an enhancement bonus.
\parhead{8th -- Pause Time} The spellwarped completely stops time for a single creature within \rngclose range for 5 rounds. A successful Will save negates the effect. The affected creature can take no actions and cannot be moved, damaged, or even affected in any way until the effect ends. The spellwarped may dismiss the effect as a swift action.
\parhead{10th -- Accelerate Movement, Greater} This power functions like the accelerate movement power, except that it costs two spellwarp points and can be used as a move action. If the spellwarped uses this power on himself, it only requires a swift action to activate.
\parhead{12th -- Timestream} The spellwarped manipulates time in a \arealarge line that extends out from him for 5 rounds. All creatures and objects that pass through the line are slowed for 1 round, with no saving throw allowed. The spellwarped can exclude his allies from the effect. The timestream is virtually invisible, requiring a DC 30 Perception check to notice in a clear environment, though objects passing through the effect can make it obvious.
\parhead{14th -- Inhuman Speed} As a move action, the spellwarped can accelerate himself to immense speed, allowing him to move up to five times his speed. During this time, he does not provoke attacks of opportunity, can move through squares occupied by enemies without penalty, and can treat liquids as if they were solid ground.
\parhead{14th -- Mass Slow} This power functions like the slow power, except that it costs two spellwarp points and affects up to five creatures within \rngclose range of the spellwarped.
\parhead{16th -- Time Reversal} As a swift action, the spellwarped can spend a spellwarp point to create a ``time lock.'' The time lock persists for one round. As a standard action, he can bring a creature backwards through time to the point at which the time lock was created. A Will save negates this effect. An affected creature is perfectly restored to the point immediately after the time lock was created. The effects of any actions that the creature took in the intervening time are undone, any damage it dealt or took is removed, it is restored to its original location, and the creature is restored in all other ways, just as if the intervening time had never occured. The spellwarped cannot reverse time for himself in this way.
\parhead{16th -- Supreme Acceleration} As a standard action, the spellwarped can spend three spellwarp points to accelerate himself so much that he can take an additional round of actions immediately. During this round, all creatures he attacks are treated as helpless, but he cannot perform a coup de grace or similar ability; such an act requires more care and precision than is possible with such immense speed. After using this ability, he must wait 5 rounds before he can use it again.
\parhead{18th -- Mass Haste} This power functions like the haste power, except that it costs two spellwarp points and affects up to five creatures within \rngclose range of the spellwarped.
\parhead{18th -- Time Stop} As a standard action, the spellwarped can spend two spellwarp points to step into an alternate timestream, causing him to speed up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen. He can act for 1d3\plus1 rounds of apparent time. During this time, all objects and creatures are frozen in place and are completely invulnerable to the spellwarped, though he may affect them with spellwarped powers normally. After using this ability, he must wait 5 rounds before he can use it again.
\parhead{20th -- Sever Time} As a standard action, the spellwarped can spend two spellwarp points to completely stop time for a single creature for 5 rounds. This functions like the pause time power, except that no saving throw is allowed.

\sssecfake{Class Skills}
The wizard's class skills (and the key attribute for each skill) are
Knowledge (all skills, taken individually) (Int), Linguistics (Int), and Spellcraft (Wis).
\cf{Wiz}{Skill Points at 1st Level} 4

\sssecfake{Class Features}

All of the following are class features of the wizard.

\cf{Wiz}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency} Wizards are proficient with simple weapons, but not with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a wizard's movements, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.

\cf{Wiz}{Bonus Languages} A wizard may learn Draconic in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race (see Chapter 2: Races). Many ancient tomes of magic are written in Draconic, and apprentice wizards often learn it as part of their studies.

\cf{Wiz}{Spells} A wizard casts arcane spells using her Intelligence. To learn or cast a spell, a wizard must have an Intelligence at least equal to the spell's level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a wizard's spell is 10 \add half the wizard's caster level \add her Intelligence.

Like other spellcasters, the number of spells a wizard knows and can cast each day is limited. These limitations are given below on \trefnp{Wizard Spells per Day} and \trefnp{Wizard Spells Known}. A wizard's spells are drawn from the common spells on the sorcerer/wizard spell list (see \pcref{Sorcerer/Wizard Spells}). Wizards need to rest for eight hours in order to regain spells.

\cf{Wiz}{Rituals} Wizards, like other spellcasters, can perform rituals to create unique magical effects (see \pcref{Rituals}). A wizard begins play with a ritual book containing two arcane rituals of her choice (see \pcref{Arcane Rituals}).

\cf{Wiz}{Arcane Invocation} All wizards master at least one arcane invocation. An arcane invocation allows the wizard to exert magical influence without expending the effort required to cast a spell. The wizard may choose to learn one invocation of her choice from the list of arcane invocations described in Chapter 11: Spells. Specialist wizards must choose one of the invocations granted by their specialist school. At 2nd level, the wizard gains a second arcane invocation, which can be chosen from any non-prohibited school.

\cf{Wiz}{Magic Feat} At 2nd level, a wizard gains a bonus magic feat or metamagic feat of his choice. He must meet the prerequisites for the feat as normal. At 6th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, he gains an additional magic feat or metamagic feat.

\cf{Wiz}{Arcane Insight (Ex)} At 3rd level, and every odd level afterwards, a wizard gains a greater understanding of magic. Generalist wizards gain expanded spell knowledge, as the sorcerer class feature. Specialist wizards may choose a spell of their chosen school from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, including restricted spells, and add it to their spells known. The spell's level must not be higher than half the wizard's class level -- normally, the highest level of spells that the wizard can cast.

\cf{Wiz}{Invocation Sequencer (Ex)} At 4th level, a wizard gains the ability to create a sequence of a spell and invocation which she can cast together later. To create an invocation sequencer, the wizard must cast a spell which affects only herself and an arcane invocation, which may affect any target. The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less. Neither has any effect immediately. The wizard may later use a full-round action to cast both the spell and the invocation at once, choosing the target of the invocation at that time.
\par The wizard may initially have only one sequencer active at any time. At 8th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, she may keep an additional sequencer active at once. If she creates a new sequencer, it replaces one of her previous sequencers. She may choose which old sequencer is replaced.

\cf{Wiz}{Defensive Sequencer (Ex)} At 8th level, a wizard gains the ability to create a sequence of two spells which she can cast rapidly later. To create a defensive sequencer, the wizard must cast two spells, one of which affects only herself. The spells must be at least three levels apart, and both must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less. Neither has any effect immediately. The wizard may later use a full-round action to cast both spells at once, resolving their effects separately. The number of sequencers a wizard may have active at once is limited, as described in the defensive sequencer ability.

\cf{Wiz}{Contingency (Ex)} At 12th level, a wizard gains the ability to prepare a spell so it takes effect automatically if specific circumstances arise. To prepare a contingency, the wizard must spend 1 minute preparing the spell, which consumes the a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's level. During this casting time, the wizard specifies what circumstances cause the spell to take effect.

The contingency can be set to trigger in response to any circumstances that a typical human observing you and your situation could detect. For example, you could specify ``when I fall at least 50 feet'' or ``when I become bloodied,'' but not ``when there is an invisible creature within 50 feet of me'' or ``when I am at 17 hit points or fewer.'' The more specific the required circumstances, the better -- vague requirements, such as ``when I am in danger,'' may cause the contingency to trigger unexpectedly or fail to trigger at all. If you attempt to specify multiple separate triggering conditions, such as ``when I take damage or when an enemy is adjacent to me,'' the contingency will randomly ignore all but one of the conditions.

The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less, and it must target the wizard or have its area centered on the wizard. Any spells which require decisions, such as \spell{dimension door}, must have those decisions made at the time the contingency is created. The wizard cannot change those decisions when the contingency takes effect.

A wizard can have only one contingency active at a time. If he creates another contingency, it replaces his old contingency.

\cf{Wiz}{Offensive Sequencer (Ex)} At 16th level, a wizard gains the ability to create a sequence of two spells which she can cast rapidly later. To create an offensive sequencer, the wizard must cast two spells. The spells must be at least three levels apart, and both must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less. One spell must be a damaging spell, and the other must not. Finally, both spells must be of the same school. Neither has any effect immediately. The wizard may later use a full-round action to cast both spells at once, resolving their effects separately. The number of sequencers a wizard may have active at once is limited, as described in the defensive sequencer ability.

\cf{Wiz}{Chain Contingency (Ex)} At 20th level, a wizard may ready a sequencer in his contingency instead of a single spell. This sequencer counts against his limit of available sequencers.

\section{Character Advancement}

As your character accomplishes challenges and defeats foes, he gains experience. If your character has enough experience, he gains a level. When you gain a level, you can increase your character's level in your current class or in any other class, and gain the benefits described for each class. Rules for taking levels in multiple classes are described in \pref{Multiclass Characters}, below.

A character that increases in level gains additional benefits. Every odd level, including 1st level, he gains a feat (see \pcref{Feats}). Every even level, he increases one of his attributes by one. He cannot increase the same attribute twice in a row. If a character has multiple classes, these benefits are gained based on the total character level, not based on class level. The experience required to reach a level, and the benefits gained at each level, are shown on \trefnp{Character Advancement}.

\section{Multiclass Characters}\label{Multiclass Characters}
A character may add new classes as he or she progresses in level, thus becoming a multiclass character. The class abilities from a character's different classes combine to determine a multiclass character's overall abilities. Multiclassing improves a character's versatility at the expense of focus.

\subsection{Class And Level Features}
As a general rule, the abilities of a multiclass character are the sum
of the abilities of each of the character's classes.

\parhead{Level} ``Character level'' is a character's total number of levels. It is used to determine when feats and attribute score boosts are gained, as noted on \tref{Character Advancement}

\par ``Class level'' is a character's level in a particular class. For a character whose levels are all in the same class, character level and class level are the same.

\parhead{Hit Points} A character gains hit points from each class as his or her class level increases, adding the new hit points to the previous total.

\parhead{Base Attack Bonus} Add your character's levels in classes that grant the same base attack bonus progressions together, then sum those base attack bonuses to find your total base attack bonus. If a character would have a higher base attack bonus by treating a level with an average base attack bonus progression as a level with a poor base attack bonus progression, he or she may do so. For example, a rogue 1 / wizard 1 would have a base attack bonus of 1.

\par For example, a 2nd-level rogue/2nd-level wizard would have a \plus2 base attack bonus. She would get a \plus1 base attack bonus from two levels in a class with average base attack bonus progression (rogue) and a \plus1 base attack bonus from two levels in a class with poor base attack bonus progression (wizard). That gives a total base attack bonus of 1 \add 1, or \plus2. In contrast, a 2nd-level rogue/2nd-level cleric would have a \plus3 base attack bonus, because she would have four levels in classes with average base attack bonus progression.

\parhead{Special Defenses} Add your character's levels in classes that grant the same base special defense bonus progressions together, then sum those base special defense bonuses to find your total base save bonus.

\par For example, a 3rd-level rogue/2nd-level ranger has a \plus5 base save bonus on Fortitude saving throws (\plus1 from 3 levels in a class with a poor Fortitude save and \plus4 from two levels in a class with a good Fortitude save), a \plus7 base save bonus on Reflex saving throws (from five levels in classes with good Reflex saves), and a \plus2 base save bonus on Will saving throws (from five levels in classes with poor Will saves).

\parhead{Skills} When taking the first level in a class, if that class gives more skill points than the most skill points the character already received from a class, the character immediately gets skill points equal to the difference. For example, if a fighter took a level in rogue, he would immediately get the difference between the rogue's 8 skill points at 1st level and the fighter's 2 skill points at first level, for a total of 6 skill points.

\par In addition, if the new class grants the character class skills associated with an ability that the character previously had no class skills from, the character gains skill points for the ability as normal.

\parhead{Class Features} A multiclass character gets all the class features
of all his or her classes but must also suffer the consequences of the
special restrictions of all his or her classes.

\par In some cases, two classes can have virtually identical abilities.
Use the following guidelines to determine how abilities stack.
\begin{itemize*}
\item If two identical class features are not based on level and are not gained following a specific pattern, they do not stack.
\item If two identical class features are not explicitly based on level, but both classes gain them in a predictable pattern, the levels of the two classes stack for determining when the next improvement to the class feature will be gained.
\item If two identical class features are explicitly based on level, the levels of the two classes stack for determining the power of the ability.
\item If two identical class features say how they stack, those rules trump any other rules.
\end{itemize*}
These are some examples of how to use these guidelines.
\begin{itemize*}
\item Both a druid and a ranger gain woodland stride. A druid/ranger who has woodland stride from both classes has the same woodland stride ability as a druid or ranger would.
\item Both a barbarian and a rogue get danger sense. A barbarian/rogue adds his barbarian and rogue levels together to determine his bonus from danger sense.
\item Both a barbarian and a rogue get uncanny dodge. If a barbarian/rogue would gain uncanny dodge from both classes, she instead gains improved uncanny dodge, because uncanny dodge explicitly states how it stacks.
\end{itemize*}

\parhead{Weapon and Armor Proficiency} A character uses only the highest number of weapon proficiencies granted by her classes. If a class grants proficiency with specific weapon groups, that is counted as a chosen weapon group for the purpose of the number of weapon proficiencies the character may choose. For example, a fighter/paladin would have three weapon groups of her choice, plus the weapon group of her favored deity.

However, if a class grants proficiency with a specific weapon, it is not counted against the number of weapon groups the character gains from that class. For example, a rogue/fighter gains proficiency with four weapon groups of his choice, and is additionally proficient with saps.

\subsection{Spellcasters and Multiclassing}\label{Spellcasters and Multiclassing}
The character gains spells from all of his or her spellcasting classes separately and tracks his spells per day, spells known, and caster level separately with each class.

Characters with magical ability gain a special benefit when multiclassing. Such a character must choose a specific spellcasting class he has. For every two levels that a character has in nonmagical classes, up to the number of levels he has in his chosen spellcasting class, he increases his spellcasting ability with that class. This increases his spells per day, spells known, and caster level as if he had gained a level in his chosen spellcasting class. No class features or other abilities can be gained in this way. 

For example, Gish, a 2nd level fighter / 2th level wizard, would would have the spells per day, spells known, and caster level of a 3rd level wizard. If he gained two more fighter levels, his spellcasting ability would not increase.
