# Combat Summary
This is a Gemini-generated summary of the Rise combat rules defined in `comprehensive_codex/Combat.tex`.

**Combat Flow & Core Mechanics:**
*   **Attack Resolution:** Attacks proceed through a sequence of outcomes: Glancing Blow (1-2 below defense, half damage), Miss (below defense, no effect), Critical Hit (10+ above defense, double damage, effects can repeat), and Regular Hit. Exploding d10s add to attack rolls.
*   **Damage Calculation:** Weapon damage is influenced by Power (Mundane/Magical). Extra damage behaves like inherent damage (halved on glance, doubled on crit) and applies once per attack roll per creature, excluding poisons.
*   **Taking Damage:** Damage first reduces Damage Resistance (DR), then Hit Points (HP). Vital Wounds are incurred when HP drops below 0, with specific detrimental effects determined by a Vital Roll. Negative HP is temporary, resetting to 0 at round end. Environmental damage reduces DR without consuming it, while Subdual damage increases fatigue instead of inflicting vital wounds.

**Time & Actions:**
*   Combat occurs in Rounds (~6 seconds), divided into a Movement Phase and an Action Phase. Free actions can be taken at any time.
*   Actions within an allied group resolve sequentially, while actions between different allied groups resolve simultaneously. Swift abilities resolve globally before non-Swift abilities.
*   Conflicting actions are resolved via Initiative checks, with a strict "Only One Movement Per Phase" rule.

**Movement & Positioning:**
*   Movement is governed by Move Actions and Movement Speed, which resets each phase. Various Movement Modes (Walking, Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, Gliding, Swimming) exist, each with associated Speed Categories (Fast, Average, Slow).
*   Jumping distances are determined by Strength and the Jump skill.
*   Movement is measured in 5-foot increments, with specific rules for diagonals.
*   Impediments include Difficult Terrain, Obstacles, and Undergrowth (Light/Heavy).
*   Squeezing rules apply for tight spaces or shared spaces.
*   Forced Movement comes in two types: Push (constant force, ends at obstacles, allows reactive Climb checks) and Knockback (single impact, damages on collision, no support needed).
*   Aerial Movement has specific rules regarding carrying capacity, encumbrance, midair penalties, falling, and height limits.

**Specific Attack Types:**
*   **Strikes:** The most common attack (Melee, Projectile, Thrown), with accuracy from the weapon and damage from weapon damage.
*   **Dual Strikes:** Allow attacking with two weapons simultaneously, combining stats and applying specific weapon tag rules.
*   **Split Strikes:** A dual strike variant that deals half damage but targets an additional creature.

**Universal Abilities & Conditions:**
*   There are Universal Combat Abilities like Charge, Grapple, Shove, Sprint, and Recover, which can be used by all characters regardless of their class.
*   Vision and Light rules define illumination levels (Bright, Shadowy, Brilliant, Total Darkness), affecting visibility and miss chances against unseen/concealed foes.
*   Obstacles and Cover rules detail Line of Sight (LOS) and Line of Effect (LOE), and how cover provides defense bonuses.
*   Awareness and Surprise mechanics differentiate between Aware, Unaware, and Partially Unaware states, impacting defense and combat initiation.
*   Special Combat Rules cover Fighting in Water, Mounted Combat, and the definitions of Allies, Enemies, and Neutral Parties.

**Ability Usage & Properties:**
*   Abilities are either Magical (Willpower-based Power) or Mundane (Strength-based Power).
*   Abilities have defined Ranges and often require LOS/LOE.
*   Usage Components (Verbal, Somatic) are necessary for some abilities.
*   "Functioning Like Other Abilities" means inheriting effects and bonuses but not rank upgrades.
*   Rules for Touch Range, Noticing Abilities, and various Ability Targeting scenarios (Primary/Secondary, Invalid, Unknown Locations, Targeting Proxies).
*   Understanding of Area Shapes (Cone, Cylinder, Line, Sphere, Wall) and Area Types (Burst, Emanation, Zone).
*   Impossible Abilities simply fail.
*   Ability Durations include Attuned (single/deep/targeted attunement points), Conditions (last until removed), Sustained (action to sustain, can be attuned), and Permanent.
*   Rules for Combining Effects (conflicting effects, precedence) and Suppressing Abilities.
*   Ability Tags provide descriptive information.
*   Dismissal allows ending lingering effects, primarily for magical abilities.
*   Rank Upgrades are optional power increases based on character rank or level.
