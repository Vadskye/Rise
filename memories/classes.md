# Classes

This is a summary of the Rise class rules.

* Classes are generally described in `comprehensive_codex/Classes.tex`.
* Rules for specific class abilities are found in `rust/src/classes/archetype_rank_abilities/` and `rust/src/classes/class.rs`.
* Characters in Rise have a species and a class. Most characters have a single class. Each class contains five archetypes, but each individual character chooses only three of those five archetypes.
  * Less commonly, multiclass characters can have multiple classes. They still choose a single base class, and they have any three archetypes from among the archetypes offered by their classes.
* The cleric, druid, paladin, sorcerer, votive, and wizard classes have access to spellcasting.
* The barbarian, fighter, monk, ranger, rogue, and votive classes have access to special martial abilities called maneuvers. Maneuvers are grouped into thematically related "combat styles" like "brute force" or "herald of war". Most martial characters only have access to one or two combat styles, though they may know several maneuvers from those combat styles.
