y\chapter{Races}

Each character has a race.

\section{Racial Traits}

\subsection{Racial Bonus Feats}
Each race grants a bonus feat at 1st level. Most races can only choose from a small group of feats, listed in the description of the race. A character must meet any prerequisites for these bonus feats, as normal.

\subsection{Favored Weapons}
The names of some exotic weapons, such as the orcish double axe, include the name of a race.
Members of the eponymous race can treat those weapons as if they were martial weapons
rather than exotic weapons.

\subsection{Race and Languages}
All characters know how to speak Common. A dwarf, elf, gnome, half-elf, half-orc, or halfling also speaks a racial language, as appropriate. A character who has an Intelligence bonus at 1st level speaks other languages as well, one extra language per point of Intelligence bonus as a starting character.

\parhead{Literacy} Any character except a barbarian can read and write all the languages he or she speaks.

\parhead{Class-Related Languages} Clerics, druids, and wizards can choose certain languages as bonus languages even if they're not on the lists found in the race descriptions. These class-related languages are as follows:
\subparhead{Cleric} Abyssal, Celestial, Infernal.
\subparhead{Druid} Sylvan.
\subparhead{Wizard} Draconic.

\subsection{Small Characters}
A Small character gets a \plus1 size bonus to Armor Class, a \plus1 size bonus on attack rolls, a \plus4 size bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks. A Small character's carrying capacity is three-quarters of that of a Medium character.

A Small character generally moves about two-thirds as fast as a Medium character.

A Small character must use smaller weapons than a Medium character.
