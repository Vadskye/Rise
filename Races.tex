\chapter{Races and Backgrounds}

Each character has a race.

\section{Racial Traits}

\subsection{Racial Bonus Feats}
Each race grants a bonus feat at 1st level. Most races can only choose from a small group of feats, listed in the description of the race. A character must meet any prerequisites for these bonus feats, as normal.

\subsection{Favored Weapons}
The names of some exotic weapons, such as the orcish double axe, include the name of a race. Members of the named race can treat those weapons as if they were martial weapons rather than exotic weapons.

\subsection{Race and Languages}
All characters know how to speak Common. A dwarf, elf, gnome, half-elf, half-orc, or halfling also speaks a racial language, as appropriate. For each point of Intelligence a character has at 1st level, they also know one additional language.

\parhead{Literacy} Any character can read and write all the languages he or she speaks.

\parhead{Class-Related Languages} Clerics, druids, and wizards can choose certain languages as bonus languages even if they're not on the lists found in the race descriptions. These class-related languages are as follows:
\subparhead{Cleric} Abyssal, Celestial, Infernal.
\subparhead{Druid} Sylvan.
\subparhead{Wizard} Draconic.

\subsection{Small Characters}\label{Small Characters}
A Small character has the following effects based on their size.
  \begin{itemize} 
    \item \minus4 penalty to maneuver attack and defense.
    \item \plus1 bonus to other physical attacks and defenses.
    \item \plus4 bonus to Stealth checks.
    \item Carrying capacity is three-quarters that of a Medium character (see \pcref{Encumbrance}).
  \end{itemize}

In addition, a Small character generally moves about two-thirds as fast as a Medium character. A Small character must also use smaller weapons than a Medium character.

\section{Backgrounds}
In addition to a race, each character also has at least one background. A background describes what a character has done before the start of the story. Suggested backgrounds are given below, but you can also create new backgrounds. You can choose anything your character might reasonably have done as a background. You can also choose to have multiple backgrounds if your character has done a variety of things.

Regardless of how you choose your background or backgrounds, choose any two skills related to what your character has done. You gain a \plus1 bonus to those skills.
