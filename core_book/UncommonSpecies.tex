\section{Animal Hybrid}
    Animal hybrids are humanoid creatures that are a combination of humans and animals.
    The abilities of an animal hybrid depend on the type of animal it is based on.

    \parhead{Size} Medium.
    \parhead{Attributes} The attributes of an awakened animal depend on its size.
    \parhead{Special Abilities} As the original animal.
    \parhead{Automatic Languages} Common and any one \glossterm{common language} (see \tref{Common Languages}).

    \subsection{Sample Animal Hybrids}

        \parhead{Hybrid Bee}

        \subparhead{Special Abilities}
        \parhead{Attribute} \plus1 Dexterity, \minus1 Constitution.
        \begin{itemize}
            \itemhead{Low-light Vision} A hybrid bee has \trait{low-light vision}, allowing it to see clearly in \glossterm{shadowy illumination} (see \pcref{Low-light Vision}).
            \itemhead{Stinger} A hybrid bee has a stinger natural weapon (see \pcref{Natural Weapons}).
                Whenever it causes a creature to lose \glossterm{hit points} with that natural weapon, the struck creature is poisoned by giant wasp venom (see \pcref{Poison}).
                Its stage 1 effect makes the target \slowed while the poison lasts.
                Its stage 3 effect makes the target \immobilized while the poison lasts.
            \itemhead{Winged Agility} A hybrid bee has wings that are not strong enough to help it fly.
                However, the wings still help it stabilize its movements.
                It gains a \plus3 bonus to the Balance and Jump skills, and it gains a \plus5 foot bonus to its maximum horizontal jump distance (see \pcref{Jumping}).
                This increases its maximum vertical jump distance normally.
        \end{itemize}

        \parhead{Hybrid Shark}

        \subparhead{Special Abilities}
        \begin{itemize}
            \itemhead{Bloodscent} A hybrid shark has the scent ability (see \pcref{Scent}).
                In addition, it gains a \plus10 bonus to Awareness checks to detect blood.
            \itemhead{Bite} A hybrid shark's mouth is elongated, which it can use as a bite attack (see \pcref{Natural Weapons}).
                A hybrid shark's bite deals 1d6 damage.
            \itemhead{Gills} You can breathe water as easily as a human breathes air, preventing you from drowning or suffocating underwater.
            \itemhead{Swim Speed} A hybrid shark has a swim speed equal to the base speed for its size.
        \end{itemize}

        \begin{itemize}
            \itemhead{Scent} A hybrid wolf has the scent ability (see \pcref{Scent}).
            \itemhead{Bite} A hybrid wolf's mouth is elongated, which it can use as a bite attack (see \pcref{Natural Weapons}).

            \itemhead{Low-light Vision} A hybrid wolf has \trait{low-light vision}, allowing it to see clearly in \glossterm{shadowy illumination} (see \pcref{Low-light Vision}).
        \end{itemize}

\section{Automaton}
    An automaton appears to be a humanoid construct, like a golem.
    Its body is made from some combination of stone, wood, and metal.
    However, its artificial body is inhabited by a true soul, making it an indwelt (see \pcref{Indwelt}).

    \parhead{Size} Medium.
    \parhead{Attributes} \plus1 Constitution or Intelligence, \minus1 Dexterity.
    \parhead{Special Abilities}
    \begin{itemize}
        \itemhead{Artificial Life} Automatons are not alive. They ignore abilities which only affect living creatures, including poisons and most healing abilities. In addition, they do not need to eat, drink, or sleep.
        \itemhead{Automaton Archetype} Automatons only gain two class archetypes instead of three.
            Instead, they treat the Automaton archetype as one of their archetypes, and they gain ranks in it just like they gain ranks in class archetypes.
        \itemhead{Manual Repair} A Craft skill relevant to the automaton's body can be used to achieve the same effects that the Medicine skill would have on a living creature.
        \itemhead{Mechanical Body} Automatons are considered both objects and creatures, and are affected by abilities which affect either.
            They are always considered to be \glossterm{attended} by themselves, so they are never affected by abilities that only affect unattended objects, even while unconscious.
        \itemhead{Mechanical Intuition} Automatons gain a \plus2 bonus to the Devices skill and one Craft skill of their choice.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Automaton Archetype}

        \cf{Aut}[1]{Modular Carapace} You can adjust the density and layering of your hardened exterior to augment your defenses.
        Changing your configuration in this way requires 10 minutes of work, and spare armor parts that you generally keep with you.
        You can choose to treat your carapace as being light, medium, or heavy armor.
        The benefits from this ability are considered to come from body armor, and do not stack with actual body armor.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Light armor: You gain a \plus3 bonus to your Armor defense, and a damage resistance bonus equal to three times your rank in this archetype.
                You can wear body armor on top of this carapace.
                Although the benefits of that armor do not stack with the carapace, you can use the higher Armor defense value and damage resistance bonus from either armor.
            \item Medium armor: You gain a \plus4 bonus to your Armor defense, a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{vital rolls}, and a damage resistance bonus equal to four times your rank in this archetype.
                However, your Dexterity bonus to your Armor defense is halved, and you cannot wear body armor.
            \item Heavy armor: You gain a \plus5 bonus to your Armor defense, a \plus2 bonus to \glossterm{vital rolls}, and a damage resistance bonus equal to five times your rank in this archetype.
                However, your Dexterity bonus to your Armor defense is removed, you take a \minus10 foot penalty to your speed with all movement modes, and you cannot wear body armor.
        \end{itemize}

        If you lose your original armor parts, you can create or buy new parts that are suited to your body.
        These parts are considered a Rank 1 (40 gp) item.

        \cf{Aut}[2]{Modular Weaponry} You can customize your arms to augment your combat prowess.
        Changing your configuration in this way requires 10 minutes of work, and spare arm and weapon parts that you generally keep with you.
        \begin{itemize}
            % Two improvements over baseline
            \item Blade: You convert one of your arms into a blade natural weapon.
                It has a \plus1 accuracy bonus, deals 1d8 slashing damage, and has the \weapontag{Keen} and \weapontag{Sweeping} (1) weapon tags (see \pcref{Weapon Tags}).
                However, that arm no longer has a \glossterm{free hand}.
            % Two improvements over baseline
            \item Bulk: You convert one of your arms into a bulky, overburdened slam natural weapon.
                It deals 1d10 bludgeoning damage and has the \weapontag{Impact} and \weapontag{Resonating} weapon tags.
                However, that arm no longer has a \glossterm{free hand}.
            \item Fortified: You add additional protective plating to your arms.
                You gain a \plus1 bonus to your Armor defense.
                This does not require a \glossterm{free hand}, but it is still considered to come from a shield, and it does not stack with the benefit from using a shield.
            \item Slim: You trim away the excess protection from your arms to make their movements more precise.
                You gain a \plus1 accuracy bonus with any attack that uses your hands, including \glossterm{strikes} and abilities like \ability{grapple}.
                This does not apply to spells that simply have \glossterm{somatic components}, though it does apply to touch spells like \spell{freezing grasp}.
                However, you take a \minus1 penalty to your Armor defense.
        \end{itemize}

        If you lose your original arm and weapon parts, you can create or buy new parts that are suited to your body.
        These parts are considered a Rank 1 (40 gp) item.

        \magicalcf{Aut}[3]{Imbued Carapace} When you gain this ability, choose one magic body armor property for each of your three \ability{modular carapace} types (see \tref{Magic Armor}).
        The property must be rank 3 or lower.
        Whenever you use a carapace type, you can gain the benefit of its magic armor property, though you must still \glossterm{attune} to the property.
        Each carapace can have a unique property, or you can choose the same property for multiple carapace types.
        If you are using a light carapace, you can gain the benefit of its magic armor property in addition to any magic armor you wear on top of the carapace.

        Whenever you gain a rank in this archetype, you can choose a new property for each of your carapace types.
        Each property's rank must be no higher than your rank in this archetype.
        Magic armor of rank 3 or higher does not multiply the damage resistance provided by your carapace, as magic armor normally does (see \pcref{Magic Armor Damage Resistance}).

        \magicalcf{Aut}[4]{Embedded Armory} Whenever you use your \ability{modular weaponry} ability to change your configuration, you can also embed one magic weapon, implement, glove, gauntlet, or bracer into one of your arms.
        You can attune to that item without having it physically present on your arm.
        If you attune to a weapon embedded this way, you apply its magical properties to any nonmagical weapons you use with that arm, including natural weapons and weapons made from special materials.
        You cannot embed a \glossterm{legacy item} in this way.

        \cf{Aut}[5]{Modular Carapace+} The damage resistance from your \textit{modular carapace} armor increases.
        Light carapace increases to four times your rank in this archetype, medium carapace increases to five times your rank, and heavy carapace increases to seven times your rank.

        \cf{Aut}[5]{Reassembly} You can recover from vital wounds more easily by simply replacing broken parts.
        You can remove a vital wound with ten minutes of work.
        This increases your \glossterm{fatigue level} by three, and it requires replacement parts that you generally keep with you.
        The parts are considered a consumable Rank 3 (200 gp) item.

        This can even save you from death, though that is more difficult and requires more advanced parts.
        A creature can spend eight hours replacing broken parts of your corpse to \glossterm{resurrect} you (see \pcref{Resurrection}).
        % Baseline trained bonus at rank 5 is +9.
        This requires a \glossterm{difficulty value} 15 Craft check appropriate to the composition of your body.
        The parts required to perform this feat are considered a consumable Rank 5 (5,000 gp) item.

        \cf{Aut}[6]{Artificial Mind} You become immune to \abilitytag{Compulsion} and \abilitytag{Emotion} attacks.

        \cf{Aut}[7]{Hypercognition} You can take an additional \glossterm{minor action} each round, as long as that minor action is purely mental.
        As normal, you cannot use the same ability twice in the same round.

        Alternately, you can take an additional purely mental standard action instead of a minor action.
        When you do, you increase your \glossterm{fatigue level} by one and you \glossterm{briefly} cannot take any additional actions with this ability.

    \subsection{Base Class Effects}
        If you choose automaton as your base class, you gain the following benefits.

        \cf{Aut}{Defenses}

\section{Drow}

    Drow are an offshoot group of elves that live deep underground.
    The deep caves are a far harsher environment than the surface world.
    Resources are scarce, and dangerous monsters are far more common.
    In order to survive, drow were forced to adopt a variety of practices condemned by surface civilizations.
    The most notorious are their frequent use of poison, their refusal to take prisoners, their willingness to eat any non-drow creatures they kill, even sentient creatures.
    In addition, drow society tends to reward selfishness and ambition more explicitly than surface civilizations, and the vast majority of drow are evil.

    When drow find opportunities to reach the surface world, they seek to conquer territory for themselves, usually with great violence.
    They have always been defeated and banished back to their caves, but surface civilizations still remember the danger that drow pose.
    Even more so than tieflings or orcs, who are already viewed with suspicion, drow are anathema in almost any civilized society.
    Drow who escape the deep caves are more likely to find a peaceful existence on other planes that do not fear an underground invasion.

                Any object or effect which blocks light also blocks this ability's effect.
            \end{magicalsustainability}
        \itemhead{Drow Prejudice} Almost all surface-dwellers have negative associations with drow.
            Drow have an Opposition relationship with most people that they meet, which influences people's behavior and makes Persuasion checks harder (see \pcref{Persuasion}).
            People in some locations, such as deep underground, do not have this attitude.
        \itemhead{Keen Senses} Drow gain a \plus2 bonus to the Awareness skill (see \pcref{Awareness}).
        \itemhead{Poison Tolerance} Drow are \trait{impervious} to poison.

            Instead of sleeping, drow can trance for 4 hours.
            An elf in trance may make Perception-based checks at a \minus5 penalty.
            Drow must still avoid strenuous activity for 8 hours to heal and gain other benefits of taking a \glossterm{long rest}.

\section{Dryaidi}

    Dryaidi are humanoid creatures with plantlike characteristics.
    They might have leaves instead of hair, a green skin tone, or rough, barky skin.
    They are descended from dryads, and share some fey heritage and an affinity for trees.

    \parhead{Size} Medium.
    \parhead{Attributes} No change.
    \parhead{Special Abilities}
    \begin{itemize}
        \itemhead{Dryad Archetype} Dryaidi only gain two class archetypes instead of three.
            Instead, they treat the Dryad archetype as one of their archetypes, and they gain ranks in it just like they gain ranks in class archetypes.
        \itemhead{Enchanting Appearance} A dryaidi gains a \plus2 bonus to the Creature Handling, Perform, and Persuasion skills.
        \itemhead{Fey Vulnerability} Dryaidi are \vulnerable to cold iron weapons.
        \itemhead{Tree Bond} A dryaidi must be bonded with a specific tree.
        The tree must be at least a hundred years old, healthy, and intact.
        Forming a bond or severing a bond takes one week of meditation and ritual, periodically interrupted by rest.
        Forming a bond also requires asking permission from the tree through the ritual.
        Any individual tree can only be bonded to one dryad or dryaidi in this way.

        As long as the bonded tree remains healthy and intact, the dryaidi gains a \plus1 bonus to Mental defense and a \plus1 bonus to its \glossterm{fatigue tolerance}.
        If the bonded tree becomes unhealthy, is seriously damaged, or is killed, these bonuses are inverted into penalties until the dryaidi forms a bond with a new tree.
        A bonded dryaidi can passively observe the general health and status of the tree it bonded to.
        \itemhead{Verdant Flourishing} Dryaidi can use the \spell{fertile patch} and \spell{rapid growth} \glossterm{cantrips} from the \sphere{verdamancy} sphere.
        If they already have access to that sphere, they can cast each of those cantrips as a \glossterm{minor action}.
    \end{itemize}
    \parhead{Automatic Languages} Common, Sylvan.

    \subsection{Dryad Archetype}

        \cf{Dry}[1]{Tree Stride} You can walk into and through living trees.
        Moving through a tree does not impede your movement in any way, and you can end your movement inside a tree.
        When you do, you can choose to be partially melded or fully melded with the tree.
        While partially melded, the tree provides \glossterm{cover} against all attacks against you.
        While fully melded, the tree blocks \glossterm{line of sight} or \glossterm{line of effect} between you and the outside world as long as it remains intact.

        At the end of each round, if you are fully or partially melded with a tree that you are bonded with using your \textit{tree bond} ability, you regain hit points equal to half your maximum hit points.

        \cf{Dry}[2]{Natural Speech} You can speak with plants and animals as if they were capable of ordinary speech.
            This ability does not make them any more friendly or cooperative than normal.
            Wary and cunning animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while stupid ones tend to make inane comments and are unlikely to say or understand anything of use.
            Plants do not have complex thought processes, but can provide information about events that have happened near them.
            In general, plants can remember events that happened within the most recent quarter of their lifespan.

        \cf{Dry}[3]{Tree Stride+} You can \glossterm{teleport} between living trees instead of moving using your \glossterm{land speed}.
        Teleporting a given distance costs movement equal to half that distance.
        If this teleportation fails for any reason, you still expend that movement.

        \cf{Dry}[4]{Fey Charm}
        \begin{magicalsustainability}{Fey Charm}{\abilitytag{Emotion}, \abilitytag{Subtle}, \abilitytag{Sustain} (minor)}
            \abilityusagetime \glossterm{Minor action}.
            \rankline
            Make an attack vs. Mental against a creature within \medrange that is an animal, plant, or humanoid.
            You take a \minus10 penalty to \glossterm{accuracy} with this attack against creatures who have made an attack or been attacked since the start of the last round.
            \hit The target is \charmed by you.
            Any act by you or by creatures that appear to be your allies that threatens or harms the charmed person breaks the effect.
            Harming the target is not limited to dealing it damage, but also includes causing it significant subjective discomfort.
            An observant target may interpret overt threats to its allies as a threat to itself.

            \rankline

            \noindent The attack's \glossterm{accuracy} increases by \plus2 for each rank beyond 4.
        \end{magicalsustainability}

        \cf{Dry}[5]{Tree Bond+} You can bond to a grove of trees instead of a single tree.
        The cumulative age of all trees in the grove must be at least a thousand years, and the grove must fit within a 500 foot radius.
        While bonded to a grove, the bonuses from your \textit{tree bond} and \textit{enchanting appearance} abilities double.

        \cf{Dry}[6]{Tree Union} When you meld with a tree using your \textit{tree stride} ability, you can fully unite with it.
        When you do, you have \glossterm{line of sight} and \glossterm{line of effect} from all areas of the tree simultaneously, as if you were everywhere in the tree's body.
        Attacks against the tree simultaneously affect both you and the tree, but both you and the tree are \impervious to all damage except for fire damage and damage from cold iron weapons.
        You and the tree are instead \vulnerable to fire damage and damage from cold iron weapons.

        \cf{Dry}[7]{Acorns of Life} Whenever you visit a tree you are bonded to with your \textit{tree bond} ability, you can gather acorns of life.
        You can have up to ten acorns of life at once.
        As a \glossterm{minor action}, you can throw an acorn of life onto an unoccupied \glossterm{grounded} space within \medrange of you.
        The space must be made of dirt, earth, or stone.
        When the acorn lands, a tree immediately grows in that space.
        The tree has a five foot diameter trunk and grows vertically until it reaches a hundred feet tall or until it encounters a solid obstacle preventing its growth.

        This increases your maximum vertical jump distance normally.

        \cf{Hrp}[1]{Winged Combat} As a \glossterm{free action}, you can make a short hop off of solid ground to hover in your space using your wings.
        This allows you to use both of your feet without standing on them during that phase, so you can attack with both talons at once.
        You must land at the end of the phase, and you can only use this ability once per round.

                It can otherwise act freely, and is still able to attack you and your allies.

                If you attack the target with any ability other than this one, this effect is automatically broken.
                When this effect ends, the target becomes immune to this effect until it finishes a \glossterm{short rest}.

            \item A \glossterm{fatigue tolerance} equal to 4 \add your Constitution.
                Your fatigue tolerance makes it easier for you to use powerful abilities that fatigue you (see \pcref{Fatigue}).

\section{Incarnation}

    An incarnation is a physical embodiment of an element or form of energy, like an elemental.
    Unlike elementals, incarnations are alive and have souls.
    Most incarnations are created on the plane associated with their element or energy and never leave that plane.
    However, in rare circumstances involving powerful magic, incarnations can sometimes be created in other planes.

    \parhead{Creature Type} Unlike most other playable species, incarnations are planeforged instead of humanoids.
    \parhead{Size} Medium.
    \parhead{Attributes} One attribute gains a \plus1 bonus and another takes a \minus1 penalty, depending on the chosen element or energy.
    \parhead{Special Abilities}
    \begin{itemize}
        \itemhead{Essence Affinity} Each incarnation is \impervious to a damage type and \vulnerable to a different damage type.
        For each damage type, it can choose any subtype of physical damage, any subtype of energy damage, or psychic damage.
        This choice is made independently of its choice of \textit{essence infusion}.
        \magicalitemhead{Essence Infusion} Each incarnation chooses one damage type as its essence infusion.
        It can choose any subtype of physical damage, any subtype of energy damage, or psychic damage.
        All of the incarnation's \glossterm{strikes} automatically deal damage of that type in addition to their other damage types.
        This damage type is called the incarnation's essential damage type.
        \itemhead{Glowing} If appropriate to an incarnation's essence, it may naturally shed light as a torch.
        An incarnation cannot willingly disable this light, though the light can be covered by thick clothing.
        \itemhead{Poison Resistance} An incarnation is \impervious to poisons and poison damage.
        \itemhead{Unusual Body} An incarnation's body can be unusually light or heavy compared to an ordinary creature's body.
        It can be \glossterm{lightweight} or \glossterm{heavyweight}, depending on its essence.
    \end{itemize}
    \parhead{Automatic Languages} Common.

    Incarnations can come in two forms: tethered or untethered.
    Tethered incarnations are bipedal, with two legs and two arms.
    They have the same basic body shape and functionality as a human, though they may have unusual proportions.

    Untethered incarnations have no arms or legs.
    They may appear as a perfect sphere, as intricate shifting arcane glyphs, or any other appearance depending on their nature.
    The appearance of any individual untethered incarnation is consistent.
    They are not shapeshifters or masters of disguise, simply unbound by ordinary conceptions of a ``normal'' body shape.
    An untethered incarnation has the following special abilities:
    \begin{raggeditemize}
        \itemhead{Esoteric Body} The incarnation has no arms, legs, or \glossterm{free hands}.
            This means it is unable to use manufactured weapons or \glossterm{somatic components}.
            It can wear armor, but the armor is treated as \glossterm{barding} instead of normal armor, reducing its effectiveness (see \pcref{Barding}).
            It has no land speed.
            Since it has no legs, it is immune to being \prone, but it also cannot jump.
        \magicalitemhead{Flight} The incarnation's only movement mode is a \glossterm{fly speed} equal to its base speed, with a 5 foot height limit (see \pcref{Aerial Movement}).
            Since it is native to the air, flying does not penalize its Armor or Reflex defenses.
            It is also \trait{floating}, so it does not need to fly every phase to avoid falling.
        \itemhead{Ram} The incarnation gains a ram \glossterm{natural weapon}.
            It deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage and has the \weapontag{Resonating} weapon tag (see \pcref{Weapon Tags}).
        \itemhead{Uniform Composition} The incarnation is immune to \glossterm{critical hits} from strikes.
    \end{raggeditemize}

    \cf{Inc}[2]{Essence Flare} Whenever you use the \ability{total defense} or \ability{recover} abilities, you \glossterm{briefly} become \impervious to all damage types other than your vulnerability from the \textit{essence affinity} ability.
    This effect has the \abilitytag{Swift} tag, so it affects attacks against you during the current phase.

    \cf{Inc}[3]{Deep Tether} You gain a special ability depending on whether you are tethered or untethered.
    \begin{raggeditemize}
        \item Tethered: You gain a \plus1 bonus to your \glossterm{fatigue tolerance}.
            In addition, whenever you use the \ability{sprint} ability, you leave a damaging wall in the path you traveled.
            Whenever a creature or object passes through the wall, you make an attack against its Reflex defense.
            You can only attack a given target with this ability once per \glossterm{phase}.
            On a hit, the target takes damage as if you hit it with your \ability{essence pulse} ability.
            On a miss, the target takes half damage.
        \item Untethered: The height limit of your fly speed increases to 15 feet.
            In addition, whenever you use the \ability{sprint} ability, you can become \trait{intangible} during that phase.
            This ability has the \abilitytag{Swift} tag, so it affects attacks against you during the current phase.
    \end{raggeditemize}

    \cf{Inc}[4]{Essence Exemplar} The bonus to an attribute that you gain from being an incarnate increases to \plus2.

    \cf{Inc}[5]{Essence Affinity+} You become \glossterm{immune} instead of impervious to the damage type from your \textit{essence affinity} ability.

    \cf{Inc}[5]{Essence Infusion+} You gain a \plus1 accuracy bonus with all abilities that deal damage of your essential damage type.

    \cf{Inc}[6]{Deep Tether+} You gain a special ability depending on whether you are tethered or untethered.
    \begin{raggeditemize}
        \item Tethered: The fatigue tolerance bonus increases to \plus2.
            In addition, when you use the \ability{desperate exertion} ability to affect an attack that deals damage of your essential damage type, you can use this ability.
            If you do, you only increase your fatigue level by one instead of by two.
            After using this ability, you \glossterm{briefly} cannot use it again.
        \item Untethered: You gain a \plus10 foot bonus to your fly speed.

            \item Untethered: You \glossterm{briefly} become \trait{incorporeal}.
            If this effect ends while you are inside of a solid object, you are pushed back in the direction from which you entered that object until you emerge.
            You take 5d10 bludgeoning damage for every 5 feet that you are pushed in this way.

\section{Kit}

    Kit are humanoid creatures that have noticeable foxlike characteristics.
    They are descended from natural fox spirits.
    All kit have at least one tail, and some have multiple tails.
    Their tails are distinctly fluffy and fox-like, and most kit put effort into concealing their tails to avoid revealing their true nature.

    \parhead{Size} Medium.
    \parhead{Attributes} No change.
    \parhead{Special Abilities}
    \begin{itemize}
        \itemhead{Foxlike Agility} Kit gain a \plus2 bonus to the Balance and Stealth skills.
        \itemhead{Illusory Guise \sparkle} As a standard action, a kit can magically disguise its physical appearance in minor ways.
            This functions like the \textit{change appearance} ability with a \plus4 bonus, except that a kit cannot change the appearance of its equipment, creature type, or number of limbs, including any tails it may have (see \pcref{Change Appearance}).
            This ability lasts until the kit uses it again or \glossterm{dismisses} it.
        \itemhead{Instictive Trickster} Kit gain a \plus2 bonus to the Deception and Social Insight skills.
        \itemhead{Low-light Vision} Kit have \trait{low-light vision}, allowing them to see clearly in \glossterm{shadowy illumination} (see \pcref{Low-light Vision}).
    \end{itemize}
    \parhead{Automatic Languages} Common, any one \glossterm{common language}.

\section{Naiadi}
    Naiadi are humanoid creatures descended from naiads.
    Most naiadi are unusually physically appealing, but show no other outward signs of their heritage.

    \parhead{Size} Medium.
    \parhead{Attributes} No change.
    \parhead{Special Abilities}
    \begin{itemize}
        \itemhead{Create Water} A naiadi can cast the \spell{create water} cantrip.
            When they do so, they do not require \glossterm{verbal components} or \glossterm{somatic components}, and their spellcasting rank is considered to be equal to their rank in their highest rank archetype.
            If they would already know that cantrip through the Aquamancy sphere, the volume of water created with the cantrip doubles.
        \itemhead{Enchanting Appearance} A naiadi gains a \plus2 bonus to the Creature Handling, Perform, and Persuasion skills.
        \itemhead{Low-light Vision} Naiadi have \trait{low-light vision}, allowing them to see clearly in \glossterm{shadowy illumination} (see \pcref{Low-light Vision}).
        \itemhead{Naiad Archetype} You may choose three class archetypes, as normal.
            However, you may choose the Naiad archetype in place of one of your class archetypes.
            If you do, you gain ranks in it just like you gain ranks in class archetypes.
            You cannot choose naiad as your base class.
        \itemhead{Water Affinity} A naiadi has a \glossterm{swim speed} equal to the \glossterm{base speed} for their size.
            In addition, they can breathe clean water like a human breathes air.
    \end{itemize}
    \parhead{Automatic Languages} Common, Sylvan, any one \glossterm{common language}.

    \subsection{Naiad Archetype}

        \magicalcf{Nai}[1]{Water Bond} You can form a bond with a fresh stream, lake, or other Gargantuan or larger body of fresh water (not salt water).
        Forming a bond or severing a bond takes one week of meditation and ritual, periodically interrupted by rest.
        Forming a bond also requires asking permission from the water.
        Any individual body of water can only be bonded to one naiad or naiadi in this way.

        As long as your bonded water remains clean, pure, and large enough to be a valid subject of bonding, you gain a \plus1 bonus to Mental defense and a bonus equal to twice your rank in this archetype to your \glossterm{hit points}.
        If your bonded water becomes contaminated or shrinks below the minimum size, these bonuses are inverted into penalties until you sever the bond.
        You can passively observe the general health and status of water you are bonded to, including knowing when significant pollutants enter the water and when the water grows or shrinks significantly.

        \magicalcf{Nai}[2]{Fluidseeker} You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} against creatures significantly composed of water or watery fluids.
        This is true of almost all living creatures.

        \magicalcf{Nai}[2]{Freshwater Fountain} The volume of water you can create with the \spell{create water} cantrip increases by five times.

        \magicalcf{Nai}[3]{Aqueous Form} You can cast the \spell{aqueous form} spell.
        When you do, you do not require \glossterm{verbal components} or \glossterm{somatic components}, and you use your rank in this archetype as your your spellcasting rank.
        In addition, it has the Attune tag instead of the Attune (deep) tag.

        \magicalcf{Nai}[4]{Greater Water Bond} The bonuses from your \textit{water bond} ability increase to \plus2 Mental defense and three times your rank in this archetype to your hit points.

        \magicalcf{Nai}[5]{Greater Fluidseeker} The accuracy bonus from your \textit{fluidseeker} ability increases to \plus2.

        \magicalcf{Nai}[5]{Greater Freshwater Fountain} The multiplier from your \textit{freshwater fountain} ability increases to twenty times the normal volume of water.

        \magicalcf{Nai}[6]{Greater Aqueous Form} When you cast the \spell{aqueous form} spell, it does not have the \abilitytag{Attune} tag.
        Instead, it lasts until you \glossterm{dismiss} it.

        \magicalcf{Nai}[7]{Supreme Water Bond} The bonuses from your \textit{water bond} ability increase to \plus3 Mental defense and three times your rank in this archetype to your hit points.

\section{Oozeborn}
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{optional rules/oozeborn}
    Oozeborn are ooze creatures that have gained true sentience through a strange quirk of their birth.
    They are very rare to see in civilized lands, as most oozeborn lack the opportunity to discover more than the dark caves in which they were spawned.
    Since they often grow up without mentorship from any civilized creature, oozeborn tend to have odd mannerisms and a poor ability to mask their emotions, even after spending years in civilization.
    Old oozeborn may eventually adapt to societal norms and act perfectly natural, or they may abandon civilized company entirely.

    The body of an oozeborn is amorphous, and they lack any identifiable internal organs.
    Their natural color depends on the nature of the ooze that spawned them, so green and gray are the most common colors.
    Adventuring oozeborn typically assume a bipedal shape for both practical and social convenience, but their natural shape is a loosely spherical blob.
    Unconscious oozeborn revert to their default state automatically, though some learn to maintain a semblance of cohesion while asleep.

    \parhead{Creature Type} Unlike most other playable species, oozeborn are animates instead of humanoids.
    \parhead{Size} Medium.
    \parhead{Attributes} \minus1 Intelligence, \plus1 Constitution.
    \parhead{Special Abilities}
    \begin{itemize}
        \itemhead{Acidic Body} Ooozeborn are \trait{impervious} to acid damage and poisons.
        \itemhead{Amorphous Form} An oozeborn's natural form is a loosely spherical blob.
            They have a \minus10 foot penalty to their \glossterm{land speed}, but they gain a \plus5 bonus to the Flexibility skill (see \pcref{Flexibility}).
            Since they have no legs, they are immune to being \prone.
            Most legless creatures cannot jump, but oozeborn can jump without penalty.
            They can also use the \ability{mold body} ability to adopt a particular shape.
            \begin{sustainability}{Mold Body}{\abilitytag{Sustain} (free)}
                \abilityusagetime Standard action.
                \rankline
                You make a Disguise check to alter your appearance (see \pcref{Change Appearance}).
                This physically changes your body to match the results of your disguise.
                You gain a \plus4 bonus on the check, and you ignore penalties for changing your gender, species, subtype, age, and number of limbs.
                However, this effect is unable to alter your equipment in any way.

                You cannot create more than four limbs with this ability, and a maximum of two \glossterm{free hands}.
                If you add at least two legs, you gain a \plus10 foot bonus to your land speed.
                % TODO: awkwardly worded
                This speed bonus does not stack with the bonus for becoming \trait{multipedal}, so the only benefit you gain from creating three or more legs is a \plus5 bonus to the Balance skill.
                If you give yourself a standard humanoid shape, you can wear armor designed for humanoids without suffering the normal penalties for \glossterm{barding} (see \pcref{Barding}).

                You can sustain this ability for any length of time without mental strain, ignoring the normal 5 minute limit.
            \end{sustainability}
        \itemhead{Compressible Body} Oozeborn can compress their head and shoulders down to a minimum of a one inch radius, allowing them to squeeze through very small areas.
            Their clothing or armor is not compressed, so they may limit their ability to move through extremely narrow spaces.
        \itemhead{Darkvision} Oozeborn have \trait{darkvision} with a 60 foot range, allowing them to see in complete darkness (see \pcref{Darkvision}).
        \itemhead{Oozeborn Archetype} Oozeborn only gain two class archetypes instead of three.
            Instead, they treat the Oozeborn archetype as one of their archetypes, and they gain ranks in it just like they gain ranks in class archetypes.
    \end{itemize}
    \parhead{Automatic Languages} Common.
    
    \subsection{Oozeborn Archetype}

        \cf{Ooz}[1]{Acidic Pseudopod} One of your arms becomes a pseudopod \glossterm{natural weapon}.
        It deals 1d10 bludgeoning and acid damage and has the \weapontag{Long} weapon tag (see \pcref{Weapon Tags}).
        You do not have a \glossterm{free hand} on that arm while using it as a weapon in this way.

        In addition, all damage you deal with natural weapons is acid damage in addition to its other types.
        This does not affect damage you deal with manufactured weapons.

        \cf{Ooz}[2]{Darkborn Senses} You gain \trait{blindsense} with a 60 foot range, allowing you to sense your surroundings without light (see \pcref{Blindsense}).
        If you already have the blindsense ability, you increase its range by 60 feet.
        In addition, you gain \trait{blindsight} with a 15 foot range, allowing you to see without light (see \pcref{Blindsight}).
        If you already have the blindsight ability, you increase its range by 15 feet.

        \cf{Ooz}[2]{Ingest Object} You can use the \textit{ingest object} ability as a standard action.
        This functions like the \spell{absorb object} spell, except that the maximum size of the object is equal to your size.
        Anything you absorb in this way takes a single point of \glossterm{environmental} acid damage during each of your actions while it remains absorbed.
        This damage is insufficient to hurt most objects made from wood, stone, or metal, but it can destroy more fragile objects like paper or complex mechanical traps.

        \cf{Ooz}[3]{Amorphous Form+} You gain a \plus4 bonus to your defenses when determining whether a \glossterm{strike} gets a \glossterm{critical hit} against you instead of a normal hit.
        In addition, your \ability{mold body} ability loses the \abilitytag{Sustain} (free) tag.
        Instead, it lasts until you choose to \glossterm{dismiss} it.
        This allows you to maintain your shape while unconscious.

        \cf{Ooz}[3]{Compressible Body+} You reduce your penalties for \squeezing by 1.

        \cf{Ooz}[4]{Acidic Body+} You are \trait{immune} to acid damage and poisons.

        \cf{Ooz}[5]{Darkborn Senses+} The range of your \trait{blindsense} increases by 60 feet.
        In addition, the range of your \trait{blindsight} increases by 15 feet.

        \cf{Ooz}[5]{Ingest Object+} The maximum number of objects you can absorb with your \textit{ingest object} ability increases to 2.
        In addition, you may absorb \glossterm{allies} with that ability in addition to unattended objects.

        \cf{Ooz}[6]{Amorphous Form++} The defense bonus against critical hits from strikes increases to \plus10.

        \cf{Ooz}[6]{Compressible Body++} The reduction of squeezing penalties increases to 2.
        This means you take no penalties for squeezing unless you use the \ability{tight squeeze} ability (see \pcref{Flexibility}).

        \cf{Ooz}[7]{Third Arm} When you use your \ability{mold body} ability, you can create three arms instead of two.
        You can use all three hands as free hands.
        For example, this can allow you to use a \weapontag{Heavy} weapon and a shield simultaneously.

        In addition, your arms become stronger and more agile.
        You can use any of your arms as a pseudopod natural weapon, and your pseudopods gain the \weapontag{Light} weapon tag (see \pcref{Weapon Tags}).

    \subsection{Base Class Effects}
        If you choose oozeborn as your base class, you gain the following benefits.

        \cf{Ooz}{Defenses}

\section{Sapling}

    Saplings are young treants that have left their forest home in search of adventure.
    They tend to be slow to think and act, but resilient once they have made up their mind.

    \parhead{Creature Type} Unlike most other playable species, saplings are considered animates instead of humanoids.
    \parhead{Size} Medium.
    \parhead{Attributes} \plus1 Constitution, \plus1 Willpower, \minus1 Dexterity, \minus1 Intelligence
    \parhead{Special Abilities}
    \begin{itemize}
        \itemhead{Barkskin} A sapling gains a \plus2 bonus to Armor defense.
        \itemhead{Ingrain} A sapling can bury its roots into the ground.
            \begin{activeability}{Ingrain}
                \abilityusagetime \glossterm{Minor action}.
                \rankline
                This ability can only be used if the sapling is \glossterm{grounded}.
                The sapling's land speed becomes 5 feet, regardless of any modifiers that normally apply.
                It cannot voluntarily stop being \glossterm{grounded} while this ability lasts.
                It gains a \plus4 bonus to Fortitude defense and a \plus2 bonus to Armor defense.

                If the sapling finishes a \glossterm{long rest} with this ability active for the duration of the rest, it acquires nutrients sufficient to replace a day's worth of food and water.
                This ability lasts until the sapling ends it as a standard action, or until it stops being \glossterm{grounded}.
            \end{activeability}
        \itemhead{Limited Equipment} Saplings can wear armor, but it is treated as \glossterm{barding} instead of normal armor, reducing its effectiveness (see \pcref{Barding}).
        \itemhead{Made of Wood} Saplings are \vulnerable to fire damage. In addition, they are both creatures and plants.
        \itemhead{Treant Archetype} Saplings only gain two class archetypes instead of three.
            Instead, they treat the Treant archetype as one of their archetypes, and they gain ranks in it just like they gain ranks in class archetypes.
        \itemhead{Tree Appearance} When a sapling stays perfectly still, observers must make a DV 15 Awareness check to recognize that it is not an ordinary tree.
        Careful observers may still notice that the ordinary tree has appeared where no tree used to be, so they may be suspicious of a sapling even if they do not pass this check.
        \itemhead{Unhurried and Unfaltering} Saplings have a \minus10 penalty to speed with all \glossterm{movement modes}.
            However, saplings ignore all penalties to their land speed, such as from wearing heavy armor.
            Those penalties still apply to any other movement modes normally.
            This also does not change effects that completely replace the sapling's land speed, such as the \ability{ingrain} ability.
            In addition, saplings ignore \glossterm{difficult terrain} from inanimate natural sources, such as \glossterm{heavy undergrowth}.
    \end{itemize}
    \parhead{Automatic Languages} Common, Sylvan.

        % * R7, 21 HP - 26% (80)

        % This intentionally can bring you above half max
        \cf{Tre}[1]{Nourishing Ingrain} At the end of each round while you are \ability{ingrained}, you regain hit points equal to twice your rank in this archetype, and you may choose to remove a \glossterm{condition}.
        If you do, you increase your \glossterm{fatigue level} by one.

        \cf{Tre}[2]{Sturdy as the Mighty Oak} You gain a bonus equal to three times your rank in this archetype to your \glossterm{hit points} (see \pcref{Hit Points}).

        \begin{activeability}{Animate Plants}[\abilitytag{Manifestation}]

            \rankline
            Make an attack vs. Reflex against one Large or smaller \glossterm{grounded} creature within \medrange.
            You gain a \plus2 accuracy bonus if the target is in \glossterm{undergrowth}.

            \hit The target is \slowed as a \glossterm{condition}.
            In addition, it takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage immediately, and during each of your subsequent actions while this condition lasts.

            This condition can be removed if the target makes a \glossterm{difficulty value} 10 Strength check as a \glossterm{movement} to break the plants.
            If the target makes this check as a standard action, it gains a \plus5 bonus.
            In addition, this condition is removed if the target takes fire damage.
            \crit The condition must be removed an additional time before the effect ends.
            \rankline
            For each rank beyond 3, the attack's \glossterm{accuracy} increases by \plus2 and the \glossterm{difficulty value} to break the plants increases by 2.
            In addition, the damage increases at each rank as described below.
            \rank{4} 1d10 bludgeoning damage.
            \rank{5} 2d6 bludgeoning damage.
            \rank{6} 2d8 bludgeoning damage.
            \rank{7} 2d10 bludgeoning damage.
        \end{activeability}

        \cf{Tre}[4]{Tall as the Noble Pine} Your size category increases to Large.
        This would normally increase your \glossterm{base speed} to 40 feet.
        However, you take a \minus10 foot penalty to your base speed, so it is still 30 feet.
        You also gain a \plus1 bonus to your Strength, and a \minus1 penalty to your Dexterity.

        \cf{Tre}[5]{Nourishing Ingrain+} The healing from your \textit{nourishing ingrain} ability increases to three times your rank in this archetype.
        In addition, removing a condition with that ability no longer increases your fatigue level.

        \cf{Tre}[6]{Sturdy as the Mighty Oak+} The hit point bonus increases to four times your rank in this archetype.

        \cf{Tre}[7]{Tall as the Noble Pine+} Your size category increases to Huge.
        This increases your \glossterm{base speed} to 40 feet.
        The modifiers to Strength and Dexterity increase to \plus2 and \minus2, respectively.

\section{Tiefling}
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{optional rules/tiefling}

    Tieflings are humanoid creatures descended from fiends.
    They inherit a tendency towards evil from their ancestors, and are therefore viewed with great suspicion by most civilized societies.
    Good-aligned tieflings exist, but they may have difficulty using their natural talents for subterfuge and deceit for noble ends, and they often struggle with hidden vices.

    \parhead{Size} Medium.
    \parhead{Attributes} No change.

    \begin{itemize}
        \itemhead{Darkvision} Tieflings have \trait{darkvision} with a 60 foot range, allowing them to see in complete darkness (see \pcref{Darkvision}).
        \itemhead{Demonic Prejudice} Most people have negative associations with tieflings thanks to the malign influence that demons have on the world.
            Tieflings have an Opposition relationship with most people that they meet, which influences people's behavior and makes Persuasion checks harder (see \pcref{Persuasion}).
            People in some locations, such as the Abyss, do not have this attitude.
        \itemhead{Hellfire Tolerance} Tieflings are \trait{impervious} to fire damage.
        \itemhead{Infernal Presence} Tieflings gain a \plus2 bonus to the Deception and Intimidate skills.

            You cannot choose tiefling as your base class.
    \end{itemize}

                    Harming the target is not limited to dealing it damage, but also includes causing it significant subjective discomfort.

\section{Vampire}
    A vampire is an undead creature that must drink the blood of living creatures to survive.
    Unlike most undead creatures, vampires appear to be alive and human, allowing them to act normally in society.
    Vampires have great power, but also many dangerous weaknesses.

    \parhead{Creature Type} Unlike most other playable species, vampires are undead instead of humanoids.
    \parhead{Size} Medium.
    \parhead{Attributes} \plus1 Strength and Dexterity, \minus1 Constitution.
    \parhead{Special Abilities}
    \begin{itemize}
        \itemhead{Climb Speed} Vampires have a \glossterm{climb speed} 10 feet slower than their \glossterm{base speed}.
        \itemhead{Darkvision} Vampires have \trait{darkvision} with a 90 foot range, allowing them to see in complete darkness (see \pcref{Darkvision}).
        \itemhead{Fangs} Vampires have a bite natural weapon (see \tref{Natural Weapons}).
            These fangs retract when not in use, so vampires cannot be identified as non-human by their fangs unless they choose to expose them.
        \itemhead{Undead} Vampires are \trait{undead} instead of \glossterm{living}, and they take damage from most healing effects (see \pcref{Undead})).
        \itemhead{Unnatural Charm} Vampires gain a \plus3 bonus to the Persuasion skill.
        \itemhead{Vampire Archetype} Vampires only gain two class archetypes instead of three.
            Instead, they treat the Vampire archetype as one of their archetypes, and they gain ranks in it just like they gain ranks in class archetypes.
    \end{itemize}

    \parhead{Special Weaknesses}
        Vampires have a number of specific weaknesses.
    \begin{itemize}
        \itemhead{Blood Dependence} For every 24 hours that a vampire remains awake without ingesting at least one pint of blood from living creatures, its maximum hit points are reduced by 20.
        If its maximum hit points are reduced to 0 in this way, it dies and withers away into a pile of ash.
        This penalty is removed as soon as the vampire drinks a pint of blood.
        A vampire can can enter a torpor to survive indefinitely without blood.
        While in a torpor, it is unconscious until it smells blood nearby.
        \itemhead{Garlic} Whenever a vampire smells or touches garlic, it takes 10 energy damage and becomes \frightened by any creatures bearing garlic as a condition.
        This damage is repeated at the during each subsequent \glossterm{action phase} that the vampire spends exposed to garlic.
        \itemhead{Holy Water} Whenever a vampire takes damage from holy water, it becomes \stunned as a condition.
        \itemhead{Running Water} Whenever a vampire touches or flies over running water, it takes 10 energy damage and \glossterm{briefly} becomes \immobilized.
        This applies as long as the vampire is within 100 feet of the running water, even the water is underground or under a bridge.
        It can use the \ability{struggle} ability to move despite being immobilized, but only towards the closest shore.
        This damage is repeated at the during each subsequent \glossterm{action phase} that the vampire spends touching or flying over running water.
        \itemhead{Silver} Vampires are \vulnerable to strikes using silvered weapons.
        \itemhead{True Sunlight} Whenever a vampire is exposed to true sunlight, it takes 20 energy damage and becomes \blinded as a condition.
        If it suffers a \glossterm{vital wound} from this damage, it immediately dies and dissolves into a pile of ash.
        This damage is repeated at the during each subsequent \glossterm{action phase} that the vampire spends in true sunlight.
        \itemhead{Unmirrored} Vampires have no reflection in mirrors, including their clothes and equipment.
        This can allow careful observers to identify vampires.
        \itemhead{Wooden Stakes} If a vampire loses hit points from a critical strike using a wooden stake, the stake becomes impaled in its heart.
        The vampire becomes \paralyzed until the stake is removed.
        A wooden stake is a light improvised weapon that deals 1d4 piercing damage.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Vampire Archetype}

        \cf{Vmp}[1]{Blood Drain} Whenever a living creature loses hit points from a \glossterm{strike} using your bite natural weapon, you can increase your \glossterm{fatigue level} by one.
        When you do, you regain \glossterm{damage resistance} and \glossterm{hit points} at the end of the round.
        The recovery is equal to the hit points the target lost from the attack, ignoring any extra damage from critical hits.

        \cf{Vmp}[2]{Gentle Fangs} Whenever you deal damage using your bite natural weapon, you can choose not to reduce the target's hit points below 0, or you can treat the damage as \glossterm{subdual damage}.
        In addition, damage dealt using your bite natural weapon does not wake sleeping creatures unless you inflict a vital wound.

        \magicalcf{Vmp}[2]{Reviving Coffin} You can designate a coffin as your home by resting in it for 24 consecutive hours.
        When you take a \glossterm{long rest} in your home coffin, you recover two \glossterm{vital wounds} instead of one.
        In addition, you can cross running water without penalty while in your home coffin.

        When you die, if your corpse is placed in your home coffin, you can be resurrected after 24 hours.
        You can only be resurrected in this way if you were killed by a vital wound with a \glossterm{vital roll} of \minus3 or higher.
        If you were killed by a more severe vital wound, or by some other effect, even your home coffin cannot save you.

        \magicalcf{Vmp}[3]{Charming Gaze}
        \begin{magicalsustainability}{Charming Gaze}{\abilitytag{Emotion}, \abilitytag{Subtle}, \abilitytag{Sustain} (minor), \abilitytag{Visual}}
            \abilityusagetime Standard action.
            \rankline
            Make an attack vs. Mental against all humanoid creatures in a \largearea cone from you.
            You take a \minus10 penalty to \glossterm{accuracy} with this attack against creatures who have made an attack or been attacked since the start of the last round.
            \hit The target is \charmed by you.
            Any act by you or by creatures that appear to be your allies that threatens or harms the charmed person breaks the effect.
            Harming the target is not limited to dealing it damage, but also includes causing it significant subjective discomfort.
            An observant target may interpret overt threats to its allies as a threat to itself.

            \rankline
            The attack's \glossterm{accuracy} increases by \plus2 for each rank beyond 3.
        \end{magicalsustainability}

        \magicalcf{Vmp}[4]{Creature of the Night}
        \begin{magicalattuneability}{Creature of the Night}{\abilitytag{Attune}}
            \abilityusagetime Standard action.
            \rankline
            You \glossterm{shapeshift} into the form of a Tiny bat, a Medium cloud of mist, or your normal humanoid form.
            \begin{raggeditemize}
                \item Bat: While in your bat form, you gain \trait{blindsense} (120 ft.) and \trait{blindsight} (30 ft.).
                    You cannot speak and have no \glossterm{free hands}.
                    All of your normal movement modes are replaced with a 40 foot fly speed with a 60 ft. height limit.
                \item Mist: While in your mist form, you become \trait{floating}, \trait{intangible}, and \trait{legless}.
                    You cannot speak and have no \glossterm{free hands}.
                    All of your normal movement modes are replaced with a 20 foot \\glossterm{fly speed} with a 30 foot \\glossterm{height limit} (see \\pcref{Flight}).
            \end{raggeditemize}

            In either non-humanoid form, you are unable to take any standard action other than \glossterm{movement}.
            Since you have no land speed, flying in those forms does not penalize your Armor or Reflex defenses.
            You cannot use this ability while \paralyzed.
        \end{magicalattuneability}

        \magicalcf{Vmp}[4]{Reviving Coffin+} You can designate up to three home coffins, rather than only one.
        This can allow you to travel with one coffin while keeping others safe for emergencies.

        \cf{Vmp}[5]{Unholy Perfection} Choose any two attributes other than Constitution.
        You gain a \plus1 bonus to those two attributes.

        \magicalcf{Vmp}[6]{Dominating Gaze}
        \begin{magicalactiveability}{Dominating Gaze}{\abilitytag{Emotion}, \abilitytag{Visual}}
            \abilityusagetime Standard action.
            \rankline
            Make an attack vs. Mental against a humanoid creature within \shortrange.
            \hit The target is \stunned as a \glossterm{condition}.
            While it has no remaining \glossterm{damage resistance}, it is \confused instead of stunned.
            \crit If the target is humanoid and was already confused from a previous use of this ability, you may \glossterm{attune} to this ability.
            When you do, the target becomes \dominated by you for the duration of that attunement.

            \rankline
            The attack's \glossterm{accuracy} increases by \plus2 for each rank beyond 6.
        \end{magicalactiveability}

        \magicalcf{Vmp}[7]{Blood Drain+} Using your \ability{blood drain} ability does not increase your fatigue level.

        \magicalcf{Vmp}[7]{Eternal Undeath} Your \ability{reviving coffin} ability can revive you from any cause of death or severity of vital wound.
        As long as some part of your corpse, even just a pinch of ash, is placed inside one of your home coffins, you will resurrect after 24 hours.
        Only the destruction of all of your home coffins or the total annihilation of your corpse can prevent your return.
