    \subsection{Magic Sources}
        There are four \glossterm{magic sources} that characters can use to cast spells and perform rituals: arcane (cast by mages), divine (cast by clerics and paladins), nature (cast by druids), and pact (cast by warlocks).
        Each magic source has a set of associated \glossterm{mystic spheres} (see Mystic Spheres, below).
        % TODO: more description

        \subsubsection{Characters with Multiple Magic Sources}
            A character can have access to multiple sources of magic through the use of abilities like the Hybrid Training ability (see \pcref{Half-Elves}).
            The \glossterm{mystic spheres}, spells, and rituals that character knows are tracked separately for each source of magic that character has access to.
            If you have access to the same spell or ritual from multiple sources, the two versions of the ability are generally considered to be the same ability.
            When you cast the spell or perform the ritual, you choose which source you are using for the ability.

    \subsection{Mystic Spheres}
        A \glossterm{mystic sphere} is a collection of thematically related magical effects that includes both \glossterm{spells} and \glossterm{rituals}.
        Each \glossterm{mystic sphere} can be associated with any number of \glossterm{magic sources}.
        The mystic spheres are listed at \pcref{Mystic Sphere Lists}.

\section{Spell and Ritual Mechanics}\label{Spell and Ritual Mechanics}

    Spells and rituals share many common properties, defined here.

    \subsection{Ability Tags}
        All spells have the \glossterm{Spell} \glossterm{ability tag}, and all rituals have the \glossterm{Ritual} ability tag.
        Since spells and rituals are already clearly indicated in this chapter, the tags are omitted here for convenience.
        Elsewhere in this book, such as in monster descriptions, those tags are used to indicate that some abilities are considered spells and rituals.

    \subsection{Casting Components}\label{Casting Components}
        Unless otherwise noted, all spells and rituals require both \glossterm{verbal components} to cast or perform.
        In addition, arcane spells, pact spells, and all rituals require \glossterm{somatic components}.
        You cannot start casting a spell or performing a ritual without all required components.
        If you lose those components before the ability resolves, it is \glossterm{miscast}.

        To provide the verbal component for a spell or ritual, you must speak in a strong voice with a volume at least as loud as ordinary conversation.
        To provide the somatic component for a spell or ritual, you must make a measured and precise movement of at least one free hand.

        \subsubsection{Somatic Component Failure}\label{Somatic Component Failure}
            Encumbrance from armor interferes with the \glossterm{somatic components} required to perform arcane spells, pact spells, and all rituals.
            When you cast a spell or perform a ritual that requires \glossterm{somatic components} while you have an \glossterm{encumbrance}, you must roll 1d10.
            If your result is less than or equal to your \glossterm{encumbrance}, you \glossterm{miscast} the ability (see \pcref{Miscasting}).
            When you perform a ritual, this roll must be repeated at the end of each round during the ritual.

    \subsection{Miscasting}\label{Miscasting}

        If you start using a spell or ritual and fail to complete it successfully for any reason, you miscast it.
        A miscast spell or ritual does not have its normal effect.
        Instead, a wave of magical energy causes a \glossterm{miscast backlash}.
        When a mystic backlash occurs, make an attack against the Mental defense of yourself and all creatures in a 5 foot radius from you.
        Your \glossterm{power} with this ability is equal to your \glossterm{power} with the spell or ritual you tried to use.
        % This breaks the normal dice pool patterns.
        % However, not applying power makes it unlikely that this will be useful for optimized builds.
        % Since it's hard to add a large number of +1d increments on the fly, it's annoying to play
        % with a more standard damage progression like (1d6 +1d per rank plus half power).
        On a hit, each target takes energy damage equal to 1d6 per rank of the spell or ritual (minimum 1d6).

        \parhead{Impossible Spells and Rituals} When you try to use a spell or ritual in an impossible way, the ability is \glossterm{miscast} instead.
        This most commonly happens if you attempt to declare an invalid target for a spell.
        For example, if you try to cast a spell that only affects living creatures on a creature that is undead, the spell would be miscast.

        % TODO: This may be more clear if minor + no miscast becomes a tag.
        \parhead{Minor Action Spells} Spells that require a \glossterm{minor action} to cast do not cause a \glossterm{miscast backlash}, even if they are \glossterm{miscast}.

    \subsection{Dismissal}
        As a \glossterm{minor action}, you can dismiss any spells or rituals you used that have lasting effects.
        This requires the same casting components (verbal and somatic) as casting the spell or performing the ritual normally.
        Spells and rituals can also be dismissed in other ways, such as after their effects have finished.
        When a spell or ability is dismissed, all of its lingering effects immediately end.
        % Should a spell be dismissed for all targets simultaneously, or per target?

    \subsection{Resurrecting the Dead}\label{Resurrecting the Dead}
        Several rituals have the power to restore dead characters to life.

        When a living creature dies, its soul departs its body, travels through the Astral Plane, and goes to abide on the plane where the creature's deity resides.
        If the creature did not worship a deity, its soul departs to the plane corresponding to its alignment.
        Bringing a creature back from the dead means retrieving their soul and returning it to their body.

        \parhead{Death and Old Age} While a creature is dead, it still tracks that time towards its maximum age.
        A creature's maximum age is largely determined by the strength of its soul, not the condition of its body.
        No magic can return a creature to life when it has passed its maximum age.

        \parhead{Preventing Resurrection} Enemies can take steps to make it more difficult for a character to be returned from the dead.
        Except for \spell{true resurrection}, every ritual to raise the dead requires a body, so keeping or destroying the body is an effective deterrent.
        The \spell{soul bind} ritual prevents any sort of revivification unless the soul is first released.

        \parhead{Involuntary Resurrection} A soul cannot be returned to life if it does not wish to be.
        A soul infallibly knows the name, alignment, and patron deity (if any) of the character attempting to revive it and may refuse to return on that basis.

    \subsection{Functioning Like Other Spells}\label{Functioning Like Other Spells}
        Many spells and rituals say they "function like" some other spell or ritual, often with some noted changes.
        Except as otherwise noted, they retain all of the original effects and targets of the spell.
        However, they do not have the same rank upgrades as the original spell or ritual.

\section{Spells}\label{Spells}
    % TODO: better description
    A \glossterm{spell} is a discrete magical effect with a name, a \glossterm{rank}, and an effect.
    Each \glossterm{mystic sphere} has a number of spells associated with it.
    An ability that gives you access to \glossterm{mystic spheres} will define how many spells you know.
    A spell's \glossterm{rank} is the minimum \glossterm{archetype rank} you must have in the relevant spellcasting archetype to be able to learn and cast the spell.

    \subsection{Cantrips}\label{Cantrips}
        Some \glossterm{mystic spheres} have minor spells called cantrips.
        Anyone who has access to a mystic sphere knows all cantrips from that sphere.

\section{Rituals}\label{Rituals}
    Each \glossterm{mystic sphere} has a number of \glossterm{rituals}.
    Some spellcasting characters can learn and perform rituals.
    Rituals are ceremonies that create magical effects.
    Like spells, each ritual has a name, a \glossterm{rank}, and an effect.
    Although rituals are similar to spells, abilities that affect spells do not affect rituals unless they say they do in their descriptions.
    % Oddly located
    A ritual's \glossterm{rank} is the minimum \glossterm{archetype rank} you must have in the relevant spellcasting archetype to be able to learn and perform the ritual.

    You don't memorize a ritual as you would a normal spell.
    Rituals are too complex for all but the most knowledgeable sages to commit to memory.
    To perform a ritual, you need to read from a book or a scroll containing it.
    You must have access to the \glossterm{mystic sphere} a ritual is from in order to perform the ritual.

    \subsection{Ritual Descriptions}
        % TODO: proper chapter references
        Rituals are described in the body of the \glossterm{mystic sphere} they are associated with, following the description of spells from that mystic sphere.

    \subsection{Ritual Books}
        A ritual book contains one or more rituals that you can use as frequently as you want, as long as you can spend the time and \glossterm{fatigue points} to perform the ritual.
        Scribing a ritual in a ritual book costs an amount of precious inks.

    \subsection{Ritual Costs}\label{Ritual Costs}
        The costs to scribe rituals are described on \trefnp{Ritual Costs}.
        \begin{dtable}
            \lcaption{Ritual Costs}
            \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{X l l}
                \tb{Ritual Rank} & \tb{Cost to Scribe} & \tb{Item Level} \tableheaderrule
                1 & 50 gp     & 1st  \\
                2 & 125 gp     & 2nd  \\
                3 & 800 gp     & 5th  \\
                4 & 2,750 gp   & 8th  \\
                5 & 10,000 gp  & 11th \\
                6 & 37,000 gp  & 14th \\
                7 & 125,000 gp & 17th \\
                8 & 400,000 gp & 20th \\
            \end{dtabularx}
        \end{dtable}

    \subsection{Performing Rituals}
        To perform a ritual, you must have a ritual book containing the ritual and the material components required for the ritual.
        Some rituals cause the creatures performing them to gain \glossterm{fatigue points}, as indicated in their descriptions.
        Other creatures can suffer this fatigue to help you perform rituals; see Ritual Participants, below.

        % The fatigue point cost for 24 hour rituals is equal to (ritual rank ^ 2) * 2.
        % Should this be specified explicitly?

        \subsubsection{Ritual Participants}
            Creatures can assist in the performance of rituals even if they are unable to perform rituals themselves.
            A creature that helps perform a ritual is called a ritual participant, and the creature performing the ritual is called the ritual leader.
            A ritual participant may gain an fatigue point in place of or in addition to the fatigue point gained by the creature performing the ritual.
            If multiple creatures are willing to gain fatigue points points or attune to effects, the ritual leader decides which creatures gain fatigue points or attune to the ritual's effects.

            The steps required to participate in rituals can be complex.
            Ritual participants must be given specific instructions for the actions they must perform during a ritual by a creature who knows how to perform the ritual.
            This instruction generally takes half the time required to perform the ritual.
            A creature cannot participate in rituals unless it has an Intelligence of at least 0, can speak at least one language, and has the fine motor control required to perform the \glossterm{somatic components} of rituals.

            Normally, a ritual participant can only contribute one \glossterm{fatigue point}.
            If the participant has access to the same \glossterm{magic source} as the ritual, they can contribute any number of \glossterm{fatigue points} (until they drop unconscious).
            Creatures willing to gain fatigue points generally gain them at a rate no faster than one fatigue point per ten minutes spent performing the ritual.

            \parhead{Changing Ritual Participation}
            Rituals are deeply complex magic, and they cannot be abandoned or paused partway through.
            If the number of ritual participants in a ritual decreases below its initial value, the ritual fails at the end of the next round if the number of participants is not restored.
            However, ritual participants can transfer their participation to other creatures without disrupting the ritual.

            In order to transfer ritual participation, the new creature must be able to participate in the ritual.
            Similarly, the ritual leader can transfer their leadership to another creature.
            In addition to the requirements for transferring ritual participation, the new leader must know the ritual and be able to perform it themselves.

            Changing ritual participation and leadership is usually done when performing extraordinarily long or demanding rituals.

            \parhead{Attunement Rituals}
                Rituals with the \glossterm{Attune} (ritual) tag require a single ritual participant to \glossterm{attune} to the ritual's effect.
                Any ritual participant can attune to the effect, but only one ritual participant can attune to the effect unless otherwise noted in the ritual's description.
                For details, see \pcref{Attunement}.

    \subsection{Magical Writings}
        To record a spell in written form, a character uses complex notation that describes the magical forces involved in the spell.
        The notation constitutes a universal language that spellcasters have discovered, not invented.
        Each writer uses this universal system regardless of their native language or culture.
        However, each character uses the system in their own way.
        Another person's magical writing remains incomprehensible to even the most powerful spellcaster until they take the time to study and decipher it.

        You can identify magical writing using the Spellsense skill (see \pcref{Identify Magical Writing}).
