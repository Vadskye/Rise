Choose a plane that connects to your current plane, and a location within that plane.
This ritual creates an interdimensional connection between your current plane and the location you choose, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction.
The gate takes the form of a \areasmall radius circular disk, oriented a direction you choose (typically vertical).
It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through it is shunted instantly to the other location.
The gate cannot be \glossterm{sustained} for more than 5 rounds, and is automatically dismissed at the end of that time.

You must specify the gate's destination with a precise mental image of its appearance.
The image does not have to be perfect, but it must unambiguously identify the location.
Incomplete or incorrect mental images may result in the ritual leading to an unintended destination within the same plane, or simply failing entirely.

You can cast this spell as a \glossterm{minor action}.
\end{ability}
\vspace{0.25em}



\begin{ability}[\nth{4}]{Temporal Duplicate}[\glossterm{Temporal}]
Choose a willing creature within \rngmed range.
You reach into a possible future and create a duplicate of the target.
The duplicate is identical in all ways to the target when the spell resolves, except that it has no \glossterm{legend points}.
The target and its duplicate can act during the next round.
At the end of that round, the target and its duplicate cease to exist.
At the end of the following round, the target reappears in the place where it ceased to exist.
If that space is occupied, it appears in the closest unoccupied space.

When the target reappears, its condition is unchanged from when it left, except that it loses all action points, spell points, and all similar resources equal to the amount used by its duplicate.
Its hit points, conditions, and all other statistics are unaffected, regardless of any damage or other negative effects suffered by the duplicate.
If this would reduce any of the target's resources below 0, it takes physical \glossterm{standard damage} \plus4d from the paradox and becomes \glossterm{stunned} as a \glossterm{condition}.

You can cast this spell as a \glossterm{minor action}.

\vspace{0.25em}



\begin{ability}[\nth{7}]{Greater Time Lock}[\glossterm{Attune} (self), \glossterm{Temporal}]
This spell functions like the \textit{time lock} spell, except that the effect is not ended if the target dies, and restoring the target's state can also restore it to life.
If the target is restored to life in this way, all of its properties not locked by this spell, such as any resources expended, are identical to what they were when the target died.
In addition, this spell has the \glossterm{Attune} (self) tag instead of the \glossterm{Sustain} (minor) tag.

\begin{ability}[\nth{7}]{Time Stop}[\glossterm{Temporal}]

Choose an unattended, nonmagical object within \rngclose range.
Time does not pass for the target, preventing it from decaying or spoiling.
This can extend the time a poison or similar item lasts before becoming inert.
% What effects have an explicit time limit?
If used on a corpse, this effectively extends the time limit for effects that require a fresh or intact body.
Additionally, this can make transporting a fallen comrade more pleasant.

Make an attack vs. Mental against a creature within \rngmed range.
\hit As a \glossterm{condition}, the target is compelled to dance.
It can spend a \glossterm{move action} to dance, if it is physically capable of dancing.
At the end of each round, if the target did not dance during that round, it takes a \minus2 penalty to \glossterm{accuracy}, \glossterm{checks}, and \glossterm{defenses} as the compulsion intensifies.
This penalty stacks each round until the target dances, which resets the penalties to 0.

\begin{ability}[\nth{1}]{Summon Monster}[\glossterm{Manifestation}, \glossterm{Sustain} (minor)]
You summon a creature in an unoccupied square within \rngmed range.
It visually appears to be a common Small or Medium animal of your choice, though in reality it is a manifestation of magical energy.
Regardless of the appearance and size chosen, the creature has hit points equal to twice your \glossterm{power}.
All of its defenses are equal to your 4 \add your \glossterm{power}, and its \glossterm{land speed} is equal to 30 feet.

Each round, you choose the creature's actions.
There are only two actions it can take.
As a move action, it can move as you direct.
As a standard action, it can make a melee \glossterm{strike} against a creature it threatens.
Its accuracy is equal to your \glossterm{accuracy}.
If it hits, it deals \glossterm{standard damage} \minus1d.
The type of damage dealt by this attack depends on the creature's appearance.
Most animals bite or claw their foes, which deals bludgeoning and slashing damage.

Its accuracy is the same as its accuracy with \glossterm{strikes}.
While grappling, the manifested creature can either make a strike or attempt to escape the grapple.

This augment replaces the effects of any other augments that change the appearance of the creature.

You can create any weapon, shield, or body armor that you are proficient with, and which would normally be made entirely from metal, except for heavy body armor.
The body targeted must be at least as large as the item you create.

\begin{ability}[\nth{2}]{Earthbind}[\glossterm{Earth}]
Make an attack vs. Fortitude against a creature within \rngmed range that is within 50 feet of the ground.
\hit As a \glossterm{condition}, the target is pulled towards the ground with great force, approximately quadrupling the gravity it experiences.
This imposes a \minus4 penalty to \glossterm{accuracy}, physical \glossterm{checks}, and \glossterm{defenses}.
In addition, most flying creatures are unable to fly with this increased gravity and crash to the ground.
\end{ability}
\vspace{0.25em}



\begin{ability}[\nth{2}]{Earthen Fortification}[\glossterm{Attune} (self), \glossterm{Earth}, \glossterm{Manifestation}]
You construct a fortification made of packed earth within \rngmed range.
This takes the form of up to ten contiguous 5-foot squares, each of which is four inches thick.
The squares can be placed at any angle and used to form any structure as long as that structure is stable.
Since the fortifications are made of packed earth, their maximum weight is limited, and structures taller than ten feet high are usually impossible.
% TODO: define hit points and hardness of earth

The fortifications form slowly, rather than instantly.
The structure becomes complete at the end of the action phase in the next round after this spell is cast.
This makes it difficult to trap creatures within structures formed.

\begin{ability}[\nth{2}]{Meld into Stone}[\glossterm{Attune} (self), \glossterm{Earth}]
Choose a stone object you can touch that is at least as large as your body.
You and up to 100 pounds of nonliving equipment meld into the stone.
If you try to bring excess equipment into the stone, the spell is \glossterm{miscast}.

As long as the spell lasts, you can move within the stone as if it was thick water.
However, at least part of you must remain within one foot of the place you originally melded with the stone.
You gain no special ability to breathe or see while embedded the stone, and you cannot speak if your mouth is within the stone.
The stone muffles sound, but very loud noises may reach your ears within it.
If you fully exit the stone, this spell ends.

If this spell ends before you exit the stone, or if the stone stops being a valid target for the spell (such as if it is broken into pieces), you are forcibly expelled from the stone.
When you are forcibly expelled from the stone, you take 4d10 bludgeoning damage and become \glossterm{nauseated} as a \glossterm{condition}.

Choose a \areamed radius within \rngmed range.
All earth and unworked stone within the area is softened into a thick sludge, creating a quagmire that is difficult to move through.
The movement cost required to move out of each affected square within the area is quadrupled.
This does not affect objects under significant structural stress, such as walls and support columns.

\hit The target is \glossterm{immobilized}.
As long as the target is immobilized in this way,
it takes bludgeoning \glossterm{standard damage} \minus1d at the end of each \glossterm{action phase} in subsequent rounds.
This immobilization can be removed by climbing out of the fissure, which requires a \glossterm{DR} 10 Climb check as a \glossterm{move action}.
Alternately, an ally that can reach the target can make a Strength check against the same DR to pull the target out.
