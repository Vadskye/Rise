\section{Ability Tags}\label{Ability Tags}

    \abilitytagdef{Attune} Attune abilities require an \glossterm{attunement point} to maintain.
    For details, see \pcref{Attuned Abilities}.

    \abilitytagdef{Auditory} Auditory abilities use sound to cause their effects.
    Creatures and objects that cannot hear the effect are immune to it.

    \abilitytagdef{Compulsion} Compulsion abilities forcibly alter a creature's actions, but do not necessarily affect its opinions or personality.
    They have no effect on objects or creatures without minds.

    \abilitytagdef{Creation} Creation abilities create permanent physical objects.
    Objects created with Creation abilities are identical to objects created through more mundane means.

    \abilitytagdef{Curse} Curse abilities lay supernatural curses on their targets.
    They cannot be \glossterm{dismissed}, but can be removed with the \spell{dispel curse} spell.

    \abilitytagdef{Detection}\label{Detection} Detection abilities reveal magical auras or information within an area.
    They can penetrate up to 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.
    For its ability to penetrate other materials, use the most similar substance from the list above.

    \abilitytagdef{Emotion} Emotion abilities alter a creature's opinons or personality, but do not necessarily affect their actions.
    They have no effect on objects or creatures without minds.

    \abilitytagdef{Healing} This tag indicates that an ability restores hit points.
    When you use most Healing abilities, they \glossterm{briefly} prevent you from using any other Healing abilities.

    \abilitytagdef{Magical} This tag indicates that an ability is \glossterm{magical}, which means that its origin derives from magic.
    For details, see \pcref{Magical Abilities}.

    \abilitytagdef{Manifestation} Manifestation abilities create temporary constructs formed from raw magical energy.
    Objects and creatures created with manifestation abilities seem real on the surface, but they have no internal structure.
    When an object or creature created by a Manifestation ability is destroyed or killed, or when the duration of the ability that created it ends, it disappears without a trace.

    \abilitytagdef{Ritual} Ritual abilities have a number of shared properties.
    For details, see \pcref{Spell and Ritual Mechanics}.

    \abilitytagdef{Scrying} Scrying abilities create one or more invisible magical sensors that send you information.
    Unless otherwise noted, the sensor created has the same powers of sensory acuity that you possess.
    This includes the effect of any abilities which target you personally, such as spells to increase your visual acuity, but not abilities which affect an area around you.
    However, the sensor is treated as a separate, independent sensory organ, and it functions normally even if you have been blinded, deafened, or otherwise suffered sensory impairment.
    \par The sensor can be dismissed as if it were an active spell.
    You cannot create a sensor in a location with lead sheeting between you and the location, and you sense that the effect is blocked in this way.

    \abilitytagdef{Size-Based} Size-Based abilities are limited based on your own size.
    They have no effect on creatures or objects that are more than one size category larger than you.
    You can mitigate this limitation with the \ability{creature climb} ability (see \pcref{Creature Climb}), or simply by flying close (see \pcref{Flying Mechanics}).

    \abilitytagdef{Speech} Speech abilities use words to achieve their ends.
    You must specify a language when using a Speech effect, and the language must be one you know (or have memorized the correct words to say). They have no effect on objects or creatures that do not understand the chosen language.

    \abilitytagdef{Spell} Spell abilities have a number of shared properties.
    For details, see \pcref{Spell and Ritual Mechanics}.

    \abilitytagdef{Subtle} Subtle abilities have no visual or otherwise perceivable manifestation.
    Creatures successfully affected by Subtle abilities do not generally know that they are being influenced.
    However, a creature that successfully resists a Subtle ability can generally notice that it resisted a special effect of some kind, just like a non-Subtle ability.
    You can notice the effects of a Subtle ability on yourself with the Awareness skill (see \pcref{Notice Subtle Effects}).

    \abilitytagdef{Sustain} Sustain abilities require an action to maintain.
    The tag includes an action type, such as (minor), which indicates the type of action required to sustain the ability.
    For details, see \pcref{Sustained Abilities}.

    \abilitytagdef{Swift} Swift abilities take effect before non-Swift abilities used during the same phase.
    For details, see \pcref{Swift Abilities}.

    \abilitytagdef{Visual} Visual abilities use visible objects or forces to cause their effects.
    Creatures and objects that cannot see the effect are immune to it.
    Special vision abilities that replace normal vision entirely, such as \trait{blindsight} and \trait{tremorsense}, are unable to perceive Visual effects.
    A creature that exclusively perceives its surroundings without normal sight, such as by closing its eyes and relying on its blindsight, is unaffected.

\section{Circumstances and Debuffs}\label{Circumstances and Debuffs}

    \debuffdef{blinded} A blinded creature cannot see.
    It automatically fails at actions which depend on vision, including simply seeing the locations of other objects and creatures (but see \pcref{Awareness}).
    In addition, it has a 50\% \glossterm{miss chance} with \glossterm{targeted} attacks.
    It is at least \partiallyunaware of all attacks against it, and it can be fully \unaware as normal depending on its level of awareness.

    \debuffdef{charmed} A charmed creature is mentally influenced to like another creature.
    It always sees the words and actions of the creature that charmed it in the most favorable way, as a close friend or trusted ally.
    A charmed creature cannot be controlled like an automaton, but can be persuaded to take particular actions with the Persuasion skill (see \pcref{Persuasion}).
    It treats the creature that charmed it as a friend (a \plus10 relationship modifier) for the purpose of Persuasion checks.

    \debuffdef{climbing} A creature that is climbing without a \glossterm{climb speed} takes a \minus4 penalty to its \glossterm{accuracy} and Armor and Reflex defenses.

    \debuffdef{confused} A confused creature takes a \minus4 penalty to all defenses and is unable to independently control its actions.
    This penalty does not stack with the \dazed or \stunned effects.
    \confusionexplanation

    \debuffdef{dazed} A dazed creature takes a \minus2 penalty to all defenses.
    This does not stack with the \stunned or \confused effects.

    \debuffdef{dazzled} A dazzled creature has difficulty seeing.
    It loses the benefits of the \trait{darkvision} and \trait{low-light vision} abilities if it has them.
    In addition, it treats everything as if it had \glossterm{concealment}.
    Among other effects, this gives its \glossterm{targeted} attacks a 25\% \glossterm{miss chance}.

    \debuffdef{deafened} A deafened creature cannot hear. It automatically fails at actions which depend on hearing. In addition, it has a 25\% failure chance when casting any spell with verbal components.

    \debuffdef{dominated}[dominate] A dominated creature is mentally compelled to obey another creature.
    It obeys the commands of the creature of the dominated it unquestioningly, as an automaton.
    If it does not understand the language of the creature that dominated it, it still attempts to obey as much as possible, and simple commmands (such as ``attack'' or ``follow'') can usually be communicated successfully.

    \debuffdef{flying} A creature that is flying takes a \minus2 penalty to its Armor and Reflex defenses.
    If it 

    \debuffdef{frightened} A frightened creature takes a \minus4 penalty to \glossterm{accuracy} and Mental defense while it is within \rngmed range of the source of its fear.
    This does not stack with the \shaken or \panicked effects.
    If the source of a frightened creature's fear is \glossterm{defeated}, this effect is broken.

    \debuffdef{goaded} A goaded creature takes a \minus2 penalty to \glossterm{accuracy} against creatures other than the creature that goaded it it as long as it is within \rngmed range of of that creature.
    If the goading creature is \glossterm{defeated}, this effect is broken.
    If a creature is goaded by multiple different creatures simultaneously, it suffers the accuracy penalty on all of its attacks.

    \debuffdef{grappled} A grappled creature is wrestling or in some other form of hand-to-hand struggle with at least one other creature.
    While grappled, you suffer certain penalties and restrictions, as described below.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item You are unable to use one of your hands for any purposes other than grappling.
            This prevents humanoid creatures from taking any actions which would require having two free hands, such as attacking with heavy weapons.
        \item You take a \minus2 penalty to Armor and Reflex defenses.
        \item Abilities that have \glossterm{somatic components} have a 25\% \glossterm{failure chance}.
        \item You cannot move unless you \glossterm{push} all creatures grappling you, such as with the \textit{shove} ability (see \pcref{Shove}).
    \end{itemize}

    Other than the restrictions listed above, you can act normally. You can also try to move the grapple, escape the grapple, or pin your opponent. For details, see \pcref{Grapple Actions}.

    \debuffdef{helpless} A helpless creature is completely at an opponent's mercy.
    It takes a \minus10 penalty to its Armor and Reflex defenses.
    In addition, it is \unaware of all attacks against it.
    The penalty for being unaware does not stack with the penalty for being helpless, but this allows appropriate use of abilities like a rogue's \ability{sneak attack} on helpless creatures.
    Paralyzed, bound, and unconscious creatures are helpless.

    \debuffdef{immobilized} An immobilized creature takes a \minus4 penalty to Reflex defense and can't use any of its movement speeds.
    Immobilized flying creatures that have the ability to hover can maintain their initial altitude.
    % TODO: Fix flying interaction; safest way to descend for non-good maneuverability
    All other flying creatures subjected to this condition descend at a rate of 20 feet per round until they reach the ground, taking no falling damage.
    This does not stack with the \slowed effect.

    \debuffdef{panicked} While a panicked creature is within \rngmed range of the source of its fear, it takes a \minus4 penalty to Mental defense and must flee from the source of its fear by any means necessary.
    If unable to flee, it must do nothing other than use the \textit{total defense} ability every round (see \pcref{Total Defense}).
    The penalty from this effect does not stack with the \frightened or \panicked effects.

    If the source of a panicked creature's fear is \glossterm{defeated}, this effect is broken.

    \debuffdef{paralyzed} A paralyzed creature is unable to take physical actions. It is \helpless, but can take purely mental actions. This can cause flying creatures to crash, swimming creatures to drown, and so on. Any creature can move through a space occupied by a paralyzed creature without slowing down, and creatures can stand in a square with a paralyzed creature without \squeezing.

    \debuffdef{partially unaware} An creature that is partially unaware of an attack knows that it is in danger, but is missing information about the exact location or nature of the attack.
    Creatures take a \minus2 penalty to Armor and Reflex defenses against attacks that they are partially unaware of.
    This penalty does not stack with the penalty for being \unaware.
    For details, see \pcref{Awareness and Surprise}.

    \debuffdef{prone} A prone creature is lying on the ground, rather than standing normally.
    It takes a \minus2 penalty to Armor and Reflex defenses, though it gains a \plus4 bonus to all defenses against ranged \glossterm{strikes}.
    In addition, it takes a \minus2 accuracy penalty.
    It moves at half of its normal speed, and is considered one size category smaller than normal when determining whether it is subject to \abilitytag{Size-Based} effects, including critical hits.

    A creature can stand up from being prone as a \glossterm{move action}.
    This generally requires one \glossterm{free hand}.

    \debuffdef{shaken} A shaken creature takes a \minus2 penalty to \glossterm{accuracy} and Mental defense while it is within \rngmed range of the source of its fear.
    This does not stack with the \frightened or \panicked effects.

    If the source of a shaken creature's fear is \glossterm{defeated}, this effect is broken.

    \debuffdef{slowed} A slowed creature moves at half speed and takes a \minus2 penalty to Reflex defense.
    This does not stack with the \immobilized effect.

    \debuffdef{squeezing} A squeezing creature is trying to move though an area too small for it to fight in normally.
    While squeezing, a creature moves at half speed and takes a \minus2 penalty to \glossterm{accuracy}, as well as Armor and Reflex defenses.
    For details, see \pcref{Squeezing}.

    \debuffdef{stunned} A stunned creature takes a \minus4 penalty to all defenses.
    This does not stack with the \dazed or \confused effects.

    \debuffdef{swimming} A creature that is swimming without a \glossterm{swim speed} takes a \minus4 penalty to its \glossterm{accuracy} and Armor and Reflex defenses.

    \debuffdef{unaware} An creature that is unaware of an attack makes no attempt to defend itself.
    Creatures take a \minus6 penalty to Armor and Reflex defenses against attacks that they are unaware of.
    This penalty does not stack with the penalty for being \partiallyunaware.
    For details, see \pcref{Awareness and Surprise}.

    \debuffdef{unconscious} While you are unconscious, you are \helpless and completely unable to take any actions.
    Some sensory abilities, such as the Awareness skill, can be used while you are asleep, but not while you are forcibly knocked unconscious.

    \debuffdef{underwater} Ranged weapons have difficulty working underwater.
    All ranged weapons have \glossterm{range limits} of 5/15 when used by a creature that is underwater, or when used against a target that is underwater, regardless of the attack's normal range limits or any other modifiers.

\section{Traits}\label{Traits}
    % TODO: should there be subgroups within this section, or should it be strictly alphabetical?
    % A possible subgroup would be "sensory traits".

    \traitdef{Blindsense}{blindsense}
        A creature with blindsense can sense the location of everything in its surroundings.
        It does not need to use its eyes to gain this benefit.
        This ability works regardless of concealment, invisibility, or light levels.
        Blindsense always has a specific range limit, and provides no benefit beyond that range.
        However, it only grants knowledge of location, not actual sight, so does not mitigate any \glossterm{miss chances} that would apply.
        It also does not mitigate \glossterm{cover} or otherwise allow sensing through objects that block \glossterm{line of effect}.

    \traitdef{Blindsight}{blindsight}
        A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings perfectly regardless of concealment, invisibility, or light levels.
        It does not need to use its eyes to gain this benefit.
        This allows the creature to ignore all \glossterm{miss chances} caused by those effects.
        Blindsight always has a specific range limit, and provides no benefit beyond that range.
        It also does not mitigate \glossterm{cover} or otherwise allow sensing through objects that block \glossterm{line of effect}.

    \traitdef{Darkvision}{darkvision}
        A creature with darkvision can see perfectly in both complete darkness and \glossterm{shadowy illumination} just like a human does in \glossterm{bright illumination}.
        Darkvision always has a specific range limit, and provides no benefit beyond that range.
        As long as a creature with darkvision is in \glossterm{bright illumination} or \glossterm{brilliant illumination}, their darkvision stops working.
        The darkvision \glossterm{briefly} stays disabled even after they leave the lit area.
        Darkvision is disabled while you are \dazzled.

    \traitdef{Impervious}{impervious}
        A creature can be impervious to a particular damage type.
        It gains a \plus5 bonus to all defenses against attacks that would cause it to take damage of that type.
        If an attack deals damage of multiple types, a creature is impervious to that attack only if it is impervious to all of the attack's damage types.
        For attacks with random effects, such as the \spell{chromatic orb} spell, determine the random effect before determining if the creature is impervious.
        An impervious creature gains no defensive benefit against attacks that do not deal damage.

    \traitdef{Immune}{immune}
        A creature that is immune to an attack is completely unaffected by it.
        Creatures and objects can be immune to specific damage types or debuffs.
        It is also possible to be immune to more esoteric concepts, like being \grappled or gaining \glossterm{conditions}.

        Being immune to part of an attack does not grant immunity to other aspects of that attack.
        If an attack deals damage of multiple types, a creature is immune to that attack only if it is impervious to all of the attack's damage types.
        This also applies to more specific immunities that are not related to damage types.
        For example, if you are immune to being \dazed, you still take full damage from an attack that deals damage and dazes you.

    \traitdef{Incorporeal}{incorporeal}
        An incorporeal creature does not have a tangible body.
        It is \trait{immune} to \glossterm{physical damage}.
        It moves silently and ignores the effects of abilities that only work if it has a corporeal body, such as \glossterm{difficult terrain} and the \textit{grapple} or \textit{shove} abilities.
        This includes being \grappled, detected by \trait{tremorsense}, setting off pressure plates, and so on.

        Many incorporeal creatures have no Strength attribute.
        If an incorporeal creature has a Strength attribute, it has some ability to manipulate the physical world despite being incorporeal.
        Unless otherwise noted, an incorporeal creature with a Strength attribute may selectively choose whether it wants to interact with physical objects.

        An incorporeal creature can enter or pass through solid objects, but it must remain adjacent to the object's exterior at all times.
        If it is completely inside an object, it cannot see out or attack.
        It can fight while partially inside an object, which grants it \glossterm{cover} and allows it to attack and see normallly.

    \traitdef{Invisible}{invisible}
        An invisible creature or object cannot be seen with light.
        Creatures unable to see an invisible creature are at least \partiallyunaware of its attacks, and they can be fully \unaware as normal depending on their level of awareness.
        Attackers suffer a 50\% \glossterm{miss chance} with \glossterm{targeted} attacks even if they know the location of the invisible creature.
        See \pcref{Awareness}, and \pcref{Stealth}, for how to identify invisible creatures.

    \traitdef{Lifesense}{lifesense}
        Lifesense functions like \trait{blindsense}, except that it only grants knowledge of the location of living creatures.

    \traitdef{Lifesight}{lifesight}
        Lifesight functions like \trait{blindsight}, except that it can only see living creatures.

    \traitdef{Low-light Vision}{low-light vision}
        A creature with low-light vision can see perfectly in \glossterm{shadowy illumination}, just like a human does in \glossterm{bright illumination}.
        This provides no benefit in areas of complete darkness.
        Low-light vision is disabled while you are \dazzled.

    \traitdef{Mindless}{mindless}
        A mindless creature lacks a normally functioning mind.
        Mindless creatures do not have an Intelligence attribute.
        They are immune to \abilitytag{Compulsion} and \abilitytag{Emotion} abilities.

        It is possible for mindless creatures to still act as if they were intelligent through various magical means.
        For example, animated objects can obey simple commands by virtue of the magic that controls them, but they are still mindless.

    \traitdef{Scent}{scent}
        A creature with the scent ability has an unusually good sense of smell.
        It reduces the \glossterm{difficulty value} of scent-based Awareness checks by 10 (see \pcref{Awareness}).

    % TODO: is this really a trait?
    \traitdef{Shapeshift}{shapeshift}
        A creature that can shapeshift can completely transform its physical body into a different shape.
        When a shapeshifted creature dies, it returns to its original form.
        It generally retains all of its original statistics and abilities, with the following exceptions.
        % TODO: are more exceptions necessary?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If the new shape is not normally capable of speech, the creature cannot speak.
                This may prevent it from casting spells with \glossterm{verbal components} and using similar abilities.
            \item The creature is limited by the number of \glossterm{free hands} present in the new form.
                In addition, it cannot gain more free hands by shapeshifting than it originally had in its base form.
                Even if you shapeshift to a form with many hands, you do not have the mental coordination necessary to use them all effectively.
        \end{itemize}

        When a creature shapeshifts, all of its worn and carried items that are physically incompatible with the creature's new shape meld into its body.
        This does not break \glossterm{attunement}, and the creature still gains the benefit of any magical properties of melded items.
        However, it does not gain the benefit of nonmagical properties from melded items.
        For example, a creature that shapeshifts into an amorphous gas would still benefit from all attuned effects from its equipped items, such as \mitem{boots of speed}.
        However, it would gain no benefit to its Armor defense or damage resistance from any melded body armor, and it would not be able to attack with any of its melded weapons.
        Items exceeding a creature's \glossterm{carrying capacity} are not melded, and simply fall to the ground in place.

    \traitdef{Telepathy}{telepathy}
        A creature with telepathy has the ability to mentally communicate with other nearby creatures.
        All telepathy abilities have a defined \glossterm{range}.
        Unless otherwise specified, a telepathic creature can only communicate with one creature at a time.

        As a \glossterm{free action}, a telepathic creature can open a telepathic communication channel with one creature it sees within the range of its telepathy ability.
        The target does not have to be willing to receive telepathic communication in this way.
        While this channel is open, the telepathic creature can cause the target to ``hear'' the telepathic creature's voice inside the target's head.
        If the target attempts to mentally reply while the channel is open, the telepathic creature can similarly ``hear'' the reply in its head as if the target was speaking.
        This does not generally grant the ability to detect any other thoughts, though exceptionally stupid targets may accidentally broadcast their private thoughts.

        Telepathic communication uses words, so it still requires a shared language to be intelligible, even though the words are only imagined.
        A telepathic creature may attempt to telepathically communicate with creatures without a language, though this is generally unproductive.
        A skilled telepath can customize the mental ``voice'' it projects in the same way that a creature can attempt to disguise or alter its voice when speaking.

    \traitdef{Tremorsense}{tremorsense}
        Tremorsense functions like \trait{blindsense}, except that it requires an uninterrupted path through solid objects instead of \glossterm{line of effect}.
        This makes it incapable of sensing flying creatures, but it ignores \glossterm{cover} and can even sense through solid obstacles that are no more than half a foot thick.

    \traitdef{Tremorsight}{tremorsight}
        Tremorsense functions like \trait{blindsight}, except that it requires an uninterrupted path through solid objects instead of \glossterm{line of effect}.
        This makes it incapable of seeing flying creatures, but it ignores \glossterm{cover} and can even see through solid obstacles that are no more than half a foot thick.

    \traitdef{Vulnerable}{vulnerable}
        A creature can be vulnerable to a particular damage type or debuff.
        It takes a \minus4 penalty to all defenses against attacks that would cause it to take damage of that type, or that would cause it suffer that debuff.
        This penalty applies against the whole attack even if the attack would only inflict the debuff or damage under specific circumstances, such as if the attack gets a critical hit or if the attack causes the creature to lose hit points.
        For attacks with random effects, such as the \spell{chromatic orb} spell, determine the random effect before determining if the creature is vulnerable.
