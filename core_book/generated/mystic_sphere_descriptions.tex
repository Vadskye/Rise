\targetrule
When you cast this spell, you choose a new weather pattern.
You can only choose weather which would be reasonably probable in the climate and season of the area you are in.
For example, you can normally create a thunderstorm, but not if you are in a desert.

When you complete the spell, the weather begins to take effect in a two mile radius cylinder-shaped \glossterm{zone} from your location.
After five minutes, your chosen weather pattern fully takes effect.
% TODO: define weather intensities
You cannot change the intensity of the weather beyond what would be possible without magic during this time frame.
For example, you can change a clear sky into a light thunderstorm, but you cannot create a hurricane or tornado from untroubled air.

You can control the general tendencies of the weather, such as the direction and intensity of the wind.
You cannot control specific applications of the weather, such as the location of lightning strikes.
Contradictory weather conditions are not possible simultaneously.

After the spell's effect ends, the weather continues on its natural course, which may cause your chosen weather pattern to end.
% TODO: This should be redundant with generic spell mechanics
If another ability would magically manipulate the weather in the same area, the most recently used ability takes precedence.

\rankline
\rank{6} You can shape the weather for up to fifteen minutes before it takes effect, increasing the intensity of the changes you can make.
\rank{8} You can cause weather changes that are inappropriate for the climate and season of the area you are in.
Making a weather change that is inappropriate for the local environment takes twice as long as making an appropriate change.

When you cast this spell, you choose how many rounds the target ceases to exist for, up to a maximum of five rounds.
At the end of the last round, it reappears in the same location where it disappeared.

The area the target occupied can be physically crossed, but it is treated as an invalid destination for teleportation and other similar magic.
When the target reappears, all of its surroundings are adjusted as if the object had retroactively always existed in its space.
For example, if the location is occupied by a creature that walked into the area, the creature is relocated to the closest unoccupied space along the path it took to reach the target.

\target{One creature within \rngmed range}
Make an attack vs. Mental against the target.
\hit At the end of each round, if the target took damage that round, it has a 50\% chance to be sent forward in time by one round.

The target is placed into stasis, rendering it unconscious.
While in stasis, it cannot take any actions and cannot be targeted, moved, damaged, or otherwise affected by outside forces in any way.

% TODO: wording
This effect normally lasts as long as you \glossterm{attune} to it, and until the end of the round when you release the attunement.
If you use this ability on yourself, it instead lasts for a number of rounds you choose when you cast the spell, up to a maximum of five rounds.

You can cast this spell as a \glossterm{minor action}.

\begin{freeability}[Rank 4]{\hypertarget{spell:Time Lock}{Time Lock}}[\glossterm{Focus}, \glossterm{Sustain} (minor)]
\target{Yourself or an \glossterm{ally} within \rngmed range}
You lock the state of the target's body in time.
Note the target's \glossterm{hit points}, \glossterm{vital wounds} (including \glossterm{vital roll} results), and \glossterm{conditions}.
If the target dies, this effect ends immediately.

As a \glossterm{standard action}, you can reach through time to restore the target's state.
If you do, the target's \glossterm{hit points} and \glossterm{conditions} become identical to what they were when you cast this spell.
This effect cannot restore \glossterm{vital wounds}.
This does not affect any other properties of the target, such as any resources expended.
After you restore the target's state in this way, the spell ends.

\rankline
\rank{6} The restoration effect can also remove \glossterm{vital wounds} gained since the target was locked.
\rank{8} The effect is not ended if the target dies, and restoring the target's state can also restore it to life.
If the target is restored to life in this way, all of its properties not locked by this spell, such as any resources expended, are identical to what they were when the target died.
You cannot restore yourself to life in this way since you cannot take the action to restore your own state while dead.

\targets{Everything within a \areamed radius \glossterm{zone} from your location}
Make an attack vs. Mental against each target.
Whenever a creature enters the area, you make this attack against them.
A creature that leaves the area and re-enters it uses the original attack result against it.
\hit Each target acts at half speed within the area.
It skips every other round, starting with the round after it becomes affected by this affect.
In addition, it takes a \minus2 penalty to \glossterm{accuracy} and \glossterm{defenses} against creatures moving at normal speed.

\rankline
\rank{7} The area increases to a \arealarge radius zone.

\lowercase{\hypertarget{spell:Temporal Duplicate}{}}\label{spell:Temporal Duplicate}
\begin{freeability}[Rank 5]{\hypertarget{spell:Temporal Duplicate}{Temporal Duplicate}}[\glossterm{Focus}]
\target{Yourself or an \glossterm{ally} within \rngmed range}
You reach into a possible future and create a duplicate of the target.
The duplicate is identical in all ways to the target when the spell resolves.
The target and its duplicate can act during the next round.
At the end of that round, the target and its duplicate cease to exist.
At the end of the following round, the target reappears in the place where it ceased to exist.
If that space is occupied, it appears in the closest unoccupied space.

When the target reappears, its condition is unchanged from when it left, except that it loses \glossterm{action points} equal to the amount used by its duplicate.
Its \glossterm{hit points}, conditions, and all other statistics are unaffected, regardless of any damage or other negative effects suffered by the duplicate.
If this would reduce any of the target's resources below 0, it takes energy \glossterm{standard damage} \plus4d from the paradox and becomes \glossterm{stunned} as a \glossterm{condition}.

You can cast this spell as a \glossterm{minor action}.

\rankline
\rank{7} If you cast this spell as a standard action, you can choose to have the duplicate persist for two rounds instead of one.
If you do, the target disappears for two rounds at the same time as the duplicate.

\begin{freeability}[Rank 8]{\hypertarget{spell:Time Stop}{Time Stop}}[\glossterm{Focus}]
\target{Yourself}
You can take two full rounds of actions immediately.
During this time, all other creatures and objects are fixed in time, and cannot be targeted, moved, damaged, or otherwise affected by outside forces in any way.
You can still affect yourself and create areas or new effects.

You are still vulnerable to danger, such as from heat or dangerous gases.
However, you cannot be detected by any means while you travel.

After casting this spell, you cannot cast it again until you take a \glossterm{short rest}.

\begin{attuneability}[Rank 3]{\hypertarget{spell:Gentle Repose}{Gentle Repose}}[\glossterm{Attune} (ritual), \glossterm{Focus}]
\target{One unattended, nonmagical object within \rngclose range}
Time does not pass for the target, preventing it from decaying or spoiling.
This can extend the time a poison or similar item lasts before becoming inert.
% What effects have an explicit time limit?
If used on a corpse, this effectively extends the time limit for effects that require a fresh or intact body.
Additionally, this can make transporting a fallen comrade more pleasant.

% Does this need to explicitly clarify that it doesn't stop time from passing for the creature's soul?

This ritual takes one minute to perform.

Make an attack vs. Mental against the target.
\hit As a \glossterm{condition}, the target is forced to speak out loud constantly whenever it can.
This does not control what it talks about, so a reasonably savvy creature may be able to avoid revealing anything of great interest.
In combat, most creatures with an intelligence of 0 or less will often talk about what they are planning on doing, which can help you predict their actions.

This spell creates an icy weapon or a suit of icy armor from the target pool of water.
You can create any weapon, shield, or body armor that you are proficient with, and which would normally be made entirely from metal, except for heavy armor.
The pool of water targeted must be at least as large as the item you create.

The item functions like a normal item of its type, except that it is more fragile.
Its \glossterm{vital resistance} is equal to twice your \glossterm{power}, and it is \glossterm{vulnerable} to fire damage.

When a creature wearing armor created in this way takes physical damage, cold damage, or fire damage, that damage is also dealt to the armor.
Likewise, when a creature wielding a weapon created in this way deals damage with the weapon, that damage is also dealt to the weapon.
If the item becomes \glossterm{broken}, this effect is \glossterm{dismissed}.

This spell lasts until you use it again or until you \glossterm{dismiss} it as a \glossterm{free action}.

\rankline
\rank{3} The \glossterm{vital resistance} of the item increases to three times your power.
In addition, you can also create heavy armor.
\rank{5} The item created is magically enhanced.
A weapon grants a \plus2 \glossterm{magic bonus} to \glossterm{power} with \glossterm{mundane} abilities,
and armor grants a \plus1 \glossterm{magic bonus} to Armor defense.
\rank{7} The \glossterm{vital resistance} of the item increases to four times your power.

You summon a creature in the target location.
It visually appears to be a common Small or Medium animal of your choice, though in reality it is a manifestation of magical energy.
Regardless of the appearance and size chosen, the creature's statistics use the values below.
If a summoned creature gains a \glossterm{vital wound} or has no hit points remaining at the end of a phase, it disappears.

\begin{itemize}
\item Its \glossterm{wound resistance} and \glossterm{vital resistance} are equal to the base values for your level (see \pcref{Resistance Values}).
\item It has 6 \glossterm{hit points}.

\item Its \glossterm{land speed} is 30 feet.
\item It has no \glossterm{action points}.

Each round, you can choose the creature's actions by mentally commanding it as a \glossterm{minor action}.
There are only two actions it can take.
As a \glossterm{move action}, it can move as you direct.
As a standard action, it can make a melee \glossterm{strike} against a creature it threatens.
If it hits, it deals physical \glossterm{standard damage} \minus2d.
The subtypes of damage dealt by this attack depend on the creature's appearance.
Most animals bite or claw their foes, which deals bludgeoning and slashing damage.

If you do not command the creature's actions, it will continue to obey its last instructions if possible or do nothing otherwise.
Summoned creatures have no mind or agency, and will not act on their own even if attacked.

% Is this clear enough that you can't use the same gem for this ritual twice?
Choose a nonmagical gem you hold that is worth at least 1,000 gp.
A fragment of the soul of the creature that the target corpse belongs to is imprisoned in the chosen gem.
This does not remove the creature from its intended afterlife.
However, it prevents the creature from being resurrected, and prevents the corpse from being used to create undead creatures, as long as the gem is intact.
A creature holding the gem may still resurrect or reanimate the creature.
If the gem is shattered, the fragment of the creature's soul returns to its body.

This ritual takes one hour to perform.
