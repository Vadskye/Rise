\chapter{Ship Combat}
    Normally, combat that happens on ships is resolved through local-scale combat rules.
    These rules work best if boarding actions are common, and if the main threat comes from other characters.
    If you aren't running a full naval campaign, these rules are generally fine, and most GMs will just handwave the initial exchange of fire between ships before they get in range for boarding actions.
    However, it can be useful to have more comprehensive rules for ship combat, where ships themselves frequently deal and suffer damage.

    This chapter presents optional rules to govern ship-based combat.
    They are designed to still emphasize the importance of individual player actions.
    It is primarily intended for naval campaigns where the players are important crew members and ship combat is expected to be common.
    These rules could also be used for other types of vehicles, such as flying ships in the Astral Plane or zeppelins.

    \section{Ship Statistics}
    Ships use the same basic framework for calculating their statistics as characters and monsters.
    A ship has a level that indicates its general power.
    This represents the sophistication of its construction, how advanced its weapons are, the general competence of its crew, and so on.
    A ship's level determines its hit points, damage resistance, accuracy, defenses, and power, as indicated in the table below.
    These values change based on the ship's attributes, as indicated in \pcref{Ship Attributes}.

    \end{dtable}

    \subsection{Ship HP and DR}
        Ships have hit points and damage resistance, just like characters.
        A ship's base hit points and damage resistance are based on its level, as listed in \tref{Ship Statistics}.
        In addition, a ship gains a bonus based on its Constitution, as listed in \pcref{Ship Attributes}.
        Armor can also give ships a bonus to their damage resistance, as listed in \pcref{Ship Armor}.

    \subsection{Elite Ships}\label{Elite Ships}
        Some ships are designated ``elite'' ships.
        Elite ships are much larger than ordinary ships.
        Even the smallest elite ship requires no less than 10 crew members to operate correctly.

        Elite ships are approximately four times as strong as an ordinary ships.
        They have a number of benefits and modifiers which make them superior to ordinary ships:
        % NOTE: Keep in sync with elite monsters
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Elite ships gain a \plus2 bonus to their \glossterm{power} and all \glossterm{defenses}.
            \item Elite ships have three times the \glossterm{hit points} and \glossterm{damage resistance} of standard ships.
            % \item Elite ships have 50\% more \glossterm{damage resistance} than standard ships. This is applied after the bonus they get from having higher hit points, since ship damage resistance is based on their hit points.
            % \item Elite ships can have a maximum starting attribute of 6 (see \pcref{Ship Attributes}).
            % elite actions should be about as strong as regular actions, so 2x more damage
            \item Elite ships can take an additional \glossterm{elite action} each round (see \pcref{Ship Actions}).
        \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Ship Attributes}
        Unlike characters, ships normally have no Intelligence attribute.
        However, they have Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Perception, and Willpower attributes.
        These represent slightly different narrative concepts than they do for characters.
        In general, a ship's attributes represent a combination of its physical properties and the effectiveness of its crew.
        A highly advanced ship may still have low attributes when its crew is inexperienced or incompetent.

        \subsubsection{Strength}
            Strength measures the power of a ship's physical weapons.
            Ships with a high Strength have more damaging weapons, and a crew capable of keeping those weapons working effectively.
            Ships with a low Strength have ineffective weaponry, or a crew that services those weapons poorly.
            Strength has the following effects on ships:
            \begin{raggeditemize}
                \item Ships add their Strength to their \glossterm{mundane power}.
                \item Some weapons require a minimum ship Strength (see \pcref{Ship Weapons}).
            \end{raggeditemize}

            Unlike characters, a ship's Strength does not affect its carrying capacity.
            That is calculated entirely from its physical size and shape.

        \subsubsection{Dexterity}
            Dexterity measures a ship's agility.
            Ships with a high Dexterity can turn more sharply to avoid incoming fire and may be faster in short bursts.
            Ships with a low Dexterity are lumbering and slow to change direction, making them easy targets.
            Dexterity has the following effects on ships:
            \begin{raggeditemize}
                \item Ships add their Dexterity to their Armor defense.
                    This bonus can be reduced if the ship has medium or heavy armor (see \pcref{Ship Armor}).
                \item Ships add their Dexterity to their Reflex defense.
            \end{raggeditemize}

            As with characters, a ship's Dexterity does not affect its overall speed, simply its combat maneuverability.

        \subsubsection{Constitution}
            Constitution measures a ship's durability.
            Ships with a high Constitution are heavily reinforced and well crafted from sturdy materials.
            Ships with a low Constitution fall apart more easily, either because their construction is poor or because they were made from weak materials.
            Constitution has the following effects on ships:
            \begin{raggeditemize}
                \item Ships add twice their Constitution to their hit points.
                    At level 7, this bonus increases to three times the ship's Constitution.
                    At level 13, this bonus increases to six times the ship's Constitution.
                    At level 19, this bonus increases to twelve times the ship's Constitution.
                \item Ships add their Constitution to their Fortitude defense.
            \end{raggeditemize}

            Constitution is the attribute which is least affected by a ship's current crew, and most affected by its physical properties.

        \subsubsection{Intelligence}
            Intelligence measures a ship's capability for thought and internal control.
            Normal ships have no Intelligence, and a ship's crew does not affect its Intelligence.
            Extremely rare magical ships may have an animating mind that can control the ship.
            For details, see \pcref{Intelligent Ships}.

        \subsubsection{Perception}
            Perception measures a ship's awareness and precision.
            Ships with a high Perception have effective lookouts, excellent gunners, and weapons which are capable of swiftly repositioning for precise attacks.
            Ships with a low Perception are either unable to effectively observe their surroundings or unable to react effectively to those observations.
            Perception has the following effects on ships:
            \begin{raggeditemize}
                \item Ships add their Perception to their level to determine their \glossterm{accuracy} with almost all attacks (see \pcref{Accuracy}).
            \end{raggeditemize}

        \subsubsection{Willpower}
            Willpower measures the morale and emotional steadiness of a ship's crew.
            Ships with a high Willpower are better able to resist setbacks and frightening encounters.
            Ships with a low Willpower may panic and be driven off easily.
            Willpower has the following effects on ships:
            \begin{raggeditemize}
                \item Ships add their Willpower to their Mental defense.
            \end{raggeditemize}

            Willpower is the attribute which is most affected by a ship's current crew.

                Titan      & 16             & Yes         & 100---1000      & Any             & 320 ft.    & 100 ft.    & 50 ft.         & Galleon x2    & \plus4       \\
            \end{dtabularx}
            1. This range indicates the number of crew members that meaningfully contribute to the ship's functions, not the ship's maximum carrying capacity including passengers and cargo.
            It is either difficult or impossible to adequately control a large ship with less than the minimum crew listed here.
            Individual ships may have higher minimum crew requirements or lower maximum allowable crew based on their structure, at the GM's discretion. \\
            2. If the ship is Elite, increase its item rank by an additional \plus1.
        \end{dtable*}

        A ship's size does not directly affect its statistics.
        However, it has many effects on the ship's functionality.
        Larger ships are much more capable than smaller ships.
        Some of these effects are listed below in \trefnp{Ship Size}.
        In addition, advanced ship weapons often require a minimum ship size (see \pcref{Ship Weapons}).

        Some ships can be larger than most creatures and objects are usually defined.
        To track ship size beyond the limits of Colossal, additional Galleon and Titan categories are listed below.
        As usual, each size category represents a doubling of each dimension, and an eightfold increase in weight.
        Titan ships are unlikely to be present at all in many universes, and they require extensive magical reinforcement to function.
        The GM can decide whether their world is advanced enough to construct such monstrosities.

        Some examples of ships of a given size are given below.
        Since ships are typically named for their function and structure, not their size, this is only a rough guide.
        \begin{raggeditemize}
            \item Medium: Single-person kayak
            \item Large: Canoe, lifeboat
            \item Huge: Dinghy, outrigger canoe, punt, skiff
            \item Gargantuan: Felucca, small longship
            \item Colossal: Keelboat, large longship
        \end{raggeditemize}

\section{Ship Movement}
    This section defines the rules that ships use to move, which are not identical to character movement.
    Real ships have a great deal of momentum, and their movement speed and direction cannot be quickly adjusted.
    This is too much of a hassle to represent fully, so Rise uses significantly simplified ship movement mechanics.
    However, ships still have more movement constraints than characters, including a concept of ship heading.

    \subsection{Ship Heading}
        A ship's heading always points in one of the eight standard cardinal directions: north, northeast, east, and so on.
        Forward-moving ships can only move within a 90 degree cone centered on their heading.
        For example, a ship with a heading of north could travel northwest or northeast, but not west or east.
        
        \subsubsection{Turning}
            A ship can change its heading by turning.
            Each ship has a turning cost based on its size.
            That cost is the number of feet that a ship must spend out of its movement to turn by 45 degrees.
            Most ships have a turning cost equal to half their base speed.
            A ship can pay its turning cost twice, allowing it to rotate more quickly while typically making little or no forward progress.

    \subsection{Movement Timing}
        Ships automatically move up to their movement speed during the \glossterm{movement phase}.
        They cannot move during the \glossterm{action phase}.

\section{Ship Armor}
    Like characters, ships can have varying degrees of armor.
    Typically, even a heavily armored ship will not be literally covered in metal sheets.
    Instead, ship armor represents a heavily reinforced hull and extra layers of bracing and redundant infrastructure.

    There are three types of ship armor.
    \begin{raggeditemize}
        \item Light armor: Lightly armored ships are the default. They gain no special benefits or penalties.
        \item Medium armor: Ships with medium armor gain a \plus2 bonus to Armor defense.
            In addition, they have 50\% more damage resistance than a normal ship.
            However, they add only half their Dexterity bonus to their Armor defense.
            In addition, their movement speed is calculated as if they were one size category smaller (see \pcref{Ship Size}).
            Only Huge and larger ships can have medium armor.
        \item Heavy armor: Ships with heavy armor gain a \plus3 bonus to Armor defense.
            In addition, they have twice the damage resistance of a normal ship.
            However, they do not add their Dexterity bonus to their armor defense.
            In addition, their movement speed is calculated as if they were two size categories smaller (see \pcref{Ship Size}).
            Only Gargantuan and larger ships can have heavy armor.
    \end{raggeditemize}

%         \subsubsection{Customized Ship Armor}
%             Individual ships can have different configurations that change their defenses.
%             With customization, a ship can gain a \plus1 bonus to Armor defense, a \plus2 bonus to any other defense, or become \impervious to one of the following damage types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire.
%             In exchange, it must take a \minus1 penalty to Armor defense or a \minus2 penalty to any other defense.
%             Some rare and valuable ships may have unusual properties that grant additional benefits, at the GM's discretion.

\section{Ship Weapons}\label{Ship Weapons}
    Ships depend on having powerful weapons even more than martial characters do.
    They use weapon upgrades as their primary method of scaling damage rather than maneuvers or other special attacks.

    There are two ways that a GM can choose to use ship weapons.
    Real siege weapons used on ships had high crew requirements, slow firing rates, and extreme range.
    In practice, this can reduce ship combat to a slog of tracking reload times across multiple weapons and carefully maneuvering ship range to make the best use of varying weapon types.
    For GMs who want more realistic and unique ship combat, use the weapons listed in \tref{Realistic Ship Weapons}.
    For GMs who want ship combat to feel simpler and more similar to regular combat, use the weapons listed in \tref{Simplified Ship Weapons}.

    \subsection{Ship Weapon Tags}
        Some weapon tags only apply to ship weapons.

        % +1dr for Slow Reload to Slow Load, +1dr for (1) to (2), then +1dr for each subsequent round
        \weapontagdef{Slow Load} This weapon requires multiple rounds to load before it can fire for the first time.
        The number of rounds required to finish loading before it can be fired is indicated in its description.
        For example, a weapon with Slow Load (1) could be fired every other round.
        Only rounds where the weapon is being fully crewed count towards this load time.
        If the weapon is not fired during the round after its loading time is completed, the loading is wasted, and the weapon must be loaded again before it can fire.

        % +2dr for (1) to (2), then +1dr for each subsequent round
        \weapontagdef{Slow Reload} This weapon requires multiple rounds to after being fired.
        The number of rounds required to finish reloading is indicated in its description.
        For example, a weapon with Slow Reload (1) could be fired every other round.
        Only rounds where the weapon is being fully crewed count towards this reload time.
        The weapon can sustain its load for an arbitrary amount of time in combat before being fired.

\section{Crew Roles}
    Ships depend on their crew to function.
    There are many jobs that are necessary to make large ships function, including sailors, rowers, cooks, pages, and more.
    Fully defining life on a ship is outside the scope of this brief introduction to ship combat.
    However, some roles have outsized influence on the ship's effectiveness, such as the ship's captain and pilot.
    These roles provide a way for player characters to meaningfully influence the outcome of ship battles, even if their personal combat talents are irrelevant at those scales.

    Each crew role defined here functions like a class archetype, with seven progression ranks.
    A character can have any number of crew roles, but they can only fulfill one role at a time on a ship.
    In general, your highest crew role rank should not be significantly higher or lower than your highest rank in a class archetype, but they do not have to be kept exactly in sync.
    The GM can decide whether your crew role rank increases in lockstep with your class archetype rank, or whether it increases based on other factors.
    This could include practice and time spent on a ship, or money spent to buy ship improvements necessary to improve your crew role rank.

    Crew role ranks are limited by ship quality.
    Even the best pilot cannot dodge incoming fire with ease on a lifeboat.
    The maximum crew role rank for all crew on a ship is equal to the ship's item rank (see \pcref{Wealth and Item Ranks}).

    A sufficiently large ship can have more than one member of each crew role.
    This does not mean that the ship literally has multiple captains or pilots.
    Instead, the ship would have a hierarchy.
    It might have a boatswain and boatswain's mate, or a pilot and pilot's mate, with both characters able to fully use their crew role abilities.

    \subsection{Boatswain}
        This role is responsible for coordinating the ship's crew.

    \subsection{Fixer}
        This role is responsible for maintaining the ship's physical infrastructure.
        It represents a combination of carpentry, caulking, and similar repair jobs.
        In order to take this role on a ship, you must have at least one Craft skill relevant to the ship's construction.

    \subsection{Gunner}
        This role is responsible for aiming and firing ship weaponry.
        For complex weapons such as ballistas, they also direct the work of other crew members who are physically loading and aiming the weapons.

    \subsection{Lookout}
        This role is responsible for observing and reporting the ship's surroundings.
        It includes watching out for hazardous terrain, enemy ships, and similar dangers or opportunities.

    \subsection{Pilot}
        This role is responsible for steering the ship.
        They generally stay at the ship's wheel, but they may also direct the cut of sails or the direction of rowing.

    \subsection{Warder}
        This role is responsible for directly protecting the ship from danger with magic.

        In order to take this role on a ship, you must be able to cast spells.
        At the GM's discretion, you may also need to have access to mystic spheres that can plausibly be used to protect the ship.
        Most mystic spheres which have spells that affect objects can be used to justify this role.
        However, highly specialized mystic spheres like \sphere{enchantment} or \sphere{vivimancy} may not be sufficient.

\section{Ships Fighting Non-Ships}
    In some cases, ships might enter combat against non-ship foes.
    Ships take one tenth of the normal damage from non-ship attacks, rounded down as usual, so minor attacks will not even scratch them.
    Since ships are not creatures and are not alive, many special attacks have no effect on them.
    They also cannot gain \glossterm{conditions} from non-ship attacks by any means.
    When used against non-ship targets, weapons on Huge or larger ships have the \weapontag{Massive} tag, just like attacks from Huge or larger creatures (see \pcref{Very Large Creatures}).

\section{Ships and Gunpowder}
    In general, Rise avoids the use of guns and gunpowder.
    Those inventions do not fit into the traditional fantasy setting that Rise is built on, which emphasizes swords and bows and magic.
    For similar reasons, the ranged weapons of ships can be defined entirely with non-gunpowder weaponry common in the ancient world.
    These would include ballistas, catapults, scorpions, and similar siege weaponry.

    However, narrative tropes for ships and naval campaigns often have a more technology-heavy basis, with cannons and full broadsides.
    These stories tend to draw inspiration from the Age of Sail and Golden Age of Piracy rather than medieval folklore.
    It can feel intuitively plausible to have cannons used as ship weaponry even when guns are never used by individuals.

    The default names for ship weapons assume that gunpowder is not being used.
    If technology has advanced to the point that gunpowder weapons are possible, you can assume that hull reinforcement has also increased at the same rate.
    All the GM has to do for ship vs ship combat is change the name of the weapons to match their preferred technology level.
    More advanced weaponry is more generally effective against non-ship targets, however.
    If you use gunpowder-based ship weapons, they deal double damage against non-ship targets.
