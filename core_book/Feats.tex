\chapter{Feats}\label{Feats}

This chapter describes a set of optional rules that you can use in a campaign.
If you use these rules, characters gain feats which allow them to further specialize in specific areas, making characters more mechanically distinct from each other.
Feats also make the system more mechanically complex, so they are not necessarily enjoyable for all groups.
You cannot gain the same feat twice.

\section{Gaining Feats}
    There are two main ways you can use feats in your game.

    \parhead{Species Feat Only}
    One simple option is that characters gain a single feat at 1st level based on their species, and no other feats.
    This makes your choice of species more significant without dramatically increasing character complexity.

    \parhead{Feat Progression}
    If you want characters to be more complex and to have more powerful abilities, you can also use a feat progression system.
    For example, you could gain a feat from your species at 1st level, and an additional feat at 3rd, 6th, and 9th level.
    Alternately, you could gain feats based on the completion of major story events.
    In general, it is inadvisable to gain more than four feats total, or to gain feats after about 10th level.

    \subsection{Species Bonus Feats}\label{Species Bonus Feats}
        Each species grants a bonus feat at 1st level. Most species can only choose from a small group of feats, listed in the description of the species. A character must meet any prerequisites for these bonus feats, as normal.

        \parhead{Human} Any feat.

        \parhead{Dwarf} Any from the following list: \featref*{Blindfighter}, \featref*{Craft Specialization}, \featref*{Guardian}, \featref*{Iron Will}, \featref*{Martial Training}, \featref*{Regenerator}, \featref*{Toughness}.

        \parhead{Elf} Any Casting feat (see \pcref{Casting Feats}), or any from the following list: \featref*{Agility Specialization}, \featref*{Awareness Specialization}, \featref*{Sniper}, \featref*{Rapid Reaction}.

        \parhead{Gnome} Any Casting feat (see \pcref{Casting Feats}), or any from the following list: \featref*{Blindfighter}, \featref*{Craft Specialization}, \featref*{Stealth Specialization}, \featref*{Toughness}.

        \parhead{Half-Elf} Any Skill feat (see \pcref{Skill Feats}).

        \parhead{Half-Orc} Any Combat feat (see \pcref{Combat Feats}), or any from the following list: \featref*{Intimidate Specialization}, \featref*{Toughness}.

        \parhead{Halfling} Any from the following list: \featref*{Agility Specialization}, \featref*{Climb Specialization}, \featref*{Iron Will}, \featref*{Jump Specialization}, \featref*{Rapid Reaction}, \featref*{Stealth Specialization}.

        \subsubsection{Changing Species}
            In extraordinary cases, a creature may change its species.
            For example, the \ritual{reincarnation} ritual returns a creature to life as a different species.
            Regardless of its new species, the creature keeps its original species bonus feat.

\section{Feat Mechanics}

    \subsection{Prerequisites}
        Some feats have prerequisites.
        Unless you meet all of the prerequisites, you cannot take the feat.
        Prerequisites can include a minimum base attribute score, another feat or feats, a minimum level of training in a skill, or some other property of a character.
        A character can gain a feat at the same level at which they gain the prerequisite.

        A character who no longer meets all prerequisites for a feat loses all abilities from that feat.

    \subsection{Feat Tags}
        All feats are organized into different groups by tags.

        \parhead{General} General feats can have a wide variety of effects.
        They often grant new abilities or improve your defenses.

        \parhead{Combat} Combat feats improve your combat capabilities.
        They can increase the damage you deal, grant you new combat abilities, or improve your defenses.

        \parhead{Casting} Casting feats improve your spellcasting abilities.
        Casting feats are useless to characters who cannot cast spells.

        \parhead{Skill} Skill feats improve your skills.
        They can make you more likely to succeed with skill checks and grant you new abilities based on your skills.

        \parhead{Bloodline Feats} Some characters have traces of monstrous blood running in their veins.
        Most of those will never understand the full potential of their unusual heritage.
        Bloodline feats allow characters to explore those posibilities by gaining abilites related to their ancestry.
        You can only have one Bloodline feat.

        \parhead{Magical Feats}
        All abilities granted by feats with the Magical type are \glossterm{magical} in nature.
        Many feats are not entirely magical, but have specific effects that are magical.

\section{Feat Tables}

% Feat names must follow ``I have'' or ``I am (a)''.

    \section{Feat Descriptions}
        Each feat has a set of benefits it provides to a character with the feat.
        Some feats also have specific requirements that a character must meet before taking the feat.
        These are listed under a \textbf{Prerequisites} heading.
        If a character loses the prerequisites for a feat, they lose all benefits of the feat until they meet the prerequisites again.

        You treat its space as \glossterm{difficult terrain}.
        After moving through that creature's space, other creatures block you as normal for the remainder of your movement.
        Certain unusual creatures that occupy their entire space, such as gelatinous cubes, may be immune to this ability.

        \ff[6]{Agile Movement} Whenever you use an ability that causes you to move using one of your movement speeds in a straight line, you can make a single turn of up to 90 degrees during the movement. 
        This only affects voluntary movement, such as the \textit{charge} ability or the \textit{reaping charge} maneuver, and not forced movement imposed on you.
        This ability replaces the \textit{agile charge} ability, and cannot be combined with it (see \pcref{Agile Charge}).

        \ff[6]{Instant Stand} You can use the \textit{rapid stand} ability as a \glossterm{free action} instead of a \glossterm{minor action} (see \pcref{Rapid Stand}).

        Success means you move along the surface at half speed.
        Failure means you fall through the surface.
        The \glossterm{difficulty rating} increases by 5 for each consecutive round that you spend moving in this way.

        \ff[15]{Supreme Specialization} The bonus from your \textit{specialization} ability increases to \plus9.

        In addition, you constantly know the exact direction and distance to the target bound by your \textit{bloodbind} ability.

            Choose one \glossterm{ally} within \rngmed range.
            That ally is the target of the spell, and the spell affects that creature as if it were you instead of affecting you.

            You can only use this ability to affect one spell at a time.
            If you use it again, the original ally's attunement to the old spell is released, as the \textit{release attunement} ability (see \pcref{Attunement}).

        Under normal circumstances, removes the abilities of items that hit you with melee \glossterm{strikes}, but does not affect magical projectile weapons.

            Any act by you or by creatures that appear to be your ally that damages a target or that causes it to feel that it is in danger breaks the effect for that creature.
            An observant target may interpret overt threats to its \glossterm{allies} as a threat to itself.

            You must also make a verbal suggestion of a particular course of action to the target.
            If your suggestion does not seem reasonable, you take a \minus5 penalty to accuracy on this attack.
            Exceptionally unreasonable suggestions can impose even greater penalties, and exceptionally reasonable suggestions can give accuracy bonuses.

            \hit As a \glossterm{condition}, the target thinks your suggestion is a good idea and will try to follow it to the best of its abilities.
            Any act by you or by creatures that appear to be your ally that damages the target or makes it feel that it is in danger breaks the effect.

        You choose your actions simultaneously with any other creatures who have a similar ability.

        Knowing another creature's action does not automatically allow you to interrupt that action.

            You know exactly what direction you must travel to reach your chosen destination by the most direct physical route.
            You are not always led in the exact direction of the destination -- if there is an impassable obstacle between the target and the destination, this ability will direct you around the obstacle, rather than through it.

            The guidance provided by this ability adjusts to match whatever your current physical capabilities are, including flight and other unusual movement modes.
            It does not consider teleportation spells or any other activated abilities you may have which could allow you to bypass physical obstacles.
            It does not see into the future, and changing circumstances may cause the most direct path to change over time.
            It also does not consider hostile creatures, traps, and other passable dangers which may endanger or slow progress.
