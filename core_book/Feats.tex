\chapter{Feats}\label{Feats}

Feats are special abilities that every character has.
Feats can be used to specialize your character particular area, to grant your character new abilities, or to change the way your character does certain things.

\section{Gaining Feats}
    Your character gains two feats at 1st level, a third at 3rd level, a fourth at 6th level, and a fifth at 10th level.
    % TODO: are there any bonus fetas
    Classes can sometimes grant bonus feats as well, which are in addition to these feats which every character gets.
    A character cannot gain the same feat twice.

    \subsection{Prerequisites}
        Some feats have prerequisites.
        Unless your character has all of the prerequisites, they cannot take the feat.
        Prerequisites can include a minimum starting attribute score, another feat or feats, a minimum level of training in a skill, or some other property of a character.
        A character can gain a feat at the same level at which he or she gains the prerequisite.

        A character can't use a feat if he or she has lost a prerequisite.

\section{Feat Tags}
    All feats are organized into different groups by tags.

    \parhead{General} General feats can have a wide variety of effects.
    They often grant new abilities or improve your defenses.

    \parhead{Combat} Combat feats improve your combat capabilities.
    They can increase the damage you deal, grant you new combat abilities, or improve your defenses.

    \parhead{Spell} Spell feats improve your spellcasting abilities.
    Spell feats are useless to characters who cannot cast spells.

    \parhead{Skill} Skill feats improve your skills.
    They can make you more likely to succeed with skill checks and grant you new abilities based on your skills.

    \parhead{Bloodline Feats} Some characters have traces of monstrous blood running in their veins.
    Most of those will never understand the full potential of their unusual heritage.
    Bloodline feats allow characters to explore those posibilities by gaining abilites related to their ancestry.
    You can only have one Bloodline feat.

    \parhead{Magical Feats}
    Magical feats are \glossterm{magical} in nature.
    Many feats are not entirely magical, but have specific effects that are magical.

    \section{Feat Descriptions}
        Here is the format for feat descriptions.

    \ssecfake{Feat Name [Type of Feat]}
    \featpre Requirements a character must meet before taking the feat.
    This entry is absent if a feat has no prerequisites.
    \featben What the feat enables the character (``you'' in the feat description) to do.

        \spelldesc{You have great talent with Abjuration spells.}
        \featpre Abjuration spell known.
        \featben
        \ff{Abjurant Shield} Whenever you cast an Abjuration spell with a duration, you can give one willing creature targeted by the spell a deflective shield.
        The shielded creature gains a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{physical defenses} as long as the spell lasts.
        This is a \glossterm{magical} \glossterm{Shielding} effect.
        You can only shield one creature in this way at a time.
        If you shield another creature, all previous shields are dismissed when the new shield takes effect.

        \ff[3]{Counterspell} While you are casting a spell, at any time before it resolves, you can take an \glossterm{immediate action} to turn that spell into a counterspell.
        If you do, your spell has no effect when it resolves.
        Instead, choose a creature within \rngmed range of you.
        If that creature is casting a spell, and your maximum spell level is at least as high as their spell's level, their spell has no effect when it resolves.

        \ff[5]{Ablative Shield} The shielded creature also gains damage reduction equal to your spellpower against damage dealt by \glossterm{physical attacks}.
        % which spellpower?

        \ff[7]{Magic Against Magic} You gain a \plus2 bonus to accuracy with the \spell{antimagic} spell.
        In addition, your maximum spell level is increased by two for the purpose of determining which spells you can counter with your \textit{counterspell} ability.

        \ff[9]{Versatile Shield} The shielded creature's damage reduction applies against all damage, not just damage from physical attacks.

        \ff[11]{Pierce Shields} Your skill at creating defenses allows you penetrate defenses more easily.
        You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with magical attacks.

        \ff[13]{Punishing Counterspell} When you use your \textit{counterspell} ability, you can make the target \glossterm{miscast} their spell instead of negating the spell's effects.
        In addition, the range of your \textit{counterspell} ability increases to \rnglong.

        \ff[15]{Greater Abjurant Shield} The defense bonus granted by your \textit{abjurant shield} ability increases to \plus2.

        \ff[17]{Mass Counterspell} When you use your \textit{counterspell} ability, you may target up to five creatures.
        % Alternately, this could take control of the countered spell instead of negating it?

        Surfaces that can support at least a quarter of your weight, such as thin tree branches and dense liquids, are DR 20.
        Surfaces that can support at least a tenth of your weight, such as water, are DR 25.
        Surfaces that can support at least a hundredth of your weight, such as tree leaves, are DR 30.
        Surfaces that cannot support your weight at all, such as air, are DR 40.
        Success means you move along the surface at half speed.
        Failure means you fall through the surface.
        The DR increases by 2 for each consecutive round that you spend moving in this way.

        \ff[12]{Greater Surface Tolerance} The reduction of DR modifiers for surface conditions increases to 5.

        \ff[10]{Dual Speech}[Mag] Whenever you speak, you can make a Bluff check to speak in two voices at once.
        The base DR is 15.
        Success means you speak the same words with two different vocal patterns, such as tone or accent, though you cannot significantly change the volume.
        You can freely choose which creatures hear which pattern, treating all creatures you are not aware of as a single group.
        Failure means you choose one of the vocal patterns and speak in that pattern.
        Critical failure means the words come out garbled and incomprehensible.

        If you increase the DR by 5, your vocal patterns can be in different languages.
        If you increase the DR by 10, your vocal patterns can use entirely different words.

        \ff[12]{Greater Deceive Magic} Whenever you impersonate a creature, if your Bluff check is high enough, magical abilities treat you as if you were that creature.

        % does this work mechanically?
        For example, if you impersonate an undead creature, the \spell{inflict light wounds} spell would heal you.

        \ff[14]{Greater Quick Change} Your penalty reduction for using the \textit{disguise creature} ability of the Bluff skill increases to 10.

        If you do, you can make a Bluff check to pretend the attack affected you differently.
        The DR is equal to the result of the attack roll.
        Success means you can choose the result of the attack roll, potentially causing it to miss instead of hitting, or to hit instead of missing.
        However, you cannot make the attack get a \glossterm{critical miss}.
        After using this ability, you cannot use it again until you take a \glossterm{short rest}.

                The figment's size must be no smaller than Tiny, and no larger than Large.
                The figment does not create sound, smell, or temperature.

                During the movement phase, you can move the figment anywhere within the range, with appropriate motions to simulate natural movement.
                For example, if you created the illusion of a squad of human guards, you could cause them to walk realistically across a room.
                The figments otherwise remain motionless, except for minor motions that simulate signs of life (if appropriate).
                If the figment ever leaves this ability's range, the effect immediately ends.

                The maximum intensity of a sensation created by this ability is not enough to have any significant detrimental effects on a human experiencing the sensation.
                For example, it can create a bright light, but not so bright that it would be physically painful to view.
                % should the light be visible outside the size of the illusion? If so, how to clarify?

                When you use this ability, you make a check with a bonus equal to your spellpower \add 5.
                Creatures can recognize the figment is created by illusory magic by interacting with it physically, or by making an Awareness check against a DR equal to your check result when using this ability.

        You cannot alter the fundamental shape of the figment, but you can have it perform complex actions, such as pretending to fight other creatures or engaging in a vigorous dance.
        The figment's ability to simulate physical tasks that require dexterity or training, such as juggling, is limited by your own.
        You may need to make relevant checks to make the figment perform complex actions.

        \ff[7]{Muffled Illusions} The level cost to apply the Silent \glossterm{augment} to Illusion spells you cast is reduced by 1, to a minimum of 0 (see \pcref{Augments}).

\section{Other Feat Rules}

    % TODO: are there any abilities left that grant bonus feats?
    \subsection{Bonus Feats}
        Some abilities grant a character bonus feats.
        Unless otherwise specified, the character must still meet any prerequisites for the feat.
        If the character does not meet the prerequisites at the time the bonus feat is granted, the character does not gain the feat.
        If the character later meets the prerequisites, the character immediately gains the benefit of the bonus feat.

        If a character gains a feat as a bonus feat that he or she has already acquired through other means, the character may instead select any other feat for which she qualifies.

    \subsection{Retraining Feats}
        At every level, your character can choose to retrain an old feat in exchange for a new feat.
