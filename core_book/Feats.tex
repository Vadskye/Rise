\chapter{Feats}\label{Feats}

This chapter describes a set of optional rules that you can use in a campaign.
If you use these rules, characters gain feats which allow them to further specialize in specific areas, making characters more mechanically distinct from each other.
Feats also make the system more mechanically complex, so they are not necessarily enjoyable for all groups.

\section{Gaining Feats}
    There are two main ways you can use feats in your game.

    \parhead{Species Feat Only}
    One simple option is that characters gain a single feat at 1st level based on their species, and no other feats.
    This makes your choice of species more significant without dramatically increasing character complexity.

    \parhead{Feat Progression}
    If you want characters to be more complex and to have more powerful abilities, you can also use the feat progression system.
    With this variant, you gain a feat from your species at 1st level.
    In addition, you gain an additional feat at 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, for a total of four feats.
    You cannot gain the same feat twice.

    \subsection{Species Bonus Feats}\label{Species Bonus Feats}
        Each species grants a bonus feat at 1st level. Most species can only choose from a small group of feats, listed in the description of the species. A character must meet any prerequisites for these bonus feats, as normal.

        \parhead{Human} Any feat.

        \parhead{Dwarf} Any from the following list: \featref*{Blindfighter}, \featref*{Craft Specialization}, \featref*{Guardian}, \featref*{Iron Will}, \featref*{Martial Training}, \featref*{Regenerator}, \featref*{Toughness}.

        \parhead{Elf} Any Casting feat (see \pcref{Casting Feats}), or any from the following list: \featref*{Agility}, \featref*{Awareness Specialization}, \featref*{Sniper}.

        \parhead{Gnome} Any Casting feat (see \pcref{Casting Feats}), or any from the following list: \featref*{Blindfighter}, \featref*{Craft Specialization}, \featref*{Stealth Specialization}, \featref*{Toughness}.

        \parhead{Half-Elf} Any Skill feat (see \pcref{Skill Feats}).

        \parhead{Half-Orc} Any Combat feat (see \pcref{Combat Feats}), or any from the following list: \featref*{Intimidate Specialization}, \featref*{Toughness}.

        \parhead{Halfling} Any from the following list: \featref*{Agility}, \featref*{Climb Specialization}, \featref*{Iron Will}, \featref*{Jump Specialization}, \featref*{Stealth Specialization}.

        \subsubsection{Changing Species}
            In extraordinary cases, a creature may change its species.
            For example, the \ritual{reincarnation} ritual returns a creature to life as a different species.
            Regardless of its new species, the creature keeps its original species bonus feat.

\section{Feat Mechanics}

    \subsection{Prerequisites}
        Some feats have prerequisites.
        Unless you meet all of the prerequisites, you cannot take the feat.
        Prerequisites can include a minimum base attribute score, another feat or feats, a minimum level of training in a skill, or some other property of a character.
        A character can gain a feat at the same level at which they gain the prerequisite.

        A character who no longer meets all prerequisites for a feat loses all abilities from that feat.

    \subsection{Feat Tags}
        All feats are organized into different groups by tags.

        \parhead{General} General feats can have a wide variety of effects.
        They often grant new abilities or improve your defenses.

        \parhead{Combat} Combat feats improve your combat capabilities.
        They can increase the damage you deal, grant you new combat abilities, or improve your defenses.

        \parhead{Casting} Casting feats improve your spellcasting abilities.
        Casting feats are useless to characters who cannot cast spells.

        \parhead{Skill} Skill feats improve your skills.
        They can make you more likely to succeed with skill checks and grant you new abilities based on your skills.

        \parhead{Bloodline Feats} Some characters have traces of monstrous blood running in their veins.
        Most of those will never understand the full potential of their unusual heritage.
        Bloodline feats allow characters to explore those posibilities by gaining abilites related to their ancestry.
        You can only have one Bloodline feat.

        \parhead{Magical Feats}
        All abilities granted by feats with the Magical type are \glossterm{magical} in nature.
        Many feats are not entirely magical, but have specific effects that are magical.

\section{Feat Tables}

% Feat names must follow ``I have'' or ``I am (a)''.

    \section{Feat Descriptions}
        Each feat has a set of benefits it provides to a character with the feat.
        Some feats also have specific requirements that a character must meet before taking the feat.
        These are listed under a \textbf{Prerequisites} heading.
        If a character loses the prerequisites for a feat, they lose all benefits of the feat until they meet the prerequisites again.

    \begin{feat}{Acrobatics Specialization}{Skill}
        \featpre Acrobatics as a mastered skill.

            The spell's old target regains the \glossterm{action point} it spent to attune to the spell.

            % This has a bizarre edge case involving you being one of multiple targets for a multi-attunement effect,
            % but there is only one of those in the game and it's a ritual, so it's not worth worrying about.
            Your attunement to the other spell is released, as the \textit{release attunement} ability (see \pcref{Attunement}).
