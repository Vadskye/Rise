\chapter{Feats}\label{Feats}

This chapter describes a set of optional rules that the GM can choose to use in a campaign.
If you use these rules, characters gain feats which allow them to further specialize in specific areas, making characters more mechanically distinct from each other.
Feats also make the system more mechanically complex, so they are not necessarily enjoyable for all groups.

\section{Gaining Feats}
    There are two main ways you can use feats in your game.
    You cannot gain the same feat twice.

    \parhead{Species Feat Only}
    One simple option is that characters gain a single feat at 1st level based on their species, and no other feats.
    This makes your choice of species more significant without dramatically increasing character complexity.

    \parhead{Feat Progression}
    If you want characters to be more complex and to have more powerful abilities, you can also use a feat progression system.
    For example, you could gain a feat from your species at 1st level, and an additional feat at 3rd, 6th, and 9th level.
    Alternately, you could gain feats based on the completion of major story events.
    In general, it is inadvisable to gain more than four feats total, or to gain feats after about 10th level.

    \subsection{Species Bonus Feats}\label{Species Bonus Feats}
        If you use this rule, each species grants a bonus feat at 1st level.
        Most species can only choose from a small group of feats.
        The specific feats for each species are listed below.
        A character must meet any prerequisites for these bonus feats, as normal.

        \parhead{Human} Any feat.

        \parhead{Dwarf} Any from the following list: \featref*{Battle Armory}, \featref*{Blindfighter}, \featref*{Craft Specialization} and \featref*{Endurance Specialization}, \featref*{Iron Will}, \featref*{Martial Training}, or \featref*{Toughness}.

        \parhead{Elf} Any Casting feat (see \pcref{Casting Feats}), or any from the following list: \featref*{Awareness Specialization} and \featref*{Balance Specialization}, \featref*{Sniper}, or \featref*{Rapid Reaction}.

        \parhead{Gnome} Any Casting feat (see \pcref{Casting Feats}), or any from the following list: \featref*{Blindfighter}, \featref*{Craft Specialization} and \featref*{Stealth Specialization}, \featref*{Telepath}, or \featref*{Toughness}.

        \parhead{Half-Elf} Any Skill feat (see \pcref{Skill Feats}).

        \parhead{Half-Orc} Any Combat feat (see \pcref{Combat Feats}), or any from the following list: \featref*{Endurance Specialization} and \featref*{Intimidate Specialization}, or \featref*{Toughness}.

        \parhead{Halfling} Any from the following list: \featref*{Balance Specialization} and \featref*{Stealth Specialization}, \featref*{Climb Specialization} and \featref*{Jump Specialization}, \featref*{Iron Will}, or \featref*{Rapid Reaction}.

        \subsubsection{Uncommon Species}
            If you are using uncommon species, the feat lists for each uncommon species are given below.
            Note that uncommon species are normally ineligible for any Ancestry feats.

            \parhead{Animal Hybrid} Any feat strongly associated with the chosen animal. For example, a hybrid shark might choose from Awareness Specialization, Survival Specialization, Swiftrunner, or Swim Specialization. A hybrid wolf might choose from Awareness Specialization, Rapid Reaction, Stealth Specialization, Survival Specialization, or Swiftrunner.

            \parhead{Awakened Animal} Any feat strongly associated with the chosen animal. For example, an awakened cat might choose from Awareness Specialization, Climb Specialization, Flexibility Specialization, Rapid Reaction, Stealth Specialization, or Swiftrunner.

            \parhead{Changeling} Chameleon, or any Skill feat.

            \parhead{Dragon} Iron Will, Toughness, or any Casting feat (see \pcref{Casting Feats}).

            \parhead{Drakkenfel} Draconic Ancestry. The type of dragon chosen for the drakkenfel's \textit{draconic ancestry} must match its \textit{draconic essence}.

            \parhead{Dryaidi} Herbalist, Mental Magic, Regenerator, Sphere Focus: Toxicology, Sphere Focus: Verdamancy, or Toughness.

            \parhead{Eladrin} Boongiver, Chameleon, Combat Style Versatility, Deception Specialization and Persuasion Specialization, or Spellwarped.

            \parhead{Kit} Balance Specialization and Stealth Specialization, Deception Specialization and Social Insight Specialization, or Swiftrunner.

            \parhead{Naiadi} Boongiver, Leadership, Mental Magic, Persuasion Specialization and Swim Specialization, or Sphere Focus: Aquamancy.

            \parhead{Orc} Any Combat feat (see \pcref{Combat Feats}), or any from the following list: \featref*{Endurance Specialization} and \featref*{Intimidate Specialization}, or \featref*{Toughness}.

            \parhead{Oozeborn} Blindfighter, Chameleon, Climb Specialization and Flexibility Specialization, Juggernaut, Regenerator, Sphere Focus: Toxicology, or Toughness.

            \parhead{Tiefling} \featref*{Deception Specialization} and \featref*{Intimidate Specialization}, \featref*{Executioner}, \featref*{Spellwarped}, or \featref*{Sphere Focus: Pyromancy}.

        \subsubsection{Changing Species}
            In extraordinary cases, a creature may change its species.
            For example, the \ritual{reincarnation} ritual returns a creature to life as a different species.
            Regardless of its new species, the creature keeps its original species bonus feat.

\section{Feat Mechanics}

    \subsection{Prerequisites}
        Some feats have prerequisites.
        Unless you meet all of the prerequisites, you cannot take the feat.
        Prerequisites can include a minimum base attribute score, another feat or feats, a minimum level of training in a skill, or some other property of a character.
        A character can gain a feat at the same level at which they gain the prerequisite.

        A character who no longer meets all prerequisites for a feat loses all abilities from that feat.

    \subsection{Skill Feats}
        Skill feats are weaker and more narrow in their focus than other feats.
        Whenever a character would choose a single feat, they may instead choose two skill feats.

    \subsection{Feat Tags}
        All feats are organized into different groups by tags.

        \parhead{General} General feats can have a wide variety of effects.
        They often grant new abilities or improve your defenses.

        \parhead{Combat} Combat feats improve your combat capabilities.
        They can increase the damage you deal, grant you new combat abilities, or improve your defenses.

        \parhead{Casting} Casting feats improve your spellcasting abilities.
        Casting feats are useless to characters who cannot cast spells.

        \parhead{Skill} Skill feats improve your skills.
        They can make you more likely to succeed with skill checks and grant you new abilities based on your skills.

        \parhead{Ancestry Feats} Some characters have traces of monstrous blood running in their veins.
        Most of those will never understand the full potential of their unusual heritage.
        Ancestry feats allow characters to explore those posibilities by gaining abilites related to their ancestry.
        You can only have one Ancestry feat.

        \parhead{Magical Feats}
        All abilities granted by feats with the Magical type are \magical in nature.
        Many feats are not entirely magical, but have specific effects that are magical.

% Feat names must follow ``I have'' or ``I am (a)''.

    \section{Feat Descriptions}
        Each feat has a set of benefits it provides to a character with the feat.
        Some feats also have specific requirements that a character must meet before taking the feat.
        These are listed under a \textbf{Prerequisites} heading.
        If a character loses the prerequisites for a feat, they lose all benefits of the feat until they meet the prerequisites again.

    \begin{feat}{Awareness Specialization}{Skill}
        \featpre Awareness as a trained skill.

        \ff[1]{Specialization} You gain a \plus3 bonus to the Awareness skill.

        \ff[6]{Extraordinary Senses+} You gain one of the following senses: \trait{blindsense} (90 ft.), \trait{blindsight} (30 ft.), \trait{darkvision} (120 ft.), \trait{tremorsense} (60 ft.), or \trait{tremorsight} (30 ft.).
        As normal, if you already have the chosen sense from another source, you sum the ranges from both abilities to determine your total range with that sense.

        \ff[12]{Specialization+} The bonus from your \textit{specialization} ability increases to \plus6.

        \ff[18]{Extraordinary Senses+} You can choose an additional sense from the list given in your \textit{extraordinary senses} ability, except that the range is doubled.
        You cannot choose the same sense that you chose with your \textit{extraordinary senses} ability.
        However, you can also change the sense you chose with that ability.
    \end{feat}

    \begin{feat}{Balance Specialization}{Skill}
        \featpre Balance as a trained skill.

        \ff[1]{Specialization} You gain a \plus3 bonus to the Balance skill.

        \ff[6]{Instant Stand} You can use the \textit{rapid stand} ability as a \glossterm{free action} instead of a \glossterm{minor action} (see \pcref{Rapid Stand}).

        \ff[12]{Specialization+} The bonus from your \textit{specialization} ability increases to \plus6.

        % Modifier at 18: 3 dex + 6 spec + 9 level + 3 train = 21.
        \ff[18]{Air Dancer} You can attempt to move on surfaces that cannot support your weight, as described below.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Surfaces that can support at least a quarter of your weight, such as thin tree branches and dense liquids, are \glossterm{difficulty value} 15.
            \item Surfaces that can support at least a tenth of your weight, such as water, are \glossterm{difficulty value} 20.
            \item Surfaces that can support at least a hundredth of your weight, such as tree leaves, are \glossterm{difficulty value} 25.
            \item Surfaces that cannot support your weight at all, such as air, are \glossterm{difficulty value} 30.
        \end{itemize}

        Success means you move along the surface.
        Failure means you fall through the surface, and you cannot use this ability again during the current phase.
        The \glossterm{difficulty value} increases by 5 for each consecutive round that you spend moving in this way.
    \end{feat}

    \begin{magicalfeat}{Barbaric Ancestry}{Ancestry, Magical}
        \featpre Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution sum to at least 3
        \parhead{Special} You can only have one Ancestry feat.

        % Better than Cleave in large group fights where you have time to prebuff, worse otherwise
        \magicalff[1]{Ancestral Battlecry} You can use the \ability{ancestral battlecry} ability as a standard action.
        \begin{magicalactiveability}{Ancestral Battlecry}
            Three ghostly spirits of your ancestors appear around you.
            They cannot be attacked or interacted with.
            Whenever you make a melee \glossterm{strike}, each spirit mimics you.
            For each spirit that mimics you, the strike can affect an additional secondary target of your choice within 15 foot \glossterm{range} of you, even if you are not adjacent to it.

            At the end of each subsequent round after you use this ability, one of the spirits disappears.
        \end{magicalactiveability}

        \magicalff[6]{Ancestral Totem} You can use the \ability{ancestral totem} ability as a standard action.
        \begin{magicalsustainability}{Ancestral Totem}{\abilitytag{Manifestation}, \abilitytag{Sustain} (minor)}
            Choose an unoccupied location on solid ground within \shortrange of you.
            A Medium totem representing your ancestors appears in that location.
            The totem is a creature that cannot take actions of any kind, including \glossterm{movement}.
            Its \glossterm{hit points} and \glossterm{damage resistance} are equal to the standard value for your level (see \tref{Character Advancement and Gaining Levels}).
            Each of its defenses is equal to 5 \add half your level.

            While you are within a \medarea radius \glossterm{emanation} from the totem, you gain a \plus2 accuracy bonus with melee strikes.
        \end{magicalsustainability}

        \magicalff[12]{Ancestral Protectors} While you have ghostly spirits active from your \ability{ancestral battlecry} ability, you gain a \plus1 bonus to your Armor defense.
        In addition, you create four spirits when you use that ability rather than three.

        \magicalff[18]{Ancestral Warchief} The range of secondary strikes from your \ability{ancestral battlecry} ability increases to \shortrange.
        In addition, you can use your \ability{ancestral battlecry} and \ability{ancestral totem} abilities as a \glossterm{minor action}.
        When you use either ability as minor action in this way, you increase your \glossterm{fatigue level} by one.
    \end{magicalfeat}

    \begin{feat}{Battle Armory}{Combat}
        \featpre Strength 1, Dexterity 2.

        \ff[1]{Overburdened Quickdraw} You can draw or sheathe any weapon or shield other than a tower shield as a \glossterm{free action}.
        You can combine this with the normal ability to draw or sheathe weapons as a \glossterm{minor action}, allowing you to quickly draw or sheathe two weapons.

        \magicalff[6]{Legacy Armory} You do not choose an individual weapon as a \glossterm{legacy item} (see \pcref{Legacy Items}).
        Instead, if you choose weapons as your legacy item category, you choose magic weapon abilities that apply to all nonmagical weapons you wield.
        If you attune to a magical weapon, it keeps its own magical effects instead of your chosen legacy item properties.

        \ff[12]{Versatile Force} You gain a \plus1 bonus to your \glossterm{power} with all abilities.

        \ff[18]{Versatile Force+} The bonus from your \textit{versatile force} ability increases to \plus2.
    \end{feat}

    \begin{feat}{Blindfighter}{Combat}
        \featpre Perception 2.

        \ff[1]{Unerring} You ignore all \glossterm{miss chances}, such as from \glossterm{concealment}.
        This does not prevent your attacks from failing for other reasons.

        \ff[6]{Blindsight} You gain \trait{blindsense} with a 90 foot range, allowing you to sense your surroundings without light (see \pcref{Blindsense}).
        If you already have blindsense, the range of your blindsense increases by 90 feet.
        In addition, you gain \trait{blindsight} with a 30 foot range, allowing you to see without light (see \pcref{Blindsight}).
        If you already have blindsight, the range of your blindsight increases by 30 feet.

        \ff[12]{Unseeing Precision} You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy}.

        \ff[18]{Blindsight+} The range of your blindsense increases by 90 feet.
        In addition, the range of your blindsight increases by 150 feet.
    \end{feat}

    \begin{magicalfeat}{Blood Magic}{Casting, Magical}
        \featpre Access to a \glossterm{mystic sphere}, Constitution 2.

        \magicalff[1]{Bloodspell} Whenever you cast a spell, you may use this ability.
        When you do, you lose \glossterm{hit points} equal to your maximum spell rank.
        In exchange, you gain a \plus2 power bonus with the spell, and the spell does not require \glossterm{casting components}.

        \magicalff[6]{Bloodbind} Whenever you make a living creature lose \glossterm{hit points} using a spell, you can choose to bind the target's blood to yours.
        While the target is bound, you are always considered to have \glossterm{line of sight} to it.
        You can see it through all forms of \glossterm{concealment} and \glossterm{cover}, even if it is \trait{invisible} or fully behind a solid object.
        This binding lasts until you finish a \glossterm{long rest}.

        \magicalff[12]{Blood-Sworn Allegiance} You can swear a blood oath to your allies.
        You automatically fail any attack rolls you make against a creature that you have sworn this blood oath with.
        In addition, those creatures automatically fail any attack rolls they make against you.
        This allows you to safely use area spells that include your allies as targets, since they will suffer no ill effect from the attack.

        \magicalff[18]{Bloodbind+} You are always considered to have \glossterm{line of effect} with \magical abilities to a creature bound by your \textit{bloodbind} ability, regardless of intervening obstacles.
        This allows you to cast spells on them through solid walls.

        \magicalff[18]{Bloodspell+} The power bonus from your \textit{bloodspell} ability increases to \plus4.
    \end{magicalfeat}

    \begin{magicalfeat}{Boongiver}{Casting, Magical}
        \featpre Access to a \glossterm{mystic sphere}.

        \magicalff[1]{Share Boon} When you cast a spell with the \abilitytag{Attune} tag, you can use the \textit{share boon} ability.
        \begin{magicalactiveability}{Share Boon}
            \rankline
            The spell's \abilitytag{Attune} tag changes to \abilitytag{Attune} (target).
            Choose one \glossterm{ally} within \rngmed range.
            That ally is the target of the spell, and the spell affects that creature as if it were you instead of affecting you.

            You can only use this ability to affect one spell at a time.
            If you use it again, the original ally's attunement to the old spell ends.
        \end{magicalactiveability}

        \magicalff[6]{Sustain Attunement} Whenever you cast an \abilitytag{Attune} spell that is not a \glossterm{deep attunement}, you can choose to replace its \abilitytag{Attune} tag with the \abilitytag{Sustain (minor)} tag.

        \magicalff[12]{Versatile Boon Lore} You learn additional \glossterm{spell}.
        The spell must have the \abilitytag{Attune} tag, but you do not need to have access to the \glossterm{mystic sphere} it is from.
        The mystic sphere it is from must still be part of your \glossterm{magic source}.
        As normal, you can exchange this spell for other spells as you gain access to new spell ranks, but the spell must always have the \abilitytag{Attune} tag.

        \magicalff[18]{Share Boon+} You can use your \textit{share boon} ability on up to three different spells at once.
        If you use the ability while it already affects another spell, you choose which spells are affected by the ability.
    \end{magicalfeat}

    \begin{feat}{Brawler}{Combat}
        \featpre Strength 1, Dexterity 1.

        \ff[1]{Unarmed Warrior} You gain a \plus2 bonus to accuracy and a \plus1d bonus to damage with the punch/kick \glossterm{natural weapon} (see \tref{Natural Weapons}).
        This ability does not stack with the ability of the same name from the Perfected Form monk archetype (see \pcref{Perfected Form}).

        \ff[1]{Grapple Expertise} You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with the \textit{grapple} ability (see \pcref{Grapple}), as well as with all grapple actions (see \pcref{Grapple Actions}).

        \ff[6]{Large Grappler} You reduce your size-based penalties for being smaller than your target with the \textit{grapple} ability by 4.

        \ff[12]{Unarmed Warrior+} The damage bonus from your \textit{unarmed warrior} ability increases to \plus3d.

        \ff[12]{Grapple Expertise+} The bonus from your \textit{grapple expertise} ability increases to \plus3.

        \ff[18]{Grapple Supremacy} When you grapple a target with the \textit{grapple} ability, you do not become \grappled by that target.
    \end{feat}

        \magicalff[1]{Rebuke Evil} You can use the \textit{rebuke evil} ability as a standard action.
        \begin{magicalactiveability}{Rebuke Evil}
            \rankline
            Make an attack vs. Mental against one creature or object within \rngmed range.
            You gain a \plus2 accuracy bonus to this attack against evil creatures, and against any creature that damaged any of your \glossterm{allies} during the previous round.
            \hit \damagerankone{energy}.

            \rankline
            \featlevel{3} You gain a +1 accuracy bonus with the attack.
            \featlevel{6} The damage bonus from your \glossterm{power} increases to 1d6 per 4 power (minimum 1d6).
            \featlevel{9} The accuracy bonus increases to +2.
            \featlevel{12} The damage bonus from your power increases to 1d6 per 3 power.
            \featlevel{15} The base damage increases to 2d6.
            \featlevel{18} The damage bonus from your power increases to 1d6 per 2 power.
            % Not obviously the correct scaling
            % \featlevel{21} The base damage increases to 5d6.
        \end{magicalactiveability}

        \magicalff[6]{Healing Radiance} When you use the \textit{recover} ability, you \glossterm{briefly} emit \glossterm{brilliant illumination} in a \largearea radius \glossterm{zone} from you, and \glossterm{shadowy illumination} in twice that radius.
        % TODO: unclear scaling
        At the end of each round, each \glossterm{ally} in the radius of brilliant illumination regains \glossterm{hit points} equal to your \glossterm{power}.

        \magicalff[12]{Angel Wings} You gain feathery wings that sprout from your back.
        These wings grant you a \glossterm{fly speed} equal to the \glossterm{base speed} for your size with a maximum height of 30 feet (see \pcref{Flight}).
        As a \glossterm{free action}, you can increase your \glossterm{fatigue level} by one to ignore this height limit until the end of the round.
        The wings themselves are \glossterm{mundane}, but the ability to fly with them is \magical.

        \magicalff[18]{Angel Wings+} Your \glossterm{maneuverability} with the fly speed from your \textit{angelic flight} ability increases to perfect (see \pcref{Flying Maneuverability}).

        % TODO: unclear scaling

    \end{magicalfeat}

    \begin{feat}{Chameleon}{General}
        \featpre Disguise as a trained skill, Intelligence 2.

        \ff[1]{Adaptive Archetype} Choose one archetype that you currently have, and two archetypes you do not have from among any of your classes.
        You cannot choose an archetype that you have which is a prerequisite for another archetype that you have.
        Whenever you finish a \glossterm{long rest}, you can choose which one of those three archetypes you actually have access to.
        You gain all benefits of your chosen archetype, and temporarily lose all benefits from the archetypes you did not choose in this way.

        You must track which choices you made for archetypes that you lose access to in this way, such as which spells and maneuvers you learned.
        When you regain access to that archetype, you must make the same choices.

        \ff[6]{Adaptive Specialty} Whenever you finish a \glossterm{short rest}, you may choose an effect from the list below.
        Each effect lasts until you finish a short rest.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Martial: You become proficient with an additional \glossterm{weapon group} and an additional armor \glossterm{usage class} of your choice.

            \item Primal: You gain a \plus2 bonus to your \glossterm{fatigue tolerance}.

        \end{itemize}

        \ff[12]{Instant Adaptation} As a \glossterm{minor action}, you can change your choice of \textit{adaptive archetype} and \textit{adaptive specialty}.
        When you do, you increase your \glossterm{fatigue level} by two.

        \ff[18]{Adaptive Archetype+} Instead of choosing a single archetype to activate with your \textit{adaptive archetype}, you may choose a blend of two archetypes simultaneously.
        First, choose two archetypes to combine.
        For each rank you have access to, you choose one archetype and gain all abilities of that rank from that archetype and no abilities of that rank from the other archetype.
        You cannot choose abilities from an archetype that reference abilities from that same archetype which you do not have.
        For example, you cannot choose the \textit{wildspell+} ability unless you also have the \textit{wildspell} ability.

        \ff[18]{Adaptive Specialty+} The effects of your \textit{adaptive specialty} ability improve, as described below.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Martial: You gain a \plus1 bonus to your Armor defense.
            \item Mystic: You gain an additional \glossterm{attunement point}.

        \ff[12]{Specialization+} The bonus from your \textit{specialization} ability increases to \plus6.

    \begin{feat}{Craft Specialization}{Skill}
        \featpre Any Craft skill as a trained skill.

        \ff[1]{Specialization} You gain a \plus3 bonus to all Craft skills.

        \magicalff[6]{Craft Magic Item} You can imbue items with magic using your crafting skill.
        There are two ways to craft magic items: by sacrificing valuable raw materials or by salvaging other magic items.
        If you sacrifice valuable raw materials, you must destroy trade goods or gold pieces as if you were buying an item one rank lower than the item you are crafting  (see \pcref{Item Ranks}).
        If you salvage another magic item, you must either destroy a non-consumable magic item that is at least one rank higher than the item you are crafting, or destroy a non-consumable magic item with the exact same effect as the item you are crafting.
        As normal, you can treat five items of one rank as being equivalent to a single item of one rank higher for either of these crafting methods.

        Crafting a magic item in this way normally requires 24 hours of continuous work which may be split between any number of crafting sessions.
        You can make weaker items more quickly.
        The time required to craft magic items is halved for every rank by which your highest rank exceeds the item's rank, to a minimum of 15 minutes.

        You can also mend a broken magic item if it is one that you could make, or transfer a magical property from one item to a nonmagical item.
        If you transfer an item property in this way, the magic item ability must be valid for the new item.
        If you do so, you treat the item as if it were two ranks lower than its actual rank for the purpose of determining the cost and crafting time, to a minimum rank of 0.
        You cannot mend a \glossterm{destroyed} magic item.

        \ff[12]{Specialization+} The bonus from your \textit{specialization} ability increases to \plus6.

        \ff[18]{Item Attunement} You gain an additional \glossterm{attunement point}.

        For details, see \pcref{Command}.

        \ff[6]{Efficient Training} You can teach a creature a trick with 12 hours of work, split as you choose, rather than in a week of 4 hour sessions (see \pcref{Training Creatures}).
        In addition, you can train creatures to learn two bonus tricks beyond their normal maximum (see \pcref{Bonus Tricks}).

        \ff[12]{Specialization+} The bonus from your \textit{specialization} ability increases to \plus6.

        \ff[18]{Battleforged Companion} You can teach a creature the Battleforged Companion trick.
        This does not work on creatures that are already significantly enhanced or altered from their natural state, such as a druid's \textit{natural servant} or a ranger's \textit{animal companion}.
        The \glossterm{difficulty value} to train the trick is 20.
        A creature with the trick gains a \plus2 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} and all \glossterm{defenses}.

            You can freely choose which creatures hear which pattern, treating all creatures you are not aware of as a single group. 

            You can freely choose different vocal patterns each round that you sustain this ability.
            \rankline
            \featlevel{12} You can speak entirely different words with your two voices.
            \featlevel{18} You can also speak with a third voice, using separate words and vocal patterns.
        \end{sustainability}

        \ff[6]{Undetectable Lies} Any \magical abilities which detect lies are unable to detect lies you speak.
        This does not protect you from magical effects which control your actions, such as by compelling you to tell the truth.

        \ff[12]{Specialization+} The bonus from your \textit{specialization} ability increases to \plus6.

        \magicalff[18]{Deceive Reality} Once per \glossterm{long rest}, you can use the \ability{deceive reality} ability as a standard action.
        \begin{magicalactiveability}{Deceive Reality}
            \rankline
            You tell a lie that becomes true.
            The lie must not directly affect sentient creatures.
            The effects of the lie must be \glossterm{mundane}, so you cannot create artifacts or specific spell effects.
            You cannot affect anything beyond one mile from you, ignoring \glossterm{line of sight} and \glossterm{line of effect}.
            In addition, all effects of this ability end after ten minutes.
            However, within those limits, you can generally alter reality around you.

            Some examples of lies that would be valid to use with this ability are ``I have a bathtub full of diamonds in the other room'', ``Suddenly, all of the torches in the room were extinguished simultaneously'', and ``Don't worry, my basement cellar has always had an escape tunnel for emergencies''.

        \ff[6]{Versatile Disguise} Whenever you use the \textit{disguise creature} and \textit{emulate creature} abilities on yourself, you may simultaneously create two different disguises.
        This takes twice as long as creating a single disguise.
        You can change your appearance between the two chosen disguises as a \glossterm{minor action}.

        \ff[12]{Specialization+} The bonus from your \textit{specialization} ability increases to \plus6.

        \ff[18]{Quick Change} You can create disguises with the \textit{disguise creature}, \textit{emulate creature}, and \textit{versatile disguise} abilities as a single standard action, regardless of the complexity of the disguise.

        \ff[12]{Draconic Wings} You gain leathery wings that sprout from your back.
        These wings grant you a \glossterm{fly speed} equal to 10 feet faster than the \glossterm{base speed} for your size (see \pcref{Flight}).
        Your maximum height is 30 feet, and your \glossterm{maneuverability} with this fly speed is poor (see \pcref{Flying Maneuverability}).
        As a \glossterm{free action}, you can increase your \glossterm{fatigue level} by one to ignore this height limit until the end of the round.

            Make a melee \glossterm{strike} with a non-\weapontag{Heavy} weapon.
            This strikes only targets a single creature, even if your weapon would normally have the Sweeping tag.
            If you are the creature's only \glossterm{enemy} adjacent to it, you gain a \plus2 accuracy bonus with the strike.
            If that creature is not adjacent to any of its \glossterm{allies}, you gain an additional \plus2 accuracy bonus.

    \begin{feat}{Endurance Specialization}{Skill}
        \featpre Endurance as a trained skill.

        \ff[1]{Specialization} You gain a \plus3 bonus to the Endurance skill.

        \ff[6]{Delay Condition} Whenever you gain a \glossterm{condition}, you can make an Endurance check.
        The \glossterm{difficulty value} starts at 10 and increases by 5 in each subsequent round.
        Success means that you do not suffer the effects of the condition.
        You must repeat this check at the end of each subsequent round to continue to delay the effects of the condition.
        Failure means that the condition has its normal effect on you.

        You can only delay one of your conditions in this way.
        If you gain a new condition, you can choose to either delay the new condition or continue delaying the old condition.

        \ff[12]{Specialization+} The bonus from your \textit{specialization} ability increases to \plus6.

        It still penalizes your future \glossterm{vital rolls}.
        You can only ignore one vital wound in this way at a time.
        If you ignore a new vital wound, you suffer the full effects of the old vital wound.
    \end{feat}

    \begin{magicalfeat}{Entropist}{General, Magical}

        \magicalff[6]{Friend of Chaos} Whenever you roll to determine a random effect, such as a \glossterm{miss chance} or a sorcerer's \textit{wild magic} ability, you may roll twice and keep whichever result you prefer.
        This includes random effects for that do not explicitly tell you to roll, such as your behavior while \confused.
        However, the damage type of your \ability{sudden entropy} ability is unaffected by this ability.

        \magicalff[12]{Entropic Defense} Whenever you are hit by a \glossterm{critical hit}, there is a 50\% chance that the attack is treated as a regular hit against you instead of a critical hit.
        This is not affected by your \textit{friend of chaos} ability, since the attacker rolls this chance instead of you.

        \magicalff[18]{Master of Chaos} Whenever you roll to determine a random effect, you can use this ability.
        When you do, you increase your \glossterm{fatigue level} by two, and you may freely choose the random result.
    \end{magicalfeat}

    \begin{feat}{Executioner}{Combat}
        \featpres Perception 2.

        \ff[1]{Marked for Execution} You consider living creatures that either have a \glossterm{vital wound}, have less than their maximum \glossterm{hit points}, or have no remaining \glossterm{damage resistance} to be \textit{marked for execution}.
        Several abilities from this feat affect creatures \textit{marked for execution}.

        \magicalff[1]{Blood Sense} You gain \trait{lifesense} with a 60 foot range, allowing you to sense the location of living creatures without light (see \pcref{Lifesense}).
        Your lifesense functions like \trait{lifesight} against creatures who are \textit{marked for execution}, allowing you to see them perfectly.
        You can also automatically identify which creatures within the range of your lifesense are \textit{marked for execution}, even if you can already see them normally.

        % This ability is melee-only because it makes some of the questions around ``is this creature marked''
        % less narratively awkward since you can automatically detect them with blood sense.
        \ff[6]{Execution} You can use the \textit{execution} ability as a standard action.
        \begin{activeability}{Execution}
            \rankline
            Make a melee \glossterm{strike}.

            \featlevel{9} You gain a \plus1 accuracy bonus with the strike.

            \featlevel{18} The accuracy bonus increases to \plus3.
            % \featlevel{21} The damage increases to quadruple weapon damage.
        \end{activeability}

        \ff[12]{Purge the Weak} You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} against creatures that are \textit{marked for execution}.
        In addition, your attack rolls against creatures that are \textit{marked for execution} \glossterm{explode} on a 9 in addition to the normal explosion on a 10.
        This does not affect additional rolls with exploding dice.

        \magicalff[18]{Blood Sense+} The range of the lifesense from your \textit{blood sense} ability increases by 120 feet.
        In addition, you no longer need \glossterm{line of sight} or \glossterm{line of effect} to see creatures that are \textit{marked for execution}.
        This allows you to see them through solid objects, but grants you no special ability to attack through solid objects, so your attacks are still affected normally by \glossterm{cover}.
    \end{feat}

    \begin{feat}{Flexibility Specialization}{Skill}
        \featpre Flexibility as a trained skill.

        \magicalff[1]{Ghost Step} When you use the \textit{sprint} ability, you can become \trait{invisible} for the duration of the movement (see \pcref{Invisible}, and \pcref{Sprint}).
        This usually makes it impossible for creatures to react to your movement, such as by using the \ability{block} or \ability{follow} abilities (see \pcref{Movement Abilities}).
        This ability has the \abilitytag{Swift} tag, so it affects attacks against you during the current phase.

        \magicalff[6]{Spectral Armament} The equipment you choose as your \glossterm{legacy item} becomes ghostly and translucent (see \pcref{Legacy Items}).
        If you chose a weapon, all damage dealt with it is cold damage in addition to its other types.
        If you chose body armor or a shield, you are \trait{impervious} to cold damage.

        % as rank 3 maneuver, except for hitting Reflex defense
        \magicalff[6]{Spectral Strike} You can use the \textit{spectral strike} ability as a standard action.

            The attack is made against the target's Reflex defense instead of its Armor defense.
            You use the higher of your \glossterm{magical power} and your \glossterm{mundane power} to determine your damage with this ability (see \pcref{Power}).
            If the target takes damage and your attack result beats its Fortitude defense, it is \slowed as a \glossterm{condition}.

            \rankline
            \featlevel{9} The strike deals 1d6 \glossterm{extra damage}.

        \magicalff[12]{Ghost Step+} When you use your \textit{ghost step} ability, you can also become \trait{incorporeal} for the duration of the movement.
        This grants you the defensive benefits of being incorporeal during the current phase.

        If you chose a weapon, whenever you make a melee \glossterm{strike}, you can make the strike against each target's Reflex defense in place of its Armor defense.
        This has no effect on strikes that are not made against Armor defense.

        \featpre Strength 3.

        \ff[1]{Cleave} Whenever you make a \glossterm{melee} \glossterm{strike} with a weapon you use with two hands, it gains the Sweeping (1) tag (see \pcref{Sweeping}).
        If the weapon already has the Sweeping tag, you increase the tag's value by 1, allowing you to choose an additional secondary target.
        In addition, you can choose secondary targets within 15 feet of the primary target instead of the normal 10 feet.
        Each secondary target must still be adjacent to you unless you are using a \weapontag{Long} weapon (see \pcref{Weapon Tags}).

        \ff[6]{Power Attack} Once per round, when you make a \glossterm{melee} strike with a weapon that you use with two hands, you may take a \minus2 accuracy penalty.
        If you do, the strike deals 1d6 \glossterm{extra damage} per 4 \glossterm{power} (minimum 1d6).

        \ff[1]{Esoteric Concoction} You can use your Knowledge (nature) skill in place of Craft (alchemy) or Craft (poison) to create poisons and potions.
        This does not help you create other alchemical items, such as alchemist's fire.
        When you do, you must use esoteric natural ingredients in place of the normal ingredients.
        However, all poisons you create with this ability deteriorate and lose their effectiveness after 8 hours.

        The replacement ingredients must be difficult to acquire in large quantities and impossible to acquire in a normal city.
        For example, you can use the tail of a blind mouse or the dew from a four-leafed clover, but you could not use dirt or ordinary tree bark.
        Once you have determined a purpose for a particular replacement ingredient, you cannot use that ingredient as a replacement in any other poison or potion.

        In general, it requires an hour of work and a Knowledge (nature) check equal to 5 \add twice the rank of the item to find ingredients for an item in this way.
        Each time you find ingredients for an item this way, the time required to find ingredients again increases by an hour and the difficulty value increases by 5.
        Whenever you finish a \glossterm{long rest} or enter a different environment with different ingredients, these penalties reset.

            Whenever an \glossterm{enemy} notices the chosen object, make a \glossterm{reactive attack} vs. Mental against it.
            You are not aware of this attack, so you cannot use abilities like \ability{desperate exertion} to affect it.
            If the poison or potion is not concealed inside a less suspicious object, such as a tankard of ale or an apple, you take a \minus4 penalty to \glossterm{accuracy}.
            You cannot make this attack more than once against any individual target during this ability's duration.
            \hit The target is filled with the desire to investigate and try to consume the liquid or the object containing the liquid.
            It will not generally interrupt combat or wander into obvious danger to fulfill its desire, but individual creatures may react more or less strongly.
            This effect lasts until the target consumes the object or until it finishes a \glossterm{short rest}.

            \rankline

            If the spell has a direction, such as a cone or line, it faces directly away from you.

            You must make any attack rolls required for the spell separately from your attack roll with the strike.
            The spell takes effect even if the strike misses the target's defenses.
            However, the spell does not take effect if the strike misses or fails for some other reason, such as \glossterm{cover} or \glossterm{concealment}.

            After the spell takes effect, your attunement to this ability ends, and you \glossterm{briefly} cannot trigger any more spells you imbued this ability.
            If you fire multiple projectiles imbued with this ability at once, one of the spells takes effect and the others do not.
        \end{magicalattuneability}

        \magicalff[6]{Guided Projectiles} Your ranged \glossterm{strikes} with \weapontag{Projectile} weapons ignore all \glossterm{miss chances}, such as from \glossterm{concealment}.
        This does not prevent your attacks from failing for other reasons.

        \magicalff[12]{Imbue Projectile+} Each time you attune to your \textit{imbue projectile} ability, you can imbue two different projectiles with two different spells.
        Your attunement to the ability ends when either spell takes effect.

        \magicalff[18]{Phasing Projectiles} Your ranged \glossterm{strikes} with \weapontag{Projectile} weapons ignore \glossterm{cover}.
        In addition, you can ignore all physical obstacles in single one-foot span.
        This can allow you to fire projectiles through creatures or solid walls, though it does not grant you the ability to see through a wall.

        In exchange, you lose the benefits of all magical abilities you possess.
        You are unable to \glossterm{attune} to any magical abilities, such as magic items or spells cast by other creatures.
        You cannot use \glossterm{potions} or other similar magic items or abilities that affect you personally, even if they do not require attunement.
        In addition, you are never considered an \glossterm{ally} for a magical ability, even while \unconscious.

        % Much stronger than Spellbreaker because this is a huge part of the whole Null thing

            If the target takes damage from the strike, it stops being \glossterm{attuned} to one effect of its choice that it is currently attuned to.
            If it has any magical abilities, but has no remaining attuned effects, it becomes \stunned as a \glossterm{condition} instead.
            On a \glossterm{critical hit}, the strike deals double damage and the target stops being attuned to two abilities of its choice that it is currently attuned to.
            In addition, as a \glossterm{condition}, it stops being able to attune to abilities.

            \rankline
            You gain a \plus2 accuracy bonus with the strike for every 3 levels beyond 6.
        \end{activeability}

        Instead, you gain a \plus1 bonus to your \glossterm{accuracy}, your \glossterm{fatigue tolerance}, and all \glossterm{defenses}.
        These bonuses increase to \plus2 at level 12 and to \plus3 at level 18.

        \ff[12]{Disruptive Presence} Whenever an \glossterm{enemy} within an \medarea radius from you uses a \magical ability as a standard action, the ability has a 50\% chance to fail with no effect.
        This cannot cause passive or triggered abilities to fail.

        \ff[18]{Mundane Resilience+} The bonuses from your \textit{mundane resilience} ability increase to twice your level.

        \ff[18]{True Null} You are unaffected by all \magical abilities.

        \ff[6]{Synergistic Performance} You can use any Perform skill you have as a \glossterm{trained skill} in place of other related skills.
        Each Perform skill has an associated skill that it can be used to replace, as listed below.
        When you replace a skill in this way, you add half your modifier with the Perform skill instead of your full modifier since the two skills do not exactly match.

        \featpre Persuasion as a trained skill.

        \ff[1]{Specialization} You gain a \plus3 bonus to the Persuasion skill.

        \ff[6]{First Impressions} When you first meet creatures, you have an Ally relationship instead of a Just Met relationship (see \tref{Relationship Modifiers}.
        This does not affect your relationship with creatures who would not normally have a Just Met relationship with you.

        \ff[12]{Specialization+} The bonus from your \textit{specialization} ability increases to \plus6.

        \magicalff[18]{Suggestion} You can use the \textit{suggestion} ability as a standard action.

            Make an attack vs. Mental against a creature within \rngmed range.
            Your \glossterm{accuracy} is equal to your Persuasion skill.
            You must also make a verbal suggestion of a particular course of action to the target.
            If your suggestion does not seem reasonable, you take a \minus10 accuracy penalty on this attack.
            Exceptionally unreasonable suggestions can impose even greater penalties, and exceptionally reasonable suggestions can give accuracy bonuses.
            Whether you hit or miss, you cannot attack the target with this ability again until it finishes a \glossterm{short rest}.

            \hit As a \glossterm{condition}, the target thinks your suggestion is a good idea and will try to follow it to the best of its abilities.
            The effect ends once the target thinks it has completed the suggestion, or after ten minutes have passed.
            Any act by you or by creatures that appear to be your ally that damages the target or makes it feel that it is in danger breaks the effect.
            An observant target may interpret overt threats to its \glossterm{allies} as a threat to itself.

            That creature's intentions become obvious to you as long as you sustain this ability.
            This gives you a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} and \glossterm{defenses} against that creature.

            In addition, when you choose your action during each phase, you can do so after learning the result of the actions the target took during that phase.
            This includes learning whether its attacks hit, and any obvious effects of those attacks.
            You do not gain any knowledge of actions that have no obvious signs, such as purely mental actions, or actions which you are not observant enough to notice.
            You cannot communicate your understanding of the creature's actions to your allies before they decide their actions.
        \end{sustainability}

        \ff[12]{Mobile Foresight} During the \glossterm{movement phase}, you choose your action after all other creatures have chosen their actions.
        When you choose your action, you have insight into the actions chosen by any creatures within \longrange of you that you can see.
        This insight gives you the same information as the insight from your \textit{combat prediction} ability, except that it only provides information about their actions during the movement phase.
        You choose your actions simultaneously with any other creatures who have a similar ability.

        Knowing another creature's action does not automatically allow you to interrupt that action.
        If you want to interrupt an action, such as by blocking a creature's intended movement, you must make an \glossterm{initiative} check as normal.

        \ff[6]{Evasive Reaction} You take no damage from \glossterm{glancing blows} caused by abilities that affect an area and attack your Armor or Reflex defense.
        This does not protect you from any non-damaging effects of those abilities, or from abilities that affect multiple specific targets without affecting an area.
        If you have the \textit{evasion} monk or rogue ability with the same effect as this ability, you also gain a \plus2 bonus to your Armor and Reflex defenses against area attacks.

            All effects of that spell, including any active creatures, immediately end.
            Then, you recreate all creatures from that spell as if you had just cast it.
            Those creatures do not act until the next round.

        \magicalff[12]{Generosity} Whenever you \glossterm{attune} to an item or spell that is not a \glossterm{deep attunement}, you may use this ability.
        If you do, all creatures you create with the \sphere{Summoning} mystic sphere gain the benefit of all \glossterm{magic bonuses} from the chosen item or spell.
        It still affects you normally.
        You may only choose one attunement with this ability at a time.

        \magicalff[12]{Resummon+} You can use your \textit{resummon} ability as a \glossterm{minor action}.

        In addition, the distance you can move the object increases to 30 feet, as if you had that spell's rank 4 upgrade.

        \magicalff[6]{Telekinetic Strike} You can use the \textit{telekinetic strike} ability as a standard action.

            The strike comes from the weapon's location, not your location.
            Because this is a \magical ability, you use your \glossterm{magical power} to determine your damage instead of your \glossterm{mundane power} (see \pcref{Power}).

        \magicalff[12]{Intrinsic Telekinesis} You learn an additional spell with the \abilitytag{Attune} tag from the \sphere{Telekinesis} mystic sphere.
        The spell can be up to rank 5, even if you do not have access to rank 5 spells.
        If that spell is a \glossterm{deep attunement}, you only need to spend one \glossterm{attunement point} to attune to it.
        Otherwise, you can attune to it without spending an \glossterm{attunement point}.
        When you gain access to new spell ranks, you can change which spell you know with this ability, including spells with a higher rank.

        \magicalff[18]{Multiple Hands} When you use the \spell{distant hand} cantrip, you can create two hands instead of one.
        This can allow you to hold multiple objects simultaneously, though you must still take separate actions to manipulate those objects in any way more complicated than simple movement.
        Alternately, you can hold a single object with two hands instead of one.
        This gives you a \plus1 bonus to your Willpower for the purpose of determining your \glossterm{weight limits}, and allows you to make two-handed attacks with \weapontag{Heavy} and \weapontag{Versatile Grip} weapons using your \ability{telekinetic strike} ability.

            After you use this ability, you \glossterm{briefly} cannot use it again, whether or not it actually negated a magical effect.

            If a creature is capable of using multiple abilities during a single phase, only the first ability it uses can be countered.

        \magicalff[1]{Poisonous Blood} Whenever you become poisoned by a contact or ingestion poison, such as by drinking poison or from an enemy's attack, your body naturally repurposes the poison.
        The poison has no effect on you, but your body gains a dose of natural poison.
        This has no effect on injury-based poisons, which affect you normally without being absorbed.

        Whenever a creature makes you lose \glossterm{hit points} with a \glossterm{melee} strike using a non-Long weapon, you may have that creature become \glossterm{poisoned} by your choice of one of the poisons you store with this ability.
        This expends the dose of that poison.

        Poisons that you carry in your body with this ability automatically decay after 24 hours, regardless of the normal duration of the poison.
        You can store up to 3 doses in your body with this ability at a time.

        \magicalff[6]{Intrinsic Toxicology} You learn an additional spell with the \abilitytag{Attune} tag from the \sphere{Toxicology} mystic sphere.
        The spell can be up to rank 3, even if you do not have access to rank 3 spells.

        Otherwise, you can attune to it without spending an \glossterm{attunement point}.
        When you gain access to new spell ranks, you can change which spell you know with this ability, including spells with a higher rank.

        \magicalff[12]{Poisonous Venom} You can also inflict the poison you store with your \textit{poisonous blood} ability on other creatures with attacks.

        \magicalff[18]{Lightbane+} When you cast your \textit{suppress light} cantrip, you can choose to completely block all light in the area instead of dimming it to be \glossterm{shadowy illumination}.

        \magicalff[1]{Verdant Allies} Your speed is not reduced when moving in heavy \glossterm{undergrowth}.
        In addition, you can ignore \glossterm{cover} and \glossterm{concealment} from plants whenever doing so would be beneficial to you, as the plants move out of the way to help you.
        This prevents you from suffering a miss chance on your attacks, and also prevents creatures from using cover or concealment from plants to hide from you.

        \magicalff[6]{Residual Undergrowth} Whenever you cast a spell from the \textit{verdamancy} sphere, you may create either \glossterm{light undergrowth} or \glossterm{heavy undergrowth} in the area of the spell.
        The undergrowth persists \glossterm{briefly}.

            \hit You know the target's current thoughts and emotions.
            In addition to the obvious effects, this grants you a \plus5 bonus to Deception, Persuasion, Intimidate, and Social Insight attacks and checks against the target.
            This bonus does not stack with other effects that allow you access to the target's mind, such as \ability{read emotions}.
            You cannot directly search the target's mind for arbitrary thoughts or information.
            However, creatures often think about questions they are asked, and their thoughts may reveal much more than their words.
            \crit You can also delve through the target's mind to answer a specific question.
            You can pose a question to it mentally and search its mind to know the exact answer to that question.
            This takes five rounds of continuous concentration, and you can only get answers to one such question each time you use this ability.
