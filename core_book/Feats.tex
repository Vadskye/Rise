\chapter{Feats}\label{Feats}

Feats are special abilities that every character has.
Feats can be used to specialize your character particular area, to grant your character new abilities, or to change the way your character does certain things.

\section{Gaining Feats}
    Your character gains a feat at 1st level and every 4 levels thereafter: 1st, 5th, 9th, and so on.
    Classes can sometimes grant bonus feats as well, which are in addition to these feats which every character gets.

    \subsection{Prerequisites}
        Some feats have prerequisites.
        Your character must have the indicated attribute score, ability, feat, skill, or other quality designated in order to select or use that feat.
        A character can gain a feat at the same level at which he or she gains the prerequisite.

        A character can't use a feat if he or she has lost a prerequisite.

\section{Types Of Feats}
    All feats belong to one of four broad categories.

    \parhead{General} General feats can have a wide variety of effects.
    They often grant new abilities or improve your defenses.

    \parhead{Combat} Combat feats improve your combat capabilities.
    They can increase the damage you deal, grant you new combat abilities, or improve your defenses.

    \parhead{Spell} Spell feats improve your spellcasting abilities.
    All Spell feats except for the Ritual Caster feat are useless to characters who cannot cast spells (see \featpcref{Ritual Caster}).

    \parhead{Skill} Skill feats improve your skills.
    They can make you more likely to succeed with skill checks and grant you new abilities based on your skills.
    % generic skill feat rank requirements:
    % 1st = 4, 5th = 6, 9th = 8, 13th = 10, 17th = 12
    %    because should be able to get them 1 feat behind if trained
    % mastery feats:
    % 1st = 6, 5th = 10, 9th = 14, 13th = 18, 17th = 23
    %    because should need to have mastered the skill

    \subsection{Feat Tags}

        All feats are tagged according to their category.
        In addition, some feats have more specific tags that describe what the feat does.
        The tags are described below.

        \parhead{Bloodline Feats}

        Some characters have traces of monstrous blood running in their veins.
        Most of those will never understand the full potential of their unusual heritage.
        Bloodline feats allow characters to explore those posibilities by gaining abilites related to their ancestry.
        Each bloodline feat belongs to a specific type of monster, such as ``dragon''.

        You can only have one type of bloodline feat.
        Each type of bloodline has a single feat with ``Heritage'' in the name, which all other feats in the bloodline have as a prerequisite.

        \parhead{Magical Feats}
        Magical feats are \glossterm{magical} in nature.
        Many feats are not entirely magical, but have specific effects that are magical.
        These effects are indicated by the \magical tag.

        \parhead{Performance Feats}\label{Performance Feats}
        Performance feats allow a character to use the Perform skill to create magical effects.
        All Performance feats are also Skill feats.

        Every Performance feat grants one or more abilities which can be used by making a successful Perform check.
        Unless otherwise noted, if the Perform check fails, the ability has no effect.

        Each performance has an effect when it is used.
        Most performances continue their effects if you continue performing.

        All performance feats are \glossterm{Auditory}, \glossterm{Speech}, or \glossterm{Visual} effects, depending on the nature of the performance used to activate the feat.

        You can use any combination of performance feats you possess a number of times per day equal to half the number of ranks you have in your highest Perform skill.
        If you fail the Perform check, the use of the ability is wasted.

        \parhead{Style Feats}\label{Style Feats}
        Style feats grant a character the ability to fight or cast spells in a particular style, granting them bonuses while in that style.
        A character can only be in one style at once.
        Once per round, a character can initiate a style, change to a different style, or stop using a style as a \glossterm{free action}.

        Most style feats have requirements.
        If a style requires specific equipment, such as a melee weapon, you must meet the requirements to activate the style.
        If you fail to meet a style's requirements during a round, you leave the style at the end of the round.

        \ff[14]{Impersonation Tolerance, Greater} The reduction of DR modifiers for impersonating details you cannot replicate increases to 5.

        \ff[16]{Specialization, Greater} The bonus to Bluff increases to \plus4.

        If you do, you can make a Bluff check to pretend the attack affected you differently.
        The DR is equal to the result of the attack roll.
        Success means you can choose the result of the attack roll, potentially causing it to miss instead of hitting, or to hit instead of missing.
        However, you cannot make the attack critically fail.

        This allows you to use abilities to defend yourself, and prevents you from being \unaware.

        \ff[11]{Dual Prophecy} You may use your \textit{prophesy} ability while you have an active \textit{time of prophecy}.

    This happens before any other magic resistance effects, preventing other creatures from resisting or reflecting it.

    \featpres 5th level, 1st level spells from the chosen class.
    \featben You gain a bonus when determining your class level for the purpose of spells per day (if any), spells known, and maximum available spell level in your chosen class.
    The bonus is equal to half your class level in your chosen class.
    This cannot increase your effective class level above your character level, and does not improve the power of class abilities or grant you additional class abilities from your chosen class.

    For example, a character with 4 levels in wizard and 4 levels in fighter would have the spells per day and spells known of a 6th level wizard, and she would be able to cast 3rd level spells.
    \parhead{Special} This feat can be taken multiple times.
    Each time, you choose a different spellcasting class you possess.

    \feat{Spellcraft Mastery}{Skill}
    \featpre Spellcraft 6 ranks.
    \featben Whenever you make a Spellcraft check, you may roll twice and take the higher result.

    At 11th level, if you have 14 ranks in Spellcraft, you gain a \plus2 bonus on accuracy, checks, and defenses against spells and \glossterm{magical} effects you identify with a successful Spellcraft check.

    \feat{Spellgift}{General, Magical}
    \featpres 5 levels in classes without spellcasting, Willpower 6.
    \featben You have inherent magic in your body, granting you magical power.
    When you gain this feat, you choose a \glossterm{spell source}: arcane, divine, or nature.
    You also choose a 1st level spell from the \glossterm{spell list} for that source.
    You can spend a spellgift point to use that spell as a magical ability.
    You have a maximum number of spellgift points equal half your Willpower.
    Your spellpower with spellgifts is equal to your Willpower or your level, whichever is higher.

    At 11 levels in non-spellcasting classes, if you have 9 Willpower, you can choose a spell of up to 4th level from the same source. You can also spend a spellgift point to use that spell.

    At 15 levels in non-spellcasting classes, if you have 12 Willpower, you can choose a spell of up to 6th level from the same source. You can also spend a spellgift point to use that spell.

    \feat{Spellstrike}{Magical, Spell}
    \featpre 5th level, 2nd level spells.

    The spell must have a casting time of a standard action.
    The strike is made at the same time as other physical attacks in the action phase.
    If the strike hits a creature or object, you can spend an \glossterm{immediate action} to activate the spell.
    If you do, the target suffers the effects of the spell.

    If the strike misses, the spell is imbued into the weapon used to make the strike for 2 rounds.
    If the weapon hits a creature or object during that time, you can spend an immediate action to activate the spell, just as if the initial strike had succeeded.
    If you activate the spell, the duration runs out, or if you cast another spell, the spell in the weapon dissipates without effect.

    At 7th level, the imbuement lasts for 5 minutes before fading away.
    This can give you enough time to imbue a spell into a weapon and give the weapon to another creature.

    At 11th level, if you know 4th level spells, casting spells does not cause the imbuement to fade.
    You can still only have one spell imbued into a weapon with this feat at once.

    At 15th level, you can spend a spell slot of the spell's level to gain the benefits of this feat, rather than a spell slot one level higher than normal.

    \featpres 5th level, 1st level spells, any Performance feat.
    \featben You can cast spells while sustaining a performance, including for performance abilities (see \pcref{Performance Feats}).
    This does not remove the need for verbal and somatic components, though you may attempt to incorporate those into your performance (see \pcref{Components}).
    The Spellcraft DR to identify those spells as they are cast increases by 10, as the performance disguises the magic.

    At 7th level, you can spend a spell slot to use a performance ability in place of a use of your performance abilities.

    At 11th level, you can spend a use of your performance abilities in place of a spell slot.
    The spell slot must be of a spell level you have access to, and its level cannot exceed half your Perform ranks.

    \featpre Stealth 6 ranks.
    \featben Whenever you make a Stealth check, you may roll twice and take the higher result.

    At 3rd level, your penalties for moving while hiding are reduced by 5.
    This means you can move at up to half speed with no penalty, and you can move at full speed with a \minus5 penalty.

    This allows you to use a single \glossterm{free action} to initiate two styles at once, or change which two styles you are using.
    You may only do this for a number of rounds per day equal to your Intelligence.

    At 15th level, if you have 12 Intelligence, there is no limit on the number of rounds you can use this feat each day.

    \feat{Supreme Inspiration}{Magical, Performance, Skill}
    \featpres 9th level, Perform 9 ranks.
    \featben You can create performances with staggering inspirational power, starting with the ability to inspire serenity.
    You can use any combination of performance abilities a number of times per day equal to half the ranks you have in your highest Perform skill.

    \parhead{Inspire Serenity} As a standard action, you can make a DR 20 Perform check to clear the mind of a willing creature within \rngmed range of you.
    The target is immune to all hostile \glossterm{Mind} effects as long as you sustain the performance.
    This is a Mind effect.

    At 15th level, you learn how to inspire mastery.
    \parhead{Inspire Mastery} As a standard action, you can make a DR 22 Perform check to inspire mastery in another willing creature within \rngmed range of you.
    As long as you sustain the performance, at the start of each round, the target gains a bonus general \glossterm{legend point} which it can spend during that round.
    If the target's legend point has not yet been used when the round ends, it is wasted.

    At 19th level, you can affect a number of creatures with \textit{inspire serenity} equal to one fifth of your Perform check result.
    In addition, you learn how to inspire perfection.
    \parhead{Inspire Perfection} As a standard action, you can make a DR 34 Perform check to inspire perfection in another willing creature within \rngmed range of you.
    Once during the performance's duration, the target can spend a general legend point to treat any attack or check it attempts as if it had rolled a 20, ignoring its actual roll.
    This decision is made in the same way as the creature would spend a normal legend point.
    This performance is extraordinarily draining, and you can only perform it once per day.

    \feat{Survival Mastery}{Skill}
    \featpre Survival 6 ranks.
    \featben Whenever you make a Survival check, you may roll twice and take the higher result.

    Of course, it can change its plans, particularly if it hears you tell your allies what it will do.

    At 11th level, if you have 9 Intelligence, you gain a \plus2 bonus to this attack per round you have seen the creature fight.

\section{Other Feat Rules}

    \subsection{Bonus Feats}
        Some abilities grant a character bonus feats.
        Unless otherwise specified, the character must still meet any prerequisites for the feat.
        If the character does not meet the prerequisites at the time the bonus feat is granted, the character does not gain the feat.
        If the character later meets the prerequisites, the character immediately gains the benefit of the bonus feat.

        If a character gains a feat as a bonus feat that he or she has already acquired through other means, the character may select instead any other feat for which she qualifies.

    \subsection{Retraining Feats}
        At every level, your character can choose to retrain an old feat in exchange for a new feat.
        You can only retrain feats for other feats you could have acquired at the time you took the original feat.
        For example, a 6th level fighter can retrain his 2nd level fighter bonus feat for any other combat feat that he qualified for at his 2nd fighter level.
        This also means you cannot retrain feats gained through class abilities which give you a specific feat, since there were no other feats you could have taken.
