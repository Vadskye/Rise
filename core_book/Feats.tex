\chapter{Feats}\label{Feats}

Feats are special abilities that every character has.
Feats can be used to specialize your character particular area, to grant your character new abilities, or to change the way your character does certain things.

\section{Gaining Feats}
    Your character gains two feats at 1st level, a third at 3rd level, a fourth at 6th level, and a fifth at 10th level.
    % TODO: are there any bonus fetas
    Classes can sometimes grant bonus feats as well, which are in addition to these feats which every character gets.
    A character cannot gain the same feat twice.

    \subsection{Prerequisites}
        Some feats have prerequisites.
        Unless your character has all of the prerequisites, they cannot take the feat.
        Prerequisites can include a minimum starting attribute score, another feat or feats, a minimum level of training in a skill, or some other property of a character.
        A character can gain a feat at the same level at which he or she gains the prerequisite.

        A character can't use a feat if he or she has lost a prerequisite.

\section{Feat Tags}
    All feats are organized into different groups by tags.

    \parhead{General} General feats can have a wide variety of effects.
    They often grant new abilities or improve your defenses.

    \parhead{Combat} Combat feats improve your combat capabilities.
    They can increase the damage you deal, grant you new combat abilities, or improve your defenses.

    \parhead{Spell} Spell feats improve your spellcasting abilities.
    Spell feats are useless to characters who cannot cast spells.

    \parhead{Skill} Skill feats improve your skills.
    They can make you more likely to succeed with skill checks and grant you new abilities based on your skills.

    \parhead{Bloodline Feats} Some characters have traces of monstrous blood running in their veins.
    Most of those will never understand the full potential of their unusual heritage.
    Bloodline feats allow characters to explore those posibilities by gaining abilites related to their ancestry.
    You can only have one Bloodline feat.

    \parhead{Magical Feats}
    All abilities granted by feats with the [Magical] type are \glossterm{magical} in nature.
    Many feats are not entirely magical, but have specific effects that are magical.

\section{Feat Tables}

            As a \glossterm{standard action}, you can spend an \glossterm{action point} to use this ability.
            To do so, you must visualize an action that a creature (or group of creatures) could take within the next hour.
            This time period is called the \textit{time of prophecy}.

            When you use this ability, you see a brief, cryptic vision describing the most likely outcome of the action you visualized.
            This vision does not reveal any consequences that might occur after the \textit{time of prophecy} has ended.
            The vision does not have to be a literally accurate representation of the future.
            For example, if you used this ability to foresee the results of entering a room that had a group of creatures waiting in ambush, you might see a vision of flashing daggers in darkness darting towards your exposed back, regardless of whether the creatures would actually use daggers to attack.

        \ff[11]{Dual Prophecy} You may use your \textit{prophesy} ability while you have an active \textit{time of prophecy}.

        \ff[1]{Create Image} You gain the \textit{create image} ability.
        \begin{ability}{Create Image}[\glossterm{Figment}, \glossterm{Sustain} (minor)]
            As a standard action, you can spend an \glossterm{action point} to use this ability.
            If you do, you create a visual illusion of an object, creature, or force within \rngmed range.
            The figment's size must be no smaller than Tiny, and no larger than Large.
            The figment does not create sound, smell, or temperature.

            During the movement phase, you can move the figment anywhere within the range, with appropriate motions to simulate natural movement.
            For example, if you created the illusion of a squad of human guards, you could cause them to walk realistically across a room.
            The figments otherwise remain motionless, except for minor motions that simulate signs of life (if appropriate).
            If the figment ever leaves this ability's range, the effect immediately ends.

            The maximum intensity of a sensation created by this ability is not enough to have any significant detrimental effects on a human experiencing the sensation.
            For example, it can create a bright light, but not so bright that it would be physically painful to view.
            % should the light be visible outside the size of the illusion? If so, how to clarify?

            When you use this ability, you make a check with a bonus equal to your spellpower \add 5.
            Creatures can recognize the figment is created by illusory magic by interacting with it physically, or by making an Awareness check against a DR equal to your check result when using this ability.

            If you do, you can directly control the figment's movement for the rest of the round.
            You cannot alter the fundamental shape of the figment, but you can have it perform complex actions, such as pretending to fight other creatures or dancing.
            The figment's ability to simulate physical tasks that require dexterity or training, such as juggling, is limited by your own.
            You may need to make relevant checks to make the figment perform complex actions.
