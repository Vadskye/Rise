\chapter{Feats}\label{Feats}

This chapter describes a set of optional rules that the GM can choose to use in a campaign.
If you use these rules, characters gain feats which allow them to further specialize in specific areas, making characters more mechanically distinct from each other.
Feats also make the system more mechanically complex, so they are not necessarily enjoyable for all groups.

\section{Gaining Feats}
    There are two main ways you can use feats in your game.
    You cannot gain the same feat twice.

    \parhead{Species Feat Only}
    One simple option is that characters gain a single feat at 1st level based on their species, and no other feats.
    This makes your choice of species more significant without dramatically increasing character complexity.

    \parhead{Feat Progression}
    If you want characters to be more complex and to have more powerful abilities, you can also use a feat progression system.
    For example, you could gain a feat from your species at 1st level, and an additional feat at 3rd, 6th, and 9th level.
    Alternately, you could gain feats based on the completion of major story events.
    In general, it is inadvisable to gain more than four feats total, or to gain feats after about 10th level.

    \subsection{Species Bonus Feats}\label{Species Bonus Feats}
        If you use this rule, each species grants a bonus feat at 1st level.
        Most species can only choose from a small group of feats.
        The specific feats for each species are listed below.
        A character must meet any prerequisites for these bonus feats, as normal.

        \parhead{Human} Any feat.

        \parhead{Dwarf} Any from the following list: \featref*{Battle Armory}, \featref*{Blindfighter}, \featref*{Craft Specialization} and \featref*{Endurance Specialization}, \featref*{Iron Will}, \featref*{Martial Training}, or \featref*{Toughness}.

        \parhead{Elf} Any Casting feat (see \pcref{Casting Feats}), or any from the following list: \featref*{Awareness Specialization} and \featref*{Balance Specialization}, \featref*{Sniper}, or \featref*{Rapid Reaction}.

        \parhead{Gnome} Any Casting feat (see \pcref{Casting Feats}), or any from the following list: \featref*{Blindfighter}, \featref*{Craft Specialization} and \featref*{Stealth Specialization}, \featref*{Telepath}, or \featref*{Toughness}.

        \parhead{Half-Elf} Any Skill feat (see \pcref{Skill Feats}).

        \parhead{Half-Orc} Any Combat feat (see \pcref{Combat Feats}), or any from the following list: \featref*{Endurance Specialization} and \featref*{Intimidate Specialization}, or \featref*{Toughness}.

        \parhead{Halfling} Any from the following list: \featref*{Balance Specialization} and \featref*{Stealth Specialization}, \featref*{Climb Specialization} and \featref*{Jump Specialization}, \featref*{Iron Will}, or \featref*{Rapid Reaction}.

        \subsubsection{Uncommon Species}
            If you are using uncommon species, the feat lists for each uncommon species are given below.
            Note that uncommon species are normally ineligible for any Bloodline feats.

            \parhead{Animal Hybrid} Any feat strongly associated with the chosen animal. For example, a hybrid shark might choose from Awareness Specialization, Survival Specialization, Swiftrunner, or Swim Specialization. A hybrid wolf might choose from Awareness Specialization, Rapid Reaction, Stealth Specialization, Survival Specialization, or Swiftrunner.

            \parhead{Awakened Animal} Any feat strongly associated with the chosen animal. For example, an awakened cat might choose from Awareness Specialization, Climb Specialization, Flexibility Specialization, Rapid Reaction, Stealth Specialization, or Swiftrunner.

            \parhead{Changeling} Chameleon, or any Skill feat.

            \parhead{Dragon} Iron Will, Toughness, or any Casting feat (see \pcref{Casting Feats}).

            \parhead{Drakkenfel} Draconic Heritage. The type of dragon chosen for the drakkenfel's \textit{draconic ancestry} must match its \textit{draconic essence}.

            \parhead{Dryaidi} Herbalist, Mental Magic, Regenerator, Sphere Focus: Toxicology, Sphere Focus: Verdamancy, or Toughness.

            \parhead{Eladrin} Boongiver, Chameleon, Combat Style Versatility, Deception Specialization and Persuasion Specialization, or Spellwarped.

            \parhead{Kit} Balance Specialization and Stealth Specialization, Deception Specialization and Social Insight Specialization, or Swiftrunner.

            \parhead{Naiadi} Boongiver, Leadership, Mental Magic, Persuasion Specialization and Swim Specialization, or Sphere Focus: Aquamancy.

            \parhead{Orc} Any Combat feat (see \pcref{Combat Feats}), or any from the following list: \featref*{Endurance Specialization} and \featref*{Intimidate Specialization}, or \featref*{Toughness}.

            \parhead{Oozeborn} Blindfighter, Chameleon, Climb Specialization and Flexibility Specialization, Juggernaut, Regenerator, Sphere Focus: Toxicology, or Toughness.

            \parhead{Tiefling} \featref*{Deception Specialization} and \featref*{Intimidate Specialization}, \featref*{Executioner}, \featref*{Spellwarped}, or \featref*{Sphere Focus: Pyromancy}.

        \subsubsection{Changing Species}
            In extraordinary cases, a creature may change its species.
            For example, the \ritual{reincarnation} ritual returns a creature to life as a different species.
            Regardless of its new species, the creature keeps its original species bonus feat.

\section{Feat Mechanics}

    \subsection{Prerequisites}
        Some feats have prerequisites.
        Unless you meet all of the prerequisites, you cannot take the feat.
        Prerequisites can include a minimum base attribute score, another feat or feats, a minimum level of training in a skill, or some other property of a character.
        A character can gain a feat at the same level at which they gain the prerequisite.

        A character who no longer meets all prerequisites for a feat loses all abilities from that feat.

    \subsection{Skill Feats}
        Skill feats are weaker and more narrow in their focus than other feats.
        Whenever a character would choose a single feat, they may instead choose two skill feats.

    \subsection{Feat Tags}
        All feats are organized into different groups by tags.

        \parhead{General} General feats can have a wide variety of effects.
        They often grant new abilities or improve your defenses.

        \parhead{Combat} Combat feats improve your combat capabilities.
        They can increase the damage you deal, grant you new combat abilities, or improve your defenses.

        \parhead{Casting} Casting feats improve your spellcasting abilities.
        Casting feats are useless to characters who cannot cast spells.

        \parhead{Skill} Skill feats improve your skills.
        They can make you more likely to succeed with skill checks and grant you new abilities based on your skills.

        \parhead{Bloodline Feats} Some characters have traces of monstrous blood running in their veins.
        Most of those will never understand the full potential of their unusual heritage.
        Bloodline feats allow characters to explore those posibilities by gaining abilites related to their ancestry.
        You can only have one Bloodline feat.

        \parhead{Magical Feats}
        All abilities granted by feats with the Magical type are \magical in nature.
        Many feats are not entirely magical, but have specific effects that are magical.

% Feat names must follow ``I have'' or ``I am (a)''.

    \section{Feat Descriptions}
        Each feat has a set of benefits it provides to a character with the feat.
        Some feats also have specific requirements that a character must meet before taking the feat.
        These are listed under a \textbf{Prerequisites} heading.
        If a character loses the prerequisites for a feat, they lose all benefits of the feat until they meet the prerequisites again.

    \begin{feat}{Awareness Specialization}{Skill}
        \featpre Awareness as a trained skill.

        \ff[1]{Specialization} You gain a \plus3 bonus to the Awareness skill.

        \ff[3]{Extraordinary Senses} You gain one of the following senses: \trait{blindsense} (30 ft.), \trait{darkvision} (60 ft.), \trait{low-light vision}, \trait{scent}, or \trait{tremorsense} (30 ft.).
        As normal, if you already have the chosen sense from another source, you sum the ranges from both abilities to determine your total range with that sense.

        \ff[9]{Extraordinary Senses+} You gain one of the following senses: \trait{blindsense} (120 ft.), \trait{blindsight} (30 ft.), \trait{darkvision} (240 ft.), \trait{tremorsense} (120 ft.), or \trait{tremorsight} (30 ft.).
        You cannot choose the same sense that you chose with your \textit{extraordinary senses} ability.
        However, you can also change the sense you chose with that ability.

        \ff[15]{Specialization+} The bonus from your \textit{specialization} ability increases to \plus6.

        \ff[21]{Extraordinary Senses+} You can choose an additional sense from the list given in your \textit{greater extraordinary senses} ability, except that the range is doubled.
        You cannot choose the same sense that you chose with your \textit{extraordinary senses} or \textit{greater extraordinary senses} abilities.
        However, you can also change the sense you chose with those abilities.
    \end{feat}

    \begin{feat}{Balance Specialization}{Skill}
        \featpre Balance as a trained skill.

        \ff[1]{Specialization} You gain a \plus3 bonus to the Balance skill.

        \ff[3]{Instant Stand} You can use the \textit{rapid stand} ability as a \glossterm{free action} instead of a \glossterm{minor action} (see \pcref{Rapid Stand}).

        \ff[9]{Specialization+} The bonus from your \textit{specialization} ability increases to \plus6.

         % modifier at 10th: 12dex + 2mst + 2ft = 16
        \magicalff[15]{Air Dancer} You can attempt to move on surfaces that cannot support your weight, as described below.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Surfaces that can support at least a quarter of your weight, such as thin tree branches and dense liquids, are \glossterm{difficulty value} 20.
            \item Surfaces that can support at least a tenth of your weight, such as water, are \glossterm{difficulty value} 25.
            \item Surfaces that can support at least a hundredth of your weight, such as tree leaves, are \glossterm{difficulty value} 30.
            \item Surfaces that cannot support your weight at all, such as air, are \glossterm{difficulty value} 40.
        \end{itemize}

        Success means you move along the surface at half speed.
        Failure means you fall through the surface.
        The \glossterm{difficulty value} increases by 5 for each consecutive round that you spend moving in this way.

        \ff[21]{Balance On Air+} You can move at full speed while using your \textit{air dancer} ability.
        In addition, for each round that you spend using your \textit{air dancer} ability, the \glossterm{difficulty value} increases by 2 instead of by 5.
    \end{feat}

    \begin{feat}{Battle Armory}{Combat}
        \featpre Strength 1, Dexterity 2.

        \ff[1]{Overburdened Quickdraw} You can draw or sheathe any weapon or shield other than a tower shield as a \glossterm{free action}.

        \magicalff[3]{Legacy Armory} You do not choose an individual item as a \glossterm{legacy item} (see \pcref{Legacy Items}).
        Instead, if you choose weapons as your legacy item category, you choose magic weapon abilities that apply to all nonmagical weapons you wield.
        If you wield a magical weapon, it keeps its own magical effects instead of your chosen legacy item properties.

        \ff[9]{Versatile Force} You gain a \plus3 bonus to your \glossterm{power}.

        \ff[15]{Versatile Force+} The bonus from your \textit{versatile force} ability increases to \plus6.

        \ff[21]{Surprising Quickdraw} When you make a \glossterm{strike} with a weapon against a creature, if you drew that weapon in the same phase that you made the strike and did not wield any weapons at the start of that phase, you can use this ability.
        If you do, the creature is \unaware of the attack.
        After you use this ability, the attacked creature and all creatures that observed the attack are immune to this ability until they take a \glossterm{short rest}.
    \end{feat}

    \begin{feat}{Blindfighter}{Combat}
        \featpre Perception 2.

        \ff[1]{Unerring} You ignore all \glossterm{miss chances}, such as from \glossterm{concealment}.
        This does not prevent your attacks from failing for other reasons.

        \ff[3]{Blindsight} You gain \trait{blindsense} with a 90 foot range, allowing you to sense your surroundings without light (see \pcref{Blindsense}).
        If you already have blindsense, the range of your blindsense increases by 90 feet.
        In addition, you gain \trait{blindsight} with a 30 foot range, allowing you to see without light (see \pcref{Blindsight}).
        If you already have blindsight, the range of your blindsight increases by 30 feet.

        \ff[9]{Unseeing Precision} You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy}.

        \featpre Access to a \glossterm{mystic sphere}, Constitution 2.

        \ff[1]{Bloodspell} Whenever you cast a spell, you may use this ability.
        When you do, you lose \glossterm{hit points} equal to your maximum spell rank.
        In exchange, you gain a power bonus with the spell equal to the hit points you lost this way, and the spell does not require \glossterm{casting components}.

        \ff[3]{Bloodbind} Whenever you make a living creature lose \glossterm{hit points} using a spell, you can choose to bind the target's blood to yours.
        While the target is bound, you can see it through all forms of \glossterm{concealment} and \glossterm{cover}, even if it is \trait{invisible}.
        This binding lasts until you bind another creature with this ability, or until you take a \glossterm{long rest}.

        \ff[9]{Blood-Sworn Allegiance} You can swear a blood oath to your allies.
        You automatically fail any attack rolls you make against a creature that you have sworn this blood oath with.
        In addition, those creatures automatically fail any attack rolls they make against you.
        This allows you to safely use area spells that include your allies as targets, since they will suffer no ill effect from the attack.

        \ff[15]{Bloodbind+} You are always considered to have \glossterm{line of effect} with \magical abilities to a creature bound by your \textit{bloodbind} ability, regardless of intervening obstacles.
        This allows you to cast spells on them through solid walls.
        In addition, you can bind any number of creatures at once with your \textit{bloodbind} ability.

        \ff[21]{Bloodspell+} You can choose to lose 10 hit points when you use your \textit{bloodspell} ability.
        If you do, the power bonus increases to \plus10.
    \end{magicalfeat}

    \begin{magicalfeat}{Boongiver}{Casting, Magical}
        \featpre Access to a \glossterm{mystic sphere}.

        \ff[1]{Share Boon} When you cast a spell with the \abilitytag{Attune} tag, you can use the \textit{share boon} ability.
        \begin{magicalactiveability}{Share Boon}
            \rankline
            The spell's \abilitytag{Attune} tag changes to \abilitytag{Attune} (target).
            Choose one \glossterm{ally} within \rngmed range.
            That ally is the target of the spell, and the spell affects that creature as if it were you instead of affecting you.

            You can only use this ability to affect one spell at a time.
            If you use it again, the original ally's attunement to the old spell is released, as the \textit{release attunement} ability (see \pcref{Attuned Abilities}).
        \end{magicalactiveability}

        \ff[3]{Sustain Attunement} Whenever you cast an \abilitytag{Attune} (target) spell that is not a \glossterm{deep attunement}, you can choose to replace its \abilitytag{Attune} tag with the \abilitytag{Sustain (minor)} tag.

        \ff[9]{Versatile Boon Lore} You learn additional \glossterm{spell}.
        The spell must have the \abilitytag{Attune} tag, but you do not need to have access to the \glossterm{mystic sphere} it is from.
        The mystic sphere it is from must still be part of your \glossterm{magic source}.
        As normal, you can exchange this spell for other spells as you gain access to new spell ranks, but the spell must always have the \abilitytag{Attune} tag.

        \ff[15]{Personal Boon} You gain an additional \glossterm{attunement point}.
        You can only use this attunement point to \glossterm{attune} to spells and rituals that you use on yourself.

        \ff[21]{Share Boon+} You can use your \textit{share boon} ability on up to three different spells at once.
        If you use the ability while it already affects another spell, you choose which spells are affected by the ability.
    \end{magicalfeat}

    \begin{feat}{Brawler}{Combat}
        \featpre Strength 1, Dexterity 1.

        \ff[1]{Unarmed Warrior} You gain a \plus2 bonus to accuracy and a \plus1d bonus to damage with the punch/kick \glossterm{natural weapon} (see \pcref{Natural Weapons}).
        This ability does not stack with the ability of the same name from the Perfected Form monk archetype (see \pcref{Perfected Form}).

        \ff[1]{Grapple Expertise} You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with the \textit{grapple} ability (see \pcref{Grapple}), as well as with all grapple actions (see \pcref{Grapple Actions}).

        \ff[3]{Takedown} Whenever you hit a target with the \textit{grapple} ability, the target also takes damage as if you had hit with your unarmed attack or a light \glossterm{natural weapon} you wield.

        \ff[9]{Large Grappler} You reduce your size-based penalties for being smaller than your target with the \textit{grapple} ability by 4.

    \end{feat}

    \begin{magicalfeat}{Celestial Heritage}{Bloodline, Magical}
        \featpre Non-evil alignment.
        \parhead{Special} You can only have one Bloodline feat.

        \ff[1]{Rebuke Evil} You can use the \textit{rebuke evil} ability as a standard action.

            \rankline
            Make an attack vs. Mental against one creature or object within \rngmed range.
            You gain a \plus2 accuracy bonus to this attack against any creature that damaged any of your \glossterm{allies} during the previous round.
            If the target has the alignment opposed to your devoted alignment, you double all of your damage bonuses along with your damage dice when you get a \glossterm{critical hit}.
            \hit The target takes 1d8 \add \glossterm{power} energy damage.

            \rankline
            You gain a \plus1 accuracy bonus and a \plus1d damage bonus at 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter.
        \end{magicalactiveability}

        \ff[3]{Healing Light} When you use the \textit{recover} ability, you \glossterm{briefly} emit \glossterm{brilliant illumination} in a \medarea radius \glossterm{zone} from you, and \glossterm{shadowy illumination} in twice that radius.
        At the end of each round, each \glossterm{ally} in the radius of brilliant illumination regains \glossterm{hit points} equal to your \glossterm{power}.

        \ff[9]{Angel Wings} You gain feathery wings that sprout from your back.
        These wings grant you a \glossterm{fly speed} equal to the \glossterm{base speed} for your size with a maximum height of 30 feet (see \pcref{Flight}).
        As a \glossterm{free action}, you can increase your \glossterm{fatigue level} by one to ignore this height limit until the end of the round.
        The wings themselves are \glossterm{mundane}, but the ability to fly with them is \magical.

        \ff[15]{Healing Light+} The healing provided by your \textit{healing light} ability increases to twice your power.
        In addition, the radius of brilliant illumination increases to a \hugearea radius.

        \ff[21]{Angel Wings+} Your \glossterm{maneuverability} with the fly speed from your \textit{angelic flight} ability increases to perfect (see \pcref{Flying Maneuverability}).
    \end{magicalfeat}

        \featpre Disguise as a trained skill, Intelligence 2.

        You cannot choose an archetype that you have which is a prerequisite for another archetype that you have.
        Whenever you finish a \glossterm{long rest}, you can choose which one of those three archetypes you actually have access to.
        You gain all benefits of your chosen archetype, and temporarily lose all benefits from the archetypes you did not choose in this way.

        You must track which choices you made for archetypes that you lose access to in this way, such as which spells and maneuvers you learned.
        When you regain access to that archetype, you must make the same choices.

        \ff[3]{Adaptive Specialty} Whenever you finish a \glossterm{short rest}, you may choose an effect from the list below.
        Each effect lasts until you take a short rest.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Martial: You become proficient with an additional \glossterm{weapon group} and an additional armor \glossterm{usage class} of your choice.
                You must be proficient with light armor to become proficient with medium armor, and you must be proficient with medium armor to become proficient with heavy armor.
            \item Mystic: You gain a \plus2 bonus to your Mental defense.
            \item Primal: You gain a \plus2 bonus to your \glossterm{fatigue tolerance}.
            \item Skilled: You gain a \plus1 bonus to all skills.
        \end{itemize}

        \ff[9]{Instant Adaptation} As a \glossterm{minor action}, you can change your choice of \textit{adaptive archetype} and \textit{adaptive specialty}.

            \item Skilled: The skill bonus increases to \plus2.
        \end{itemize}

        First, choose two archetypes to combine.
        For each rank you have access to, you choose one archetype and gain all abilities of that rank from that archetype and no abilities of that rank from the other archetype.
        You cannot choose abilities from an archetype that reference abilities from that same archetype which you do not have.
        For example, you cannot choose the \textit{supreme wildspell} ability unless you also have the \textit{wildspell} ability.
    \end{feat}

    \begin{feat}{Climb Specialization}{Skill}
        \featpre Climb as a trained skill.

        \ff[3]{Climb Speed} You gain a \glossterm{climb speed} 10 feet slower than the \glossterm{base speed} for your size.
        If you already have a climb speed, you gain a \plus10 foot bonus to your climb speed.
        A successful Climb check to move allows you to travel a distance equal to your climb speed.

        \ff[9]{Creature Climber} You can use the \textit{creature climb} ability against creatures one or more size categories larger than you instead of two (see \pcref{Creature Climb}).
        This does not cause you or the creature to suffer penalties for \squeezing.

        \ff[15]{Specialization+} The bonus from your \textit{specialization} ability increases to \plus6.

        \ff[21]{Freehand Climb} You only need one \glossterm{free hand} to move while climbing.

        \featpre Any Craft skill as a trained skill.

        \ff[1]{Specialization} You gain a \plus3 bonus to all Craft skills.

        \magicalff[3]{Craft Magic Item} You can imbue items with magic using your crafting skill.
        There are two ways to craft magic items: by sacrificing valuable raw materials or by salvaging other magic items.
        If you sacrifice valuable raw materials, you must destroy trade goods or gold pieces as if you were buying an item one rank lower than the item you are crafting  (see \pcref{Item Ranks}).
        If you salvage another magic item, you must either destroy a non-consumable magic item that is at least one rank higher than the item you are crafting, or destroy a non-consumable magic item with the exact same effect as the item you are crafting.
        As normal, you can treat five items of one rank as being equivalent to a single item of one rank higher for either of these crafting methods.

        Crafting a magic item in this way normally requires 24 hours of continuous work which may be split between any number of crafting sessions.
        You can make weaker items more quickly.
        The time required to craft magic items is halved for every rank by which your highest rank exceeds the item's rank, to a minimum of 15 minutes.

        You can also mend a broken magic item if it is one that you could make, or transfer a magical property from one item to a nonmagical item.
        If you transfer an item property in this way, the magic item ability must be valid for the new item.
        If you do so, you treat the item as if it were two ranks lower than its actual rank for the purpose of determining the cost and crafting time, to a minimum rank of 0.
        You cannot mend a \glossterm{destroyed} magic item.

        \ff[9]{Knowledge Savant} You gain two additional \glossterm{trained skills} which must be Craft skills.

        \ff[15]{Specialization+} The bonus from your \textit{specialization} ability increases to \plus6.

        \ff[21]{Item Attunement} You gain an additional \glossterm{attunement point}.
        You can only use this \glossterm{attunement point} to \glossterm{attune} to the effects of items (see \pcref{Item Attunement}).
    \end{feat}

    \begin{feat}{Creature Handling Specialization}{Skill}

        \ff[3]{Binding Command} You can \glossterm{sustain} the effect of the \textit{command} ability from the Creature Handling skill with a \glossterm{minor action} instead of with a standard action.
        For details, see \pcref{Command}.

        \ff[3]{Efficient Training} You can teach a creature a trick with 12 hours of work, split as you choose, rather than in a week of 4 hour sessions (see \pcref{Training Creatures}).
        In addition, you can train creatures to learn two bonus tricks beyond their normal maximum (see \pcref{Bonus Tricks}).

        \ff[9]{Battleforged Companion} You can teach a creature the Battleforged Companion trick.
        This does not work on creatures that are already significantly enhanced or altered from their natural state, such as a druid's \textit{natural servant} or a ranger's \textit{animal companion}.
        The \glossterm{difficulty value} to train the trick is 15.
        A creature with the trick uses your level in place of its level to determine its \glossterm{hit points}, \glossterm{damage resistance}, defenses, and \glossterm{accuracy}.
        This includes any special bonuses that monsters normally gain to those values, such as the \plus1 bonus to all defenses that monsters gain at level 3.
        However, it does not include any scaling bonuses that monsters gain based on their level to other statistics, such as power.

        You can only train one creature with this trick at a time.
        If you train another creature, the previous creature loses the benefit of this training.
        In addition, you must spend at least ten minutes per day training with the creature to maintain the trick.
        Otherwise, it forgets the trick and loses its benefits.

        \ff[15]{Specialization+} The bonus from your \textit{specialization} ability increases to \plus6.

        \ff[21]{Battleforged Companion+} The creature with your Battleforged Companion trick gains the following additional benefits:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item It gains a \plus2 bonus to all defenses.
            \item It gains a \plus2 accuracy bonus with all attacks.
            \item It gains a \plus2d damage bonus with \glossterm{strikes}.

            You can freely choose which creatures hear which pattern, treating all creatures you are not aware of as a single group. 

            You can freely choose different vocal patterns each round that you sustain this ability.
            \rankline
            \featlevel{9} You can speak entirely different words with your two voices.
            \featlevel{15} You can also speak with a third voice, using separate words and vocal patterns.
            \featlevel{21} You can also speak with a fourth voice, using separate words and vocal patterns.
        \end{sustainability}

        \ff[9]{Undetectable Lies} Any \magical abilities which detect lies are unable to detect lies you speak.

        \ff[15]{Specialization+} The bonus from your \textit{specialization} ability increases to \plus6.

        \magicalff[21]{Deceive Reality} Once per \glossterm{long rest}, you can use the \ability{deceive reality} ability as a standard action.
        \begin{magicalactiveability}{Deceive Reality}
            \rankline
            You tell a lie that becomes true.
            The lie must not directly affect sentient creatures.
            The effects of the lie must be \glossterm{mundane}, so you cannot create artifacts or specific spell effects.
            You cannot affect anything beyond one mile from you, ignoring \glossterm{line of sight} and \glossterm{line of effect}.
            In addition, all effects of this ability end after ten minutes.
            However, within those limits, you can generally alter reality around you.

            Some examples of lies that would be valid to use with this ability are ``I have a bathtub full of diamonds in the other room'', ``Suddenly, all of the torches in the room were extinguished simultaneously'', and ``Don't worry, my basement cellar has always had an escape tunnel for emergencies''.
        \end{magicalactiveability}

    \begin{feat}{Devices Specialization}{Skill}
        \featpre Devices as a trained skill.

        \ff[1]{Specialization} You gain a \plus3 bonus to the Devices skill.

        % TODO: wording
        \magicalff[3]{Disable Arcana} You can affect spell effects on objects or areas with the Devices skill as if they were merely complex devices.
        You must be aware of an effect to use the Devices skill to affect it.
        You cannot affect effects on creatures.
        The \glossterm{difficulty value} to affect a spell effect is equal to 15 \add twice the effect's \glossterm{rank}.

        \ff[9]{Rapid Improvisation} It takes you only a standard action to make a device of up to Tiny size with the \textit{improvise} ability (see \pcref{Improvise}).

        \ff[15]{Specialization+} The bonus from your \textit{specialization} ability increases to \plus6.

        \ff[21]{Disable Arcana+} You can also affect spell effects on yourself as if they were merely complex devices.
        This can allow you to remove \glossterm{conditions} and other detrimental effects on you that were caused by spells.
    \end{feat}

    \begin{feat}{Disguise Specialization}{Skill}
        \featpre Disguise as a trained skill.

        \ff[9]{Versatile Disguise} Whenever you use the \textit{disguise creature} and \textit{emulate creature} abilities on yourself, you may simultaneously create two different disguises.
        This takes twice as long as creating a single disguise.
        You can change your appearance between the two chosen disguises as a \glossterm{minor action}.

        \ff[15]{Specialization+} The bonus from your \textit{specialization} ability increases to \plus6.

        \ff[21]{Quick Change+} You can create disguises with the \textit{disguise creature}, \textit{emulate creature}, and \textit{versatile disguise} abilities as a single standard action, regardless of the complexity of the disguise.

        Your maximum height is 30 feet, and your \glossterm{maneuverability} with this fly speed is poor (see \pcref{Flying Maneuverability}).
        As a \glossterm{free action}, you can increase your \glossterm{fatigue level} by one to ignore this height limit until the end of the round.
        The wings themselves are \glossterm{mundane}, but the ability to fly and glide with them is \magical.

        \ff[9]{Duel Focus} At the start of each round, you may choose a creature you can see.
        During that round, you gain a \plus1 bonus to Armor and Reflex defenses against that creature.

        \ff[15]{Defensive Stance+} The bonus from your \textit{defensive stance} ability increases to \plus2.

        \ff[21]{Duel Focus+} The bonuses from your \textit{duel focus} ability increase to \plus2.
        In addition, you also gain a \plus2 bonus to Mental defense against that creature.

        The \glossterm{difficulty value} starts at 10 and increases by 5 in each subsequent round.
        Success means that you do not suffer the effects of the condition.
        You must repeat this check at the end of each subsequent round to continue to delay the effects of the condition.
        Failure means that the condition has its normal effect on you.

        You can only delay one of your conditions in this way.
        If you gain a new condition, you can choose to either delay the new condition or continue delaying the old condition.

        \ff[9]{Sleepless Endurance} You need half the normal amount of rest and sleep each day to function normally.
        For example, a human would only need four hours of sleep per night.
        This does not reduce the time required for you to take a \glossterm{long rest}.

        \ff[15]{Specialization+} The bonus from your \textit{specialization} ability increases to \plus6.

        \ff[21]{Ignore Vital Wound} When you use the \textit{delay vital wound} ability, the \glossterm{difficulty value} does not increase for each subsequent round, allowing you to delay the wound indefinitely.

        \featpre Willpower 2.

        \ff[1]{Entropic Defense} Whenever you are hit by a \glossterm{critical hit}, there is a 20\% chance that the attack is treated as a regular hit against you instead of a critical hit.

        \ff[3]{Sudden Entropy} You can use the \textit{sudden entropy} ability as a standard action.
        \begin{magicalactiveability}{Sudden Entropy}

            You gain a \plus1 accuracy bonus and a \plus1d damage bonus at 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter.
        \end{magicalactiveability}

        \ff[9]{Friend of Chaos} Whenever you roll for a random effect, such as a \glossterm{miss chance} or a sorcerer's \textit{wild magic} ability, you may roll twice and keep whichever result you prefer.
        This does not affect your own \textit{entropic defense} ability, since the attacker rolls that chance instead of you.

        \ff[15]{Improbable Vulnerability} Whenever you make an attack against an \glossterm{enemy} that is \trait{immune} or \trait{impervious} to some aspect of the attack, you have a 50\% chance to affect them as if they were not immune or impervious to the attack.
        This has no effect on objects.

        \ff[21]{Entropic Defense+} The chance from your \textit{entropic defense} ability increases to 50\%.

        \ff[21]{Master of Chaos} Whenever you roll for a random effect, such as a miss chance or a sorcerer's \textit{wild magic} ability, you may use this ability.
        When you do, you increase your \glossterm{fatigue level} by two, and you may freely choose the random result.
    \end{magicalfeat}

    \begin{feat}{Executioner}{Combat}

        Several abilities from this feat affect creatures \textit{marked for execution}.

        % This ability is melee-only because it makes some of the questions around ``is this creature marked''
        % less narratively awkward since you can automatically detect them with blood sense.
        \ff[1]{Execution} You can use the \textit{execution} ability as a standard action.
        \begin{activeability}{Execution}
            \rankline
            Make a melee \glossterm{strike}.
            If the target is \textit{marked for execution}, you gain two benefits.
            First, you gain a \plus4 damage bonus with the strike.
            Second, if you get a \glossterm{critical hit}, you double all of your damage bonuses along with your damage dice.

            \rankline
            \featlevel{6} The damage bonus increases to \plus8.
            \featlevel{12} The damage bonus increases to \plus16.
            \featlevel{18} The damage bonus increases to \plus24.
        \end{activeability}

        \magicalff[3]{Blood Sense} You gain \trait{lifesense} with a 60 foot range, allowing you to sense the location of living creatures without light (see \pcref{Lifesense}).
        Your lifesense functions like \trait{lifesight} against creatures who are \textit{marked for execution}, allowing you to see them perfectly.
        You can also automatically identify which creatures within the range of your lifesense are \textit{marked for execution}, even if you can already see them normally.

        \ff[9]{Purge the Weak} You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} against creatures that are \textit{marked for execution}.
        In addition, your attack rolls against creatures that are \textit{marked for execution} \glossterm{explode} on a 9 in addition to the normal explosion on a 10.
        This does not affect additional rolls with exploding dice.

        \magicalff[15]{Blood Sense+} The range of the lifesense from your \textit{blood sense} ability increases by 120 feet.
        In addition, you no longer need \glossterm{line of effect} to see creatures that are \textit{marked for execution}.
        This allows you to see them through solid objects, but grants you no special ability to attack through solid objects, so your attacks are still affected normally by \glossterm{cover}.

        \ff[21]{Greater Purge the Weak} The bonus from your \textit{purge the weak} ability increases to \plus2.
        In addition, the first die you roll for each attack roll against a creature that is \textit{marked for execution} \glossterm{explodes} on an 8 or 9 in addition to the normal explosion on a 10.

    \begin{feat}{Flexibility Specialization}{Skill}
        \featpre Flexibility as a trained skill.

        \ff[1]{Specialization} You gain a \plus3 bonus to the Flexibility skill.

        \ff[3]{Rapid Escape} You can squeeze and escape bindings and grapples as a \glossterm{movement}, rather than as a standard action.

        \ff[9]{Constraint Tolerance} You reduce your penalties for \squeezing by 2 (see \pcref{Squeezing}).
        In addition, your movement speed is not reduced while \squeezing.

        \ff[15]{Specialization+} The bonus from your \textit{specialization} ability increases to \plus6.

        \magicalff[21]{Escape Magic} You can use the \textit{escape magic} ability as a standard action.
        \begin{magicalactiveability}{Escape Magic}
            \rankline
            You make an Flexibility attack against all \magical effects on you.
            You may exclude any number of effects you are aware of from this attack, allowing you to maintain beneficial magical effects.
            The \glossterm{difficulty value} for each effect is equal to 10 \add twice the effect's \glossterm{rank}.
            \hit Each effect is \glossterm{dismissed}, if it is an effect that can be dismissed.
            Unless otherwise noted, all \magical abilities with a duration can be dismissed, including \glossterm{conditions} (see \pcref{Dismissal}).

            You can only dismiss effects with this ability which target you directly, not area effects which include you as a target.
            If an ability targets multiple creatures, you can only remove its effects on you.

    \begin{magicalfeat}{Ghostblade}{Combat, Magical}
        \featpre Dexterity 1, Willpower 2.

        \ff[1]{Ghost Step} When you use the \textit{sprint} ability, you can become \trait{invisible} for the duration of the movement (see \pcref{Invisible}, and \pcref{Sprint}).
        This usually makes it impossible for creatures to react to your movement, such as by using the \textit{follow} or \textit{withdraw} abilities (see \pcref{Movement Abilities}).
        This ability has the \abilitytag{Swift} tag, so it affects attacks against you during the current phase.

            Each creature that loses \glossterm{hit points} from this strike is \glossterm{briefly} \slowed.
            After it stops being slowed, it becomes immune to being slowed in this way until it takes a short rest.

        This does not help you create other alchemical items, such as alchemist's fire.
        When you do, you must use esoteric natural ingredients in place of the normal ingredients.
        However, all poisons you create with this ability deteriorate and lose their effectiveness after 8 hours.

        The replacement ingredients must be difficult to acquire in large quantities and impossible to acquire in a normal city.
        For example, you can use the tail of a blind mouse or the dew from a four-leafed clover, but you could not use dirt or ordinary tree bark.
        Once you have determined a purpose for a particular replacement ingredient, you cannot use that ingredient as a replacement in any other poison or potion.

        In general, it requires an hour of work and a Knowledge (nature) check equal to 5 \add twice the rank of the item to find ingredients for an item in this way.
        Each time you find ingredients for an item this way, the time required to find ingredients again increases by an hour and the difficulty value increases by 5.
        Whenever you finish a \glossterm{long rest} or enter a different environment with different ingredients, these penalties reset.

            Whenever an \glossterm{enemy} notices the chosen object, make a \glossterm{reactive attack} vs. Mental against it.
            You are not aware of this attack, so you cannot use abilities like \ability{desperate exertion} to affect it.
            If the poison or potion is not concealed inside a less suspicious object, such as a tankard of ale or an apple, you take a \minus4 penalty to \glossterm{accuracy}.
            You cannot make this attack more than once against any individual target during this ability's duration.
            \hit The target is filled with the desire to investigate and try to consume the liquid or the object containing the liquid.
            It will not generally interrupt combat or wander into obvious danger to fulfill its desire, but individual creatures may react more or less strongly.
            This effect lasts until the target consumes the object or until it takes a \glossterm{short rest}.

            \rankline
            You gain a \plus2 accuracy bonus with the attack for every 3 levels beyond 3.

            If one spell affects a strictly larger area or a strictly larger number of targets than the other, you must use the smaller of the two areas or target counts.
            You must choose the same targets and area for both spells, if applicable.
            Roll the attack roll and damage for each spell separately.

            After you use this ability, you are unable to take any actions during the \glossterm{action phase} of the following round.
        \end{magicalactiveability}

        \ff[15]{Adaptive Metamagic+} You can choose an additional spell you know with your \textit{adaptive metamagic} ability.
        In addition, you can apply two metamagic abilities to your chosen spells, rather than only one.

        \ff[21]{Spell Fusion+} Using your \textit{spell fusion} ability does not prevent you from taking \glossterm{minor actions} during the following round.

        \featpre Access to a \glossterm{mystic sphere}.

            Make a ranged \glossterm{strike} with a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} using a \glossterm{projectile weapon} you wield.
            Because this is a \magical ability, you use your \glossterm{magical power} to determine your damage instead of your \glossterm{mundane power} (see \pcref{Power}).

            \rankline
            \featlevel{6} The accuracy bonus increases to \plus2.

        \ff[1]{Magical Strikes} Whenever you make a projectile \glossterm{strike}, you can choose to treat that as a \magical ability.
        When you do, you use your \glossterm{magical power} to determine your damage instead of your \glossterm{mundane power} (see \pcref{Power}).

        \ff[3]{Imbue Projectile} When you cast a spell as a \glossterm{standard action}, if that spell does not have the \abilitytag{Attune} or \abilitytag{Sustain} tags,
            you can use the \textit{imbue projectile} ability.
        \begin{magicalattuneability}{Imbue Projectile}{\abilitytag{Attune}}
            \rankline
            The spell does not have its effect immediately.
            Instead, its power is imbued in a \glossterm{projectile} you hold.
            An individual projectile can only be imbued with this ability once, even if multiple creatures use this ability on the same projectile.

            When you use your \textit{imbued shot} ability to attack with that projectile, the spell takes effect on the target of your \textit{imbued shot} ability.
            You must make any attack rolls required for the spell separately from your attack roll with the strike.
            After the spell takes effect this way, your attunement to this ability ends.
        \end{magicalattuneability}

        \ff[9]{Phasing Projectiles} Your projectile \glossterm{strikes} ignore \glossterm{cover}.
        In addition, you can ignore ignore all physical obstacles in single one-foot span.
        This can allow you to fire projectiles through creatures or solid walls, though it does not grant you the ability to see through a wall.

        \ff[15]{Guided Projectiles} Your projectile \glossterm{strikes} ignore all \glossterm{miss chances}, such as from \glossterm{concealment}.
        This does not prevent your attacks from failing for other reasons.

        \ff[21]{Imbue Projectile+} Your \textit{imbue projectile} ability loses the \abilitytag{Attune} tag.
        Instead, it lasts until you use it again.

        \ff[1]{Nullify Magic} You gain a \plus4 bonus to your \glossterm{defenses} against \magical abilities.
        In exchange, you lose the benefits of all \magical abilities you possess.
        You are unable to \glossterm{attune} to any \magical abilities, such as magic items or spells cast by other creatures.
        You cannot use \glossterm{potions} or other similar magic items or abilities that affect you personally, even if they do not require attunement.
        In addition, you are never considered an \glossterm{ally} for a \magical ability, even while \unconscious.

        % Much stronger than Spellbreaker because this is a huge part of the whole Null thing
        \ff[1]{Sever Magic} You can use the \textit{sever magic} ability as a standard action.

            If it has any magical abilities, but has no remaining attuned effects, it becomes \dazed as a \glossterm{condition} instead.
            On a \glossterm{critical hit}, the target takes double damage and it stops being attuned to two abilities of its choice that it is currently attuned to.
            In addition, as a \glossterm{condition}, it stops being able to attune to abilities.

            \rankline
            \featlevel{6} You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with the strike.
            \featlevel{12} A struck target stops being attuned to an additional effect of its choice.
            \featlevel{18} The accuracy bonus increases to \plus2.

        \ff[3]{Mundane Resilience} You gain a bonus to your \glossterm{hit points} and \glossterm{damage resistance} equal to your level.

        \ff[3]{Personal Legacy} You do not gain any legacy item upgrades (see \pcref{Legacy Items}).
        Instead, each time you would gain a legacy item upgrade, you instead gain a \plus1 bonus to your \glossterm{accuracy}, your \glossterm{fatigue tolerance}, and all \glossterm{defenses}.

        % clarify that it does not affect spells already in progress in the current phase?
        \ff[9]{Disruptive Presence} Whenever an \glossterm{enemy} within an \medarea radius from you uses a \magical ability as a standard action, the ability has a 50\% chance to fail with no effect.
        This cannot cause passive or triggered abilities to fail.

        \ff[15]{Mundane Resilience+} The bonuses from your \textit{mundane resilience} ability increase to twice your level.

        \ff[15]{Nullify Magic+} The bonus to your defenses from your \textit{nullify magic} ability increases to \plus8.

        \ff[1]{Specialization} You gain a \plus3 bonus to all Perform skills.

        \ff[3]{Synergistic Performance} You can use any Perform skill you are \glossterm{trained} with in place of other related skills.
        Each Perform skill has an associated skill that it can be used to replace, as listed below.
        When you replace a skill in this way, you add half your modifier with the Perform skill instead of your full modifier since the two skills do not exactly match.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Acting: Deception
            \item Comedy: Deception

        \magicalff[9]{Inspiring Performance} Whenever you perform with the Perform skill, each \glossterm{ally} that can observe the performance gains a \plus1 bonus to Mental defense.
        % This solves the "always active except on round 1" problem
        This effect has the \abilitytag{Swift} tag, so it protects allies in the same phase that you begin performing.
        This includes both normal performances and any special abilities that require performances.
        This bonus lasts as long as the performance lasts.

        \ff[15]{Specialization+} The bonus from your \textit{specialization} ability increases to \plus5.

        \ff[21]{Inspiring Performance+} The bonus from your \textit{inspiring performance} ability increases to \plus2.

            Make an attack vs. Mental against a creature within \rngmed range.
            Your \glossterm{accuracy} is equal to your Persuasion skill.
            You take a \minus10 penalty to \glossterm{accuracy} with this attack against creatures who have made an attack or been attacked since the start of the last round.
            You must talk loud enough for the target to hear to draw its attention.
            \hit The target only pays attention to you as long as you sustain this ability, which requires maintaining your conversation with it.
            It takes a \minus20 penalty to Awareness checks to observe anything unrelated to your conversation.
            Any act by you or by creatures that appear to be your ally that damages a target or that causes it to feel that it is in danger breaks the effect for that creature.

            \rankline
            \featlevel{9} You may target up to five creatures within range.
            \featlevel{15} You may target any number of creatures within range.
            \featlevel{21} The range increases to \distrange.
        \end{sustainability}

        \ff[9]{First Impressions} When you first meet creatures, you have an Ally relationship instead of a Just Met relationship (see \tref{Relationship Modifiers}.
        This does not affect your relationship with creatures who would not normally have a Just Met relationship with you.

        \ff[15]{Specialization+} The bonus from your \textit{specialization} ability increases to \plus6.

        \magicalff[21]{Suggestion} You can use the \textit{suggestion} ability as a standard action.

            Make an attack vs. Mental against a creature within \rngmed range.
            Your \glossterm{accuracy} is equal to your Persuasion skill.
            You must also make a verbal suggestion of a particular course of action to the target.
            If your suggestion does not seem reasonable, you take a \minus5 accuracy penalty on this attack.
            Exceptionally unreasonable suggestions can impose even greater penalties, and exceptionally reasonable suggestions can give accuracy bonuses.

            \hit As a \glossterm{condition}, the target thinks your suggestion is a good idea and will try to follow it to the best of its abilities.
            Any act by you or by creatures that appear to be your ally that damages the target or makes it feel that it is in danger breaks the effect.
            An observant target may interpret overt threats to its \glossterm{allies} as a threat to itself.

    \begin{feat}{Precognition}{General}

            Choose a creature within \medrange of you.
            That creature's intentions become obvious to you as long as you sustain this ability.
            This gives you a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} and \glossterm{defenses} against that creature.

            In addition, when you choose your action during each phase, you can do so after learning the result of the actions the target took during that phase.
            This includes learning whether its attacks hit, and any obvious effects of those attacks.
            You do not gain any knowledge of actions that have no obvious signs, such as purely mental actions, or actions which you are not observant enough to notice.
            You cannot communicate your understanding of the creature's actions to your allies before they decide their actions.
        \end{sustainability}

        \ff[9]{Mobile Foresight} During the \glossterm{movement phase}, you choose your action after all other creatures have chosen their actions.
        When you choose your action, you have insight into the actions chosen by any creatures within \longrange of you that you can see.
        This insight gives you the same information as the insight from your \textit{combat prediction} ability, except that it only provides information about their actions during the movement phase.
        You choose your actions simultaneously with any other creatures who have a similar ability.

        Knowing another creature's action does not automatically allow you to interrupt that action.
        If you want to interrupt an action, such as by blocking a creature's intended movement, you must make an \glossterm{initiative} check as normal.

        \ff[15]{Precognitive Precision} You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy}.

        You inscribe the knowledge of those spells into a book you carry with you.
        This book is your spellbook.

        You cannot carry over more than half your land speed in this way.

        \ff[9]{Evasive Reaction} You take no damage from \glossterm{glancing blows} caused by abilities that affect an area and attack your Armor or Reflex defense.
        This does not protect you from any non-damaging effects of those abilities, or from abilities that affect multiple specific targets without affecting an area.
        If you have the \textit{evasion} monk or rogue ability with the same effect as this ability, you also gain a \plus2 bonus to your Armor and Reflex defenses against area attacks.

        You can use this ability to remove vital wounds even once your fatigue level would already make you unconscious.
        This allows you to recover any number of vital wounds if you go unconscious to do so, regardless of your maximum fatigue level.

        \ff[15]{Battlefield Regeneration} When you use the \textit{recover} action, you can also remove a single vital wound.
        If you do, you increase your fatigue level by one.

        You must be able to reach at least one of your fingers into the bag, such as through a narrow gap at the opening.
        This does not allow you to retrieve objects from locked containers with no openings.

            \hit You know the target's current emotions.
            In addition to the obvious effects, this grants you a \plus3 bonus to Deception, Persuasion, Intimidate, and Social Insight attacks and checks against the target.

            Instead, its power is imbued in a non-projectile weapon you hold.
            An individual weapon can only be imbued with this ability once.

            When you use your \textit{imbued blow} ability to make a strike with that weapon, you may choose to activate the spell.
            If you do, the spell takes effect on the target of your \textit{imbued blow} ability as if you had just cast it.
            You must make any attack rolls required for the spell separately from your attack roll with the strike.
            After the spell takes effect this way, your attunement to this ability ends.

        \ff[15]{Multiple Hands} When you use the \spell{distant hand} cantrip, you can create two hands instead of one.
        This can allow you to hold multiple objects simultaneously, though you must still take separate actions to manipulate those objects in any way more complicated than simple movement.
        Alternately, you can hold a single object with two hands instead of one.
        This gives you a \plus1 bonus to your Willpower for the purpose of determining your \glossterm{weight limits}, and allows you to make attacks with \glossterm{heavy weapons} using your \ability{telekinetic strike} ability.

        \ff[21]{Agile Levitation} You gain a \glossterm{fly speed} equal to the \glossterm{base speed} for your size with a maximum height of 30 feet (see \pcref{Flight}).

        Whenever a creature makes you lose \glossterm{hit points} with a \glossterm{melee} strike using a non-Long weapon, you make a \glossterm{reactive attack} vs. Fortitude against the attacking creature.
        On a hit, it becomes \glossterm{poisoned} by your choice of one of the poisons you store with this ability.

        In addition, you can ignore \glossterm{cover} and \glossterm{concealment} from plants whenever doing so would be beneficial to you, as the plants move out of the way to help you.
        This prevents you from suffering a miss chance on your attacks, and also prevents creatures from using cover or concealment from plants to hide from you.

        \ff[3]{Residual Undergrowth} Whenever you cast a spell from the \textit{verdamancy} sphere, you may create either \glossterm{light undergrowth} or \glossterm{heavy undergrowth} in the area of the spell.
        The undergrowth persists \glossterm{briefly}.

            You know exactly what direction you must travel to reach your chosen destination by the most direct physical route.
            You are not always led in the exact direction of the destination -- if there is an impassable obstacle between the target and the destination, this ability will direct you around the obstacle, rather than through it.

            \crit Double damage dice as normal, and the target is dazed if it takes damage instead of if it loses hit points.
            \hit The target takes 1d10 + \glossterm{power} psychic damage.
            If it loses \glossterm{hit points} from this damage, it becomes \dazed as a \glossterm{condition}.

            \rankline
            You gain a \plus1 accuracy bonus and a \plus1d damage bonus at 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter.

            You cannot directly search the target's mind for arbitrary thoughts or information.
            However, creatures often think about questions they are asked, and their thoughts may reveal much more than their words.
            \crit You can also delve through the target's mind to answer a specific question.
            You can pose a question to it mentally and search its mind to know the exact answer to that question.
            This takes five rounds of continuous concentration, and you can only get answers to one such question each time you use this ability.
            The process of searching a creature's mind in this way is no easier to notice than normal for a \abilitytag{Subtle} ability.

        \ff[21]{Durability+} The bonus from your \textit{durability} ability increases to twice your level.

        You must still have them on your person, such as in a pocket or strapped to your back, and you must still be attuned to them to gain their benefits.
        In addition, if your legacy item is an apparel item, you may choose both apparel and implement magic item effects for it.

        \ff[9]{Twinspell} You can use the \textit{twinspell} ability as a \glossterm{standard action}.

            You cast both spells simultaneously, one with each hand.

            Both spells must affect completely different targets, with no overlap between their targets or areas (if any).
            You cannot use the \ability{desperate exertion} ability to affect either spell.
        \end{magicalactiveability}

        Several abilities from this feat only function while you are dual-wielding.

        In addition, you can use the \textit{offhand strike} ability during any phase that you take a \glossterm{standard action}, regardless of whether that standard action causes you to make a \glossterm{strike}.

        \ff[3]{Two-Weapon Stance} At the start of each round, you can enter one of the stances below or change which stance you are in.
        You can maintain that stance as long as you are dual-wielding.

            \item Deflecting Offhand: You gain a \plus3 bonus to your Armor defense.
                However, you cannot use the \ability{offhand strike} ability.
                This bonus is considered to come from a shield, and it does not stack with the benefits of using any other shield.
            \item Offhand Precision: When you use the \ability{offhand strike} ability, you can roll the attack roll twice and keep the higher result.
            \item Two Weapons As One: You gain a \plus2 bonus to your \glossterm{accuracy} with \glossterm{strikes}.

        In addition, they treat all damage as being \glossterm{environmental damage}, so their damage resistance is never reduced (see \pcref{Environmental Damage}).
        For objects with multiple separate hit point values, such as walls, this bonus applies independently to each section.

        \ff[3]{Defensive Barriers} You gain a \plus1 bonus to your Armor defense.
        In addition, objects you create with \abilitytag{Barrier} abilities have minimum defenses equal to 5 \add half your level.

        Certain unusual creatures that occupy their entire space, such as gelatinous cubes, may be immune to this ability.
        If you end your movement in a creature's space with this ability, you and that creature are \squeezing if you are no more than one size category larger or smaller than it.
