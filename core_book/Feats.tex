\chapter{Feats}\label{Feats}

Feats are special abilities that every character has.
Feats can be used to specialize in a particular area, to gain new abilities, or to change the way you do certain things.

\section{Gaining Feats}
    You gain one feat from your race (see \pcref{Races} at 1st level).
    At 2nd, 5th, and 9th level, you also gain any feat of your choice that you qualify for.
    You cannot gain the same feat twice.

    \subsection{Prerequisites}
        Some feats have prerequisites.
        Unless you meet all of the prerequisites, you cannot take the feat.
        Prerequisites can include a minimum starting attribute score, another feat or feats, a minimum level of training in a skill, or some other property of a character.
        A character can gain a feat at the same level at which he or she gains the prerequisite.

        A character can't use a feat if he or she has lost a prerequisite.

\section{Feat Tags}
    All feats are organized into different groups by tags.

    \parhead{General} General feats can have a wide variety of effects.
    They often grant new abilities or improve your defenses.
    % General feats improve at 1/4/7/10/...

    \parhead{Combat} Combat feats improve your combat capabilities.
    They can increase the damage you deal, grant you new combat abilities, or improve your defenses.
    % Combat feats improve at 1/3/6/9/...

    \parhead{Spell} Spell feats improve your spellcasting abilities.
    Spell feats are useless to characters who cannot cast spells.
    % Spell feats improve at 1/3/6/9/...

    \parhead{Skill} Skill feats improve your skills.
    They can make you more likely to succeed with skill checks and grant you new abilities based on your skills.
    % Skill feats improve at 1/2/5/8/...

    \parhead{Bloodline Feats} Some characters have traces of monstrous blood running in their veins.
    Most of those will never understand the full potential of their unusual heritage.
    Bloodline feats allow characters to explore those posibilities by gaining abilites related to their ancestry.
    You can only have one Bloodline feat.
    % Bloodline feats improve at 1/2/5/8/...

    \parhead{Magical Feats}
    All abilities granted by feats with the Magical type are \glossterm{magical} in nature.
    Many feats are not entirely magical, but have specific effects that are magical.

\section{Feat Tables}

% Feat names must follow ``I have'' or ``I am (a)''.

    \section{Feat Descriptions}
        Each feat has a set of benefits it provides to a character with the feat.
        Some feats also have specific requirements that a character must meet before taking the feat.
        These are listed under a \textbf{Prerequisites} heading.
        If a character loses the prerequisites for a feat, they lose all benefits of the feat until they meet the prerequisites again.

    \begin{feat}{Acrobatics Specialization}{Skill}
        \featpre Acrobatics as a mastered skill.

        \ff{Rapid Balance} Using Acrobatics to balance on slippery or narrow surfaces does not reduce your speed.

        \ff[2]{Specialization} You gain a \plus2 bonus to Acrobatics.

        \ff[5]{Surface Tolerance} You reduce DR modifiers for surface conditions on Acrobatics checks to balance by 2.
        This allows you to ignore minor surface conditions, such as slippery surfaces, when balancing.

        \ff[8]{Greater Specialization} The bonus from your \textit{specialization} ability increases to \plus4.

         % modifier at 10th: 12dex + 2mst + 2ft = 16
        \ff[11]{Air Dancer}[Magical] You can attempt to move on surfaces that cannot support your weight.
        Surfaces that can support at least a quarter of your weight, such as thin tree branches and dense liquids, are DR 20.
        Surfaces that can support at least a tenth of your weight, such as water, are DR 25.
        Surfaces that can support at least a hundredth of your weight, such as tree leaves, are DR 30.
        Surfaces that cannot support your weight at all, such as air, are DR 40.

        Success means you move along the surface at half speed.
        Failure means you fall through the surface.
        The DR increases by 5 for each consecutive round that you spend moving in this way.

        \ff[14]{Supreme Specialization} The bonus from your \textit{specialization} ability increases to \plus6.

        \ff[17]{Greater Surface Tolerance} The DR modifier reduction from your \textit{surface tolerance} ability increases to 5.

        The DR is equal to 10 \add the \glossterm{power} of the ability you are deceiving.
        % does this work mechanically?
        For example, if you impersonate an undead creature, the \spell{inflict light wounds} spell would heal you.
        This does not grant you any abilities associated with creatures you impersonate.

            Unlike normal, that activation is not \glossterm{dismissed} by the spell you are currently casting (see \pcref{Duplicate Attunement Abilities}).
            This can allow you to have two activations of the same spell active at once.

            If you use this ability while it already affects another spell, you choose which spell is affected by the ability.

            Both targets must within that spell's range of you, and must be valid targets for the spell.
            You cannot target yourself with this ability.

            If both targets are willing, the spell's effect is transferred from the first target to the second.

            You can only use this ability on one spell at a time.
            If you use this ability while it already affects another spell, you choose which spell is affected by the ability.
            % This has a bizarre edge case involving you being one of multiple targets for a multi-attunement effect,
            % but there is only one of those in the game and it's a ritual, so it's not worth worrying about.
            The other spell is immediately \glossterm{dismissed}.
        \end{ability}
