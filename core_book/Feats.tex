\chapter{Feats}\label{Feats}

Feats are special abilities that every character has.
Feats can be used to specialize your character particular area, to grant your character new abilities, or to change the way your character does certain things.

\section{Gaining Feats}
Your character gains a feat every odd level: 1st, 3rd, 5th, and so on.
Classes can sometimes grant bonus feats as well, which are in addition to these feats which every character gets.

\subsection{Prerequisites}
Some feats have prerequisites.
Your character must have the indicated attribute score, ability, feat, skill, combat prowess, or other quality designated in order to select or use that feat.
A character can gain a feat at the same level at which he or she gains the prerequisite.

A character can't use a feat if he or she has lost a prerequisite.

\section{Types Of Feats}
Some feats are general, meaning that no special rules govern
them as a group.
Others belong to particular categories.
The categories are given below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bloodline feats allow a character to tap into latent magical abilities in their blood.
    \item Magic feats affect the way a character casts spells or uses magic.
    \item Metamagic feats let spellcasters cast spells with greater effect, albeit as if the spells were a higher level than they actually are.
    \item Performance feats allow a character to create magical effects through skilled performances.
    \item Rage feats improve a character's ability to enter an angry rage in combat.
        A character can only use one rage feat at a time.
    \item Skill feats affect a character's mastery of his or her skills.
    \item Spellgift feats grant a non-spellcasting character a limited ability to use spells.
    %\item Surge feats allow a character to temporarily gain supernatural abilities.
    \item Combat feats affect a character's prowess in combat.
    \item Combat maneuver feats are combat feats which grant a character particular talent with specific maneuvers.
    \item Combat strike feats allow a character to impose special effects when they strike a foe.
    \item Combat style feats change the way a character fights.
        A character can only use one style at a time.
    %\item Bane feats provide characters with bonuses against specific kinds of foes.
        %You can only gain the benefits of a single Bane feat against a particular creature.
        %If more than such feat applies, choose which one to gain the benefits from.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Bloodline Feats}

Some characters have traces of monstrous blood running in their veins.
Most of those will never understand the full potential of their unusual heritage.
Bloodline feats allow characters to explore those posibilities by gaining abilites related to their ancestry.
Each bloodline feat belongs to a specific type of monster, such as ``dragon''.
Some bloodline feats have stronger effects if you have more feats from that heritage.

\subsection{Class Feats}
Class feats improve a character's class abilities, or grant new special abilities related to a class.

\subsection{Metamagic Feats}
Metamagic feats change properties of spells you cast.
Spells modified by a metamagic feat are treated as being higher level than normal.
They require higher level spell slots to cast, and cannot be cast unless you have access to normal spells of the spell's modified level.
All effects dependent on spell level are calculated according to the spell's modified level.
Metamagic feats cannot be used to enhance spell-like abilities, magic item abilities, or other effects which are not spells.

\parhead{Combining Metamagic Feats}
You can apply multiple metamagic feats to a single spell.
Changes to the spell's level are cumulative.
You can't apply the same metamagic feat more than once to a single spell.

\parhead{Magic Items and Metamagic Spells}
With the right feats, you can store a metamagic version of a spell in a scroll, potion, or wand.
Level limits for potions and wands apply to the spell's higher spell level (after the application of the metamagic feat).
A character doesn't need the metamagic feat to activate an item storing a metamagic version of a spell.

\subsection{Performance Feats}
Performance feats allow a character to use the Perform skill to create magical effects.
All Performance feats are also Skill feats.

Each performance has an effect when it is used.
Most performances continue their effects if you continue performing.

All performance feats are \glossterm{Auditory}, \glossterm{Speech}, or \glossterm{Visual} effects, depending on the nature of the performance used to activate the feat.

You can use any combination of performance feats you possess a number of times per day equal to twice the number of performance feats you have.
If you fail the Perform check, the use of the ability is wasted.

\subsection{Racial Feats}\label{Racial Feats}
Racial feats improve a character's racial abilities or grant new abilities unique to the character's race.

\subsection{Skill Feats}
Skill feats improve a character's skills or grant them new abilities related to the skills they already have.

\subsection{Spellgift Feats}
Spellgift feats grant limited spell-like abilities.
They may represent the fruits of eldritch pacts, unusual heritage, the exposure to powerful magic, or a particular expression of innate magical ability.
You can use any combination of spell-like abilities gained from spellgift feats a number of times per day equal to the number of spellgift feats you possess.
The number of spellgift feats you have, plus the levels you have in spellcasting classes, cannot exceed your Willpower.

If your Willpower is lowered below this value, or you gain additional levels in spellcasting classes, you are treated as not possessing the spellgift feats you do not qualify for, as normal for feat prerequisites.
You lose access to the spellgift feats in order by when you acquired them, starting with the most recent feat.

\subsection{Combat Feats}
Combat feats affect a character's combat abilities.
Many combat feats require a minimum combat prowess to acquire.

\subsection{Combat Maneuver Feats}
Combat maneuver feats are combat feats which specifically deal with maneuvers -- pushing opponents around, grappling them, tripping them, or other unusual attacks.
Any feat designated as a combat maneuver feat is also considered a combat feat.

\subsection{Style Feats}
Style feats grant a character the ability to fight or cast spells in a particular style, granting them bonuses while in that style.
A character can only be in one style at once.
Initiating a style or changing to a different style is a swift action, but a style can be stopped as a free action.

Most style feats have requirements.
If a style requires specific equipment, such as a melee weapon, you must meet the requirements to activate the style.
If you fail to meet a style's requirements during a round, you leave the style at the end of the round.

\subsection{Strike Feats}\label{Strike Feats}
Strike feats grant a character the ability to make unusual physical attacks.
Most strike feats replace a certain number of \glossterm{strikes} you would normally make.
Usually, this means strike feats are used as part of a standard attack action.
Some strike feats instead require a specific action to use.

\featpres Nonevil alignment, Celestial Heritage.
\featben As a standard action, you can spend a celestial point to imbue your body with celestial resilience for a \durshort duration.

If a character gains a feat as a bonus feat that he or she has already acquired through other means, the character may select instead any other feat for which she qualifies.

\subsection{Retraining Feats}
At every even level, your character can choose to retrain an old feat in exchange for a new feat.
You can only retrain feats for other feats you could have acquired at the time you took the original feat.
Thus, you cannot retrain feats gained through class abilities which give you a specific feat, since there were no other feats you could have taken.
For example, a 6th level fighter can retrain his 2nd level fighter bonus feat for any other combat feat that he qualified for at his 2nd fighter level.
