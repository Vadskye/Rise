\section{Attributes}

    \subsection{Other Methods of Attribute Generation}
        Point buy offers the fairest and most customizable system for determining attribute scores, ensuring that players can be almost any character they want to be. However, some groups may wish to determine attribute scores differently. Other options are provided below.

        \subsubsection{Simple Random Point Buy}
            With this method, you have only a small degree of control over your attribute scores, but all characters generated in this way are equally powerful.
            As with the point buy method, all your attribute scores start at 0, and you get 10 points to distribute among your attribute scores.
            However, you do not have full control over how to distribute those points.

            For each attribute, starting with the attributes you care about most, roll 1d8.
            You spend that many points on that attribute, ignoring any extra points that can't be spent
            For example, if you roll a 4, you spend 3 points on the attribute, causing you to start with a 2.
            If you do not have enough points remaining to spend the amount indicated by the die roll, spend as many as you can and move on to the next attribute.

            If you have points remaining after rolling all of your attribute scores, you may distribute the points freely among your abilities, using the normal point buy rules.
            You cannot increase the starting value of any individual attribute by more than 1 during this stage.
            If any of your attributes start as a 0, you may choose to lower them to gain the normal benefits from having low attributes (see \pcref{Attribute Penalties}).

            To further limit your character creation options, you may choose to randomize the order in which you roll your attributes instead of rolling them in an order of your choice.

        \subsubsection{Smoothed Random Point Buy}
            This method functions like the Simple Random Point Buy method, except that the resulting attribute values have a smoother distribution, and you can randomly end up with attribute penalties.

            For each attribute, starting with the attributes you care about most, roll 4d6.
            Then, remove any one of the rolls after seeing the results.
            Sum the results of the remaining three dice and spend the appropriate number of attribute points as indicated in \trefnp{Smoothed Random Point Buy Results}.
            If you do not have enough points remaining to spend the amount indicated by the die roll, spend as many as you can and move on to the next ability.

            If you have points remaining after rolling all of your attribute scores, you may distribute the points freely among your abilities, using the normal point buy rules.
            You cannot increase the starting value of any individual attribute by more than 1 during this stage.

            To further limit your character creation options, you may choose to randomize the order in which you roll your attributes instead of rolling them in an order of your choice.

            \begin{dtable}
                \lcaption{Smoothed Random Point Buy Results}
                \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{X X X}
                    \tb{Roll} & \tb{Base Attribute} & \tb{Point Cost} \tableheaderrule
                    3-4       & \minus2             & 0\fn{1} \\
                    5-6       & \minus1             & 0\fn{2} \\
                    7-8       & 0                   & 0       \\
                    9-10      & 1                   & 1       \\
                    11-12     & 2                   & 2       \\
                    13-15     & 3                   & 4       \\
                    16-18     & 4                   & 6       \\
                \end{dtabularx}
                1 You gain one \glossterm{insight point}. \\
                2 You gain an additional \glossterm{trained skill}. \\
            \end{dtable}

        \subsubsection{Classic Hardcore}

            This method is completely random and can generate very overpowered or underpowered characters.
            It represents the unfairness of the world, where some people are just better or worse than others.
            For each attribute, roll 2d6, take the average (rounded down), and subtract 2.
            If you roll a 1 on both dice, treat the average as a 0.
            The result is your base value for that attribute.

\section{Epic Fate}
    After 21st level, characters no longer gain levels normally.
    However, they can still increase their personal power as they make progress towards their ultimate fate.

    When you reach 21st level, you may choose an epic fate that you qualify for, or you may delay choosing until you meet the prerequisites for your desired fate.
    You do not start with any ranks in you chosen epic fate.
    Each epic fate specifies ways that you can make progress towards that epic fate.
    Whenever you make dramatic progress towards your epic fate, your rank in that epic fate may increase, at the discretion of the Game Master.

    None of the epic fate abilities have a tag to indicate that they are \glossterm{magical} abilities.
    Many of them are not fundamentally \glossterm{mundane} in nature, but they are beyond normal magic, and effects like an \spell{antimagic field} cannot interact with or suppress them.

    \subsection{Artificial Immortality}
        You have sought out strange magical power in search of a way to artificially prolong your life.
        As your power grows, you become increasingly able to resist death and return from it.
        Eventually, you will transcend death entirely.

        \parhead{Prerequisites} You must perform a series of rituals to prepare yourself for immortality, at least one of which must be rank 7 or higher. There are many kinds of immortality that you can pursue with this epic fate, and the exact nature of the rituals will change depending on the type of immortality you pursue. For example, you can have a phylactery regenerate a new body for you like a lich, you can create clones of yourself that you inhabit if your first body dies, or you can modify your body to regenerate after death from mortal wounds. This immortality may change your base species, such as if you become a lich or move your body into a flesh golem. If it does, you retain all benefits and modifiers from your original species other than size and gain the effects of the new species in addition.

        \parhead{Progression} You must discover powerful new magic rituals that support your particular form of immortality. This generally requires exploring sites of ancient magic, gaining favor with powerful creatures who have relevant knowledge or abilities, and independent experimentation based on your findings.

        \subsubsection{Artifical Immortality Ranks}

            \parhead{Rank 1 -- Life After Death} If you die from any cause other than old age, you resurrect according to nature of your chosen immortality. Your specific form of immortality determines where you return, such as at the site of your death, at the current location of your corpse, or in an entirely separate location. The timing of your resurrection may also differ based on your immortality, but you cannot complete your resurrection sooner than one day after the time of your death. After you resurrect in this way, this ability does not function for one week, allowing you to be killed normally.

            \parhead{Rank 2 -- Death Familiarity} You become so familiar with the trauma of injury and death that your body adapts to it.
            You gain a \plus2 bonus to vital rolls.
            In addition, you cannot gain more than two vital wounds from a single damage roll, regardless of the amount of damage you take.

            \parhead{Rank 3 -- Artificial Life} Whenever you resurrect with your \textit{life after death} ability, your new body gains a \plus1 bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. This bonus does not stack if you resurrect multiple times. In addition, that resurrection functions even if the cause of your death was old age, and you can control the physical age of your new body.

            \parhead{Rank 4 -- Deathcaller} You are deeply familiar with death, and know how to most effectively inflict it on others.
            Whenever you inflict a \glossterm{vital wound} on a living creature, you may kill that creature outright.

            \parhead{Rank 5 -- True Immortality} You become fully immortal. There is no time limit after the resurrection from your \textit{life after death} ability where you become vulnerable to a true death. In addition, the resurrection can complete as quickly as the end of the next round after your death. If a physical component limits your immortality, such as a phylactery, it can no longer be damaged or destroyed without the direct intervention of a rank 5 Slayer.

    \subsection{Deity}
        People have begun to worship you, putting you on the path to become a deity.
        As your followers grow, you become capable of ever greater miraculous acts, and you can grant your followers some of your power.
        Eventually, you ascend into the pantheon of gods.

        \parhead{Prerequisites} You must have at least a hundred sentient worshippers to choose this epic fate.
        In addition, you must not have any cleric archetypes.

        \parhead{Progression} To progress towards this epic fate, you must gain a significant number of additional worshippers.
        In general, you must at least double your worshippers to progress towards each new rank of this fate, though this can vary widely.
        Having worshippers among many different places is more valuable than converting an isolated group to worship you, though both are helpful.

        \subsubsection{Deity Ranks}
            \parhead{Rank 1 -- Domain Influence} Choose a cleric domain.
            You gain all abilities from that domain except for its mastery ability.
            In addition, your worshippers become eligible to gain cleric archetypes, though they cannot exceed a maximum rank in those archetypes of twice your rank in this epic fate (to a maximum of 8).
            This does not grant additional archetypes to worshippers who have already chosen their three archetypes, and is usually only relevant to NPC worshippers.

            \parhead{Rank 2 -- Prayers} You hear all prayers directed to you.
            Once per week, you can teleport yourself and up to ten \glossterm{allies} any distance within the same plane as a \glossterm{standard action}.
            Your destination must either be a worshipper actively praying to you or a holy place dedicated to you.
            In addition, choose a second cleric domain.
            You gain all abilities from that domain except for its mastery ability.

            \parhead{Rank 3 -- Domain Mastery} Choose a third cleric domain.
            You gain all abilities from that domain.
            In addition, you gain the mastery ability from the domains you chose with your \textit{domain influence} and \textit{prayers} abilities.

            \parhead{Rank 4 -- Demigod} You become a demigod.
            You no longer age normally, and you cannot die from old age.
            You become a \glossterm{planeforged} native to an Aligned Plane matching your alignment (see \pcref{Planes}).
            While you are on that plane, you can teleport to any plane with your \textit{prayers} ability from this epic fate.
            In addition, you can use that teleportation ability once per hour instead of once per week.

            \parhead{Rank 5 -- Deification} You become a deity.
            You are transported to an Aligned Plane matching your alignment, and you gain divine dominion over an amount of territory in that plane.
            While you are in your territory, you can can freely reshape your territory with a thought to match your desires, and you are immune to all damage and \glossterm{conditions}.

            Regardless of which plane you are on, you can teleport to anywhere within your home plane as a \glossterm{standard action}.
            In addition, there is no limit on the number of times you can teleport with your \textit{prayers} ability from this epic fate.

    \subsection{Hero of Legend}
        You are widely known as a hero, rescuing those in need.
        As your deeds of heroism spread, you gain abilities to help you protect others.
        Although you will eventually die, your legend will live on, inspiring others to save people as you did.

        \parhead{Prerequisites} You must be publicly known to be involved with saving at least one major country or similarly large group of people from some sort of disaster to choose this epic fate.
        In addition, you must have a Willpower of at least 1.

        \parhead{Progression} To progress towards this epic fate, you must publicly contribute to saving large numbers of people from death or other major disasters in a way that builds your reputation.

        \subsubsection{Hero of Legend Ranks}
            \parhead{Rank 1 -- Heroic Intervention} At the start of each phase, you may choose an \glossterm{ally} adjacent to you.
            Whenever that creature would be the target of an attack that phase, you are targeted by that attack instead.
            If the attack would have targeted both you and that ally, the attack only targets you once, not twice.

            \parhead{Rank 2 -- Unstoppable Hero} You gain a \plus4 bonus to all defenses, and you gain a \plus50 bonus to your maximum \glossterm{hit points}.
            In addition, you gain a \plus20 foot bonus to your speed with all of your \glossterm{movement modes}.

            \parhead{Rank 3 -- Sheltering Aura} Your \textit{heroic intervention} ability from this epic fate affects any number of \glossterm{allies} within a \areamed radius \glossterm{emanation} from you.
            Whenever an affected ally is attacked, you teleport into an empty space next to that creature, or into its space if no empty space is available.
            If multiple allies are attacked simultaneously, you can choose where you end up at the end of the series of teleportations.

            \parhead{Rank 4 -- Inspiring Hero} The area of your \textit{heroic intervention} ability increases to a \areagarg radius \glossterm{emanation}.
            In addition, each creature with a mind affected by that ability is so inspired by your example that it gains a \plus1 bonus to its Willpower permanently.
            This bonus does not stack.

            \parhead{Rank 5 -- Answer the Call} You gain an intuitive sense for when people need your aid.
            Whenever someone on the same plane as you is in danger, you are aware of the existence of that danger.
            You can sense the general category of danger (fire, combat, drowning, etc.) and a very approximate direction and distance.
            This generally allows you to sense if a large number of people are in danger from the same thing.
            As a \glossterm{standard action}, you can teleport any distance within that plane to reach a person in danger.

    \subsection{Slayer}
        You are widely known as a killer of legendary skill.
        As your body count increases, you gain abilities to help you track down and kill increasingly powerful foes.
        Eventually, your powers threaten the gods themselves, allowing you a unique ability to transcend death.

        \parhead{Prerequisites} You must be publicly known to be involved with slaying at least one creature with a challenge rating of 4 and a level of at least 21.

        \parhead{Progression} To progress towards this epic fate, you must publicly contribute to slaying increasingly dangerous and fearsome foes in a way that builds your reputation.

        \subsubsection{Slayer Ranks}
            \parhead{Rank 1 -- Lethality} You gain a \plus4 bonus to \glossterm{power}.
            In addition, whenever you would inflict any number of \glossterm{vital wounds} on a creature, you may inflict twice that many vital wounds.

            \parhead{Rank 2 -- Precision Killer} You gain a \plus4 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy}.
            In addition, you can inflict \glossterm{critical hits} on creatures that would otherwise be immune to critical hits from you due to their size or body structure.

            \parhead{Rank 3 -- Mark of the Slayer} As a \glossterm{standard action}, you can choose to mark any creature you can unambiguously identify.
            This includes any creature you can see, as well as any creature you know the name of and can differentiate from other similar creatures.
            You can only mark one creature at a time, and applying a new mark replaces any previous mark.
            You cannot use this ability to replace a mark that is less than a week old if the recipient of the previous mark still lives.

            This mark is visible on the creature's body with a design that is recognizably yours.
            It appears on top of any clothing or other attempt to conceal it, even if the creature is invisible.
            Anyone can recognize the significance of the mark with a \glossterm{difficulty value} 15 Knowledge (arcana or local) check, and creatures that understand the significance of the mark may refuse to give your target aid of any kind to avoid risking your wrath.

            You know the exact distance and direction to any creature you have marked with this ability that is on the same plane as you.
            As a \glossterm{standard action}, you can create a \glossterm{scrying sensor} adjacent to them that you can see and hear through.
            The sensor lasts as long as you \glossterm{sustain} it as a \glossterm{free action}.
            It moves to stay adjacent to the target, regardless of its speed.

            \parhead{Rank 4 -- Slayer's Journey} As a \glossterm{standard action}, you can \glossterm{teleport} yourself and up to ten \glossterm{allies} any distance within the same plane to the location of a creature affected by your \textit{mark of the slayer} ability from this epic fate.
            You cannot precisely choose the destination of this ability, and it does not leave you immediately adjacent to the marked creature.
            Generally, it leaves you just outside any sort of fortress or defenses the marked creature has constructed.
            After you use this ability, you cannot use it to travel to the same creature for a day.
            This does not limit your ability to travel to a different creature if you mark a different creature.

            \parhead{Rank 5 -- Godslayer}
            Your attacks ignore most forms of general immunity.
            This does not help you ignore specific immunities, such as fire elemental's immunity to fire damage.
            However, you can destroy artifacts and even inflict damage and conditions on deities in their divine dominion.
            As a result, even deities fear to interfere with you directly.
            If you ever die, you can generally threaten or fight your way past any planar guardians to leave your afterlife whenever you want.
            After you do this once, you become a \glossterm{planeforged} native to your afterlife plane, since your new body is formed from the raw material of that plane (see \pcref{Planes}).

            They can wear armor, but it is treated as barding instead of normal armor, increasing its cost.
            In general, dragon-fitted barding is rare or nonexistent even in large cities, so a dragon's armor must usually be created specifically for them.

    \subsection{Drakkenfel}

        A drakkenfel is created when a dragon's scales are removed while the dragon still lives. The scales retain much of the dragon's power, and without them, the dragon is cursed to continue its life as a diminished, mortal creature.
        Drakkenfel are extremely rare, as there are few who are powerful enough to subdue a dragon to extract its scales -- and fewer still who would dare to do so, knowing that they would earn the eternal enmity of dragonkind.

        Physically, a drakkenfel resembles a wyrmling dragon, except that it is completely scaleless.
        Its skin is leathery and rough, and some drakkenfel bear scars from the ritual that removed their scales.
        Most drakkenfel retain tatters of their wings, but they are always nonfunctional.

                When creating a drakkenfel, choose which type of dragon it used to be.
                This is inherent to the drakkenfel, and cannot be changed.
                A list of dragons and their associated energy type is given on \tref{Dragon Types}.
            \itemhead{Damage Tolerance} A drakkenfel is \trait{impervious} to damage of the type associated with its \textit{draconic essence}.
            \itemhead{Low-light Vision} Drakkenfel have \trait{low-light vision}, allowing them to see clearly in \glossterm{shadowy illumination} (see \pcref{Low-light Vision}).

    \subsection{Drow}

        Drow are an offshoot group of elves that live deep underground.
        The deep caves are a far harsher environment than the surface world.
        Resources are scarce, and dangerous monsters are far more common.
        In order to survive, drow were forced to adopt a variety of practices condemned by surface civilizations.
        The most notorious are their frequent use of poison, their refusal to take prisoners, their willingness to eat any non-drow creatures they kill, even sentient creatures.
        In addition, drow society tends to reward selfishness and ambition more explicitly than surface civilizations, and the vast majority of drow are evil.

        When drow find opportunities to reach the surface world, they seek to conquer territory for themselves, usually with great violence.
        They have always been defeated and banished back to their caves, but surface civilizations still remember the danger that drow pose.
        Even more so than tieflings or orcs, who are already viewed with suspicion, drow are anathema in almost any civilized society.
        Drow who escape the deep caves are more likely to find a peaceful existence on other planes that do not fear an underground invasion.

    \subsection{Oozeborn}
        Oozeborn are sentient ooze creatures that have gained true sentience through a strange quirk of their birth.
        They are very rare to see in civilized lands, as most oozeborn lack the opportunity to discover more than the dark caves in which they were spawned.
        Since they often grow up without mentorship from any civilized creature, oozeborn tend to have odd mannerisms and a poor ability to mask their emotions, even after spending years in civilization.
        Old oozeborn may eventually adapt to societal norms and act perfectly natural, or they may abandon civilized company entirely.

        The body of an oozeborn is amorphous, and they lack any identifiable internal organs.
        Their natural color depends on the nature of the ooze that spawned them, so green and gray are the most common colors.
        Adventuring oozeborn typically assume a bipedal shape for both practical and social convenience, but their natural shape is a loosely spherical blob.
        Unconscious oozeborn revert to their default state automatically, though some learn to maintain a semblance of cohesion while asleep.

        \subsubsection{Oozeborn Archetype}
            \cf{Ooz}[0]{Acid Tolerance} You are \trait{impervious} to acid damage.
            \cf{Ooz}[0]{Amorphous Form} You gain a \plus5 bonus to the Flexibility skill (see \pcref{Flexibility}).
                Your natural form is a loosely spherical blob.
                You can use the \ability{mold body} ability as a standard action to adopt a particular shape.
                \begin{durationability}{Mold Body}[\abilitytag{Sustain} (free)]
                    You make a Disguise check to alter your appearance (see \pcref{Disguise Creature}).
                    This physically changes your body to match the results of your disguise.
                    You gain a \plus4 bonus on the check, and you ignore penalties for changing your gender, species, subtype, age, and number of limbs (up to 4).
                    However, this effect is unable to alter your equipment in any way.

                    You can sustain this ability for any length of time without mental strain, ignoring the normal 5 minute limit.
                \end{durationability}
            \cf{Ooz}[0]{Compressible Body} You can compress your head and shoulders down to a minimum of a one inch radius, allowing you to squeeze through very small areas.
                Your clothing or armor is not compressed, so they may limit your ability to move through extremely narrow spaces.
            \cf{Ooz}[0]{Darkvision} You have \trait{darkvision} with a 60 foot range, allowing you to see in complete darkness (see \pcref{Darkvision}).

            \cf{Ooz}[1]{Acidic Body} You gain a slam \glossterm{natural weapon}, which deals 1d8 damage and requires a free hand to use (see \pcref{Natural Weapons}).
            In addition, all damage you deal with natural weapons, including your unarmed attack, is acid damage in addition to its other types.
            This does not affect damage you deal with manufactured weapons.

            \cf{Ooz}[1]{Poison Dissolution} You are \trait{impervious} to poisons.

            \cf{Ooz}[2]{Darkborn Senses} You gain \trait{blindsense} with a 60 foot range, allowing you to sense your surroundings without light (see \pcref{Blindsense}).
            If you already have the blindsense ability, you increase its range by 60 feet.
            In addition, you gain \glossterm{blindsight} with a 15 foot range, allowing you to see without light (see \pcref{Blindsight}).
            If you already have the blindsight ability, you increase its range by 15 feet.

            \cf{Ooz}[2]{Ingest Object} You can use the \textit{ingest object} ability as a standard action.
            This functions like the \spell{absorb object} spell, except that you do not gain the ability to absorb objects that are larger than Medium size.
            Anything you absorb in this way takes a single point of acid damage at the end of each round while it remains absorbed.
            This damage is insufficient to hurt most objects made from wood, stone, or metal, but it can destroy more fragile objects like paper or complex traps.

            \cf{Ooz}[3]{Greater Amorphous Form} You gain a \plus4 bonus to your defenses when determining whether a \glossterm{strike} gets a \glossterm{critical hit} against you instead of a normal hit.

            \cf{Ooz}[3]{Greater Compressible Body} You reduce your penalties for \squeezing by 1.

            \cf{Ooz}[4]{Greater Acidic Body} You gain a \plus1d damage bonus with natural weapons.

            \cf{Ooz}[4]{Acidic Apotheosis} You are \trait{immune} to acid damage and poisons.

            \cf{Ooz}[5]{Greater Darkborn Senses} The range of your \trait{blindsense} increases by 60 feet.
            In addition, the range of your \trait{blindsight} increases by 15 feet.

            \cf{Ooz}[5]{Greater Ingest Object} The maximum number of objects you can absorb with your \textit{ingest object} ability increases to 2.
            In addition, you may absorb \glossterm{allies} with that ability in addition to unattended objects.

            \cf{Ooz}[6]{Supreme Amorphous Form} The bonus from your \textit{greater amorphous form} ability increases to \plus8.
            In addition, your \ability{mold body} ability loses the \abilitytag{Sustain} (free) tag.
            Instead, it lasts until you choose to \glossterm{dismiss} it as a \glossterm{free action}.
            This allows you to maintain your shape while unconscious.

            \cf{Ooz}[6]{Supreme Compressible Body} You reduce your penalties for squeezing by 2, which means you take no penalties for squeezing unless you use the \ability{tight squeeze} ability (see \pcref{Flexibility}).

            \cf{Ooz}[7]{Supreme Acidic Body} The bonus from your \textit{greater acidic body} ability increases to \plus2d.

            \cf{Ooz}[7]{Third Arm} When you use your \ability{mold body} ability, you can create three arms instead of two.
            You can use all three hands as free hands.
            For example, this can allow you to use a heavy weapon and a shield simultaneously.

        \subsubsection{Basic Class Abilities}
            If you choose oozeborn as your base class, you gain the following abilities.

            \cf{Ooz}{Defenses}

                \item A \plus4 bonus to your \glossterm{fatigue tolerance}, which makes it easier for you to use powerful abilities that fatigue you (see \pcref{Fatigue}).

            \cf{Ooz}{Armor Proficiencies} 
            You are proficient with light armor.
            However, you cannot wear armor unless you sustain your \ability{mold body} ability, so you cannot wear armor while sleeping.

            \cf{Ooz}{Skills}
            You have the following \glossterm{class skills}:
            \begin{itemize}

                \item \subparhead{Other} Intimidate.
            \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Tieflings}

        Tieflings are humanoid creatures descended from fiends.
        They inherit a tendency towards evil from their ancestors, and are therefore viewed with great suspicion by most civilized societies.
        Good-aligned tieflings exist, but they may have difficulty using their natural talents for subterfuge and deceit for noble ends, and they often struggle with hidden vices.

        \parhead{Size} Medium.
        \parhead{Attributes} No change.
        \parhead{Speed} 30 feet.
        \parhead{Special Abilities}

            \itemhead{Darkvision} Tieflings have \trait{darkvision} with a 60 foot range, allowing them to see in complete darkness (see \pcref{Darkvision}).
            \itemhead{Demonic Prejudice} Most people have negative associations with tieflings thanks to the malign influence that demons have on the world.
                Tieflings have an Opposition relationship with most people that they meet, which influences people's behavior and makes Persuasion checks harder (see \pcref{Persuasion}).
                People in some locations, such as the Abyss, do not have this attitude.
            \itemhead{Hellfire Tolerance} Tieflings are \trait{impervious} to fire damage.
            \itemhead{Infernal Presence} Tieflings gain a \plus2 bonus to the Deception and Intimidate skills.
            \itemhead{Tiefling Archetype} You may choose three class archetypes, as normal.
                However, you may choose the Tiefling archetype in place of one of your class archetypes.
                If you do, you gain ranks in it just like you gain ranks in class archetypes.
                You cannot choose tiefling as your base class.
        \end{itemize}
        \parhead{Automatic Languages} Abyssal, Common, any one \glossterm{common language}.

                You teleport horizontally into an unoccupied location within \shortrange on a stable surface that can support your weight.
                If the destination is invalid, this spell fails with no effect.
                In addition, make an attack vs. Reflex against each \glossterm{enemy} adjacent to your location after you arrive.
                \hit Each target takes 1d4 \add half power fire damage.
                \rankline

                        Any act by you or by creatures that appear to be your allies that threatens or harms the charmed person breaks the effect.
                        Harming the target is not limited to dealing it damage, but also includes causing it significant subjective discomfort.
                        An observant target may interpret overt threats to its allies as a threat to itself.
                        \crit Actions which threaten the charmed person without harming them do not break the effect.

            \cf{Tif}[3]{Abysswalker} You can use your \ability{abyssal hop} ability to teleport as a move action instead of as a standard action.
            When you do, you do not deal fire damage at your destination, and you \glossterm{briefly} cannot use that ability as a move action again.

            \cf{Tif}[4]{Greater Infernal Ancestry} The benefits of your \textit{infernal ancestry} ability improve.

\section{Classes}
    \subsection{Bard}
        A bard is a rogue with the ability to perform magical feats through music.
        It is unclear whether bards actually draw power from music in the same way that druids draw power from nature, or whether they simply channel their innate magical talent through music.
        The bard class functions like the rogue class, with the following exceptions:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A bard cannot choose the \textit{assassin} archetype. However, the \textit{arcane magic} sorcerer archetype is considered to be part of their class, and they may choose that archetype without spending insight points to multiclass.
            \item A bard casts spells without \glossterm{somatic components}.
            \item A bard can only cast spells while sustaining a performance with the Perform skill. This performance can be either a mundane performance or a \textit{bardic performance} ability.
        \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Faebonder}
        A faebonder is a warlock who made their pact with a fae creature instead of a demon.
        The faebonder class functions like the warlock class, with the following exceptions:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The magic source for the faebonder class is nature magic instead of pact magic.
                This changes the \glossterm{mystic spheres} a faebonder has access to and all other effects based on their source of magic.
                However, they still require both \glossterm{verbal components} and \glossterm{somatic components} to cast spells from the faebonder class (see \pcref{Casting Components}).
            \item A faebonder cannot choose the \textit{blessings of the abyss} archetype. However, the \textit{elementalist} druid archetype is considered to be part of their class, and they may choose that archetype without spending insight points to multiclass.
            \item Faebonders add Knowledge (nature) to their class skill list and remove Knowledge (planes).
        \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Favored Soul}
        A favored soul is a warlock who made their pact with a deity instead of a demon.
        This is an unusual arrangement, as deities would normally influence their clerics to achieve their aims.
        However, in special circumstances, a deity may want to empower a non-worshipper to influence mortal affairs.
        The favored soul class functions like the warlock class, with the following exceptions:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The magic source for the favored soul class is divine magic instead of pact magic.
                This changes the \glossterm{mystic spheres} a favored soul has access to and all other effects based on their source of magic.
                However, they still require both \glossterm{verbal components} and \glossterm{somatic components} to cast spells from the favored soul class (see \pcref{Casting Components}).
            \item A favored soul cannot choose the \textit{blessings of the abyss} archetype. However, the \textit{domain influence} cleric archetype is considered to be part of their class, and they may choose that archetype without spending insight points to multiclass.
            \item Favored souls add Knowledge (religion) to their class skill list and remove Knowledge (planes).
        \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Shaman}
        A shaman, like a cleric, is a divine worshipper.
        However, while clerics worship powerful, well-established deities, shamans worship more primitive deities of lesser power.
        As a result, their divine powers are more limited and take different forms.
        Shamans are common among less civilized humanoid societies like bugbears.
        The shaman class functions like the cleric class, with the following exceptions:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The magic source for the shaman class is nature magic instead of divine magic.
                This changes the \glossterm{mystic spheres} a shaman has access to and all other effects based on their source of magic.
            \item A shaman cannot choose the \textit{divine spell mastery} archetype. However, the \textit{elementalist} druid archetype is considered to be part of their class, and they may choose that archetype without spending insight points to multiclass.
            \item A shaman cannot gain access to more than two \textit{mystic spheres} from the magic source granted by the shaman class by any means.
            \item Shamans add Knowledge (nature) to their class skill list and remove Knowledge (planes).
        \end{itemize}

    \section{Feat Descriptions}

    \begin{feat}{Naiad Heritage}{Bloodline}
        \featpre Naiadi species.

        \ff[1]{Water Bond}[Magical] You can form a bond with a fresh stream, lake, or other Gargantuan or larger body of fresh water (not salt water).
        Forming a bond or severing a bond takes one week of meditation and ritual, periodically interrupted by rest.
        Forming a bond also requires asking permission from the water.
        Any individual body of water can only be bonded to one naiad or naiadi in this way.

        As long as your bonded water remains clean, pure, and large enough to be a valid subject of bonding, you gain a \plus1 bonus to Mental defense and a bonus to your maximum \glossterm{hit points} equal to your level.
        If your bonded water becomes contaminated or shrinks below the minimum size, you take a \minus1 penalty to Mental defense and a penalty to your maximum hit points equal to your level until you sever the bond.
        You can passively observe the general health and status of water you are bonded to, including knowing when significant pollutants enter the water and when the water grows or shrinks significantly.

        \ff[3]{Greater Enchanting Appearance} The bonuses from your \textit{enchanting appearance} species ability increase to \plus4.

        \ff[6]{Aqueous Form}[Magical] You can cast the \spell{aqueous form} spell.
        When you do, you do not require verbal or somatic \glossterm{casting components}, and your spellcasting rank is considered to be equal to your rank in your highest rank archetype.

        \ff[6]{Freshwater Fountain}[Magical] The volume of water you can create with the \spell{create water} cantrip increases by five times.

        \ff[9]{Greater Water Bond}[Magical] The bonus to Mental defense from your \textit{water bond} ability increases to \plus2.

        \ff[12]{Supreme Enchanting Appearance} The bonuses from your \textit{enchanting appearance} species ability increase to \plus6.

        \ff[15]{Fluidseeker}[Magical] You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} against creatures significantly composed of water or watery fluids.
        This is true of almost all living creatures.

        \ff[18]{Supreme Water Bond}[Magical] The number of hit points granted by your \textit{water bond} ability increases to twice your level, and the bonus to Mental defense increases to \plus3.

        \ff[21]{Greater Aqueous Form} When you cast the \spell{aqueous form} spell, it does not have the \abilitytag{Attune} (self) tag.
        Instead, it lasts until you \glossterm{dismiss} it as a \glossterm{free action}.
        In addition, it does not reduce your \glossterm{damage resistance}.
    \end{feat}

\section{Alternate Play Styles}
    \subsection{Tap Out}
        With this optional rule, whenever you gain a vital wound, you can ``tap out'' to guarantee that you survive while taking your character out of the fight.
        If you tap out, you treat the result of the vital roll for that vital wound as a 10, regardless of any bonuses or penalties you would normally have to the vital roll.
        However, you fall unconscious immediately, and you cannot regain consciousness by any means until you take a \glossterm{short rest}.

        This optional rule significantly reduces the likelihood of character death, and makes fights less likely to impose long-term consequences on characters.
        However, it also makes vital wounds more likely to entirely knock characters out of a fight, which can increase the risk that the entire party is defeated.


    \subsection{Being Surrounded}\label{Being Surrounded}
        With this optional rule, you can make positioning more important in combat.
        This generally has the downside of making movement more complicated, however, as combatants try to surround others and avoid being surrounded themselves.

        When you are being attacked by multiple foes at once, you are less able to defend yourself.
        If every space adjacent to you either contains an \glossterm{enemy} or is adjacent to an \glossterm{enemy}, you are surrounded.
        A creature that is surrounded takes a \minus2 penalty to its Armor and Reflex defenses.
        When determining whether you are surrounded, ignore any enemies that are sharing space with you, and ignore any enemies that are at least two size categories smaller than you.

        Any effect that makes a creature immune to being \partiallyunaware, such as the \spell{foresight} spell, also makes that creature immune to being surrounded.

    \subsection{Obscure Magic Items}\label{Obscure Magic Items}
        The base rules of Rise make it fairly easy to identify magic items.
        This keeps the pace of the game up when players find magic items frequently.
        However, you may choose to treat magic items as being more rare and mysterious.
        If you do, make the following changes:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The \ability{identify item} ability from the Craft and Knowledge skills provides no information about how to use a magic item's properties or what they might be.
                It can still be used to identify whether or not an item is magical.
            \item The Knowledge (items) Knowledge skill is removed entirely.
            \item Magic items are more rare, and therefore more valuable.
                Calculate the prices for all magic items as if they were one rank higher than they actually are.
                Rank 7 magic items cannot be bought for any price - they are simply too rare.
            \item All spells with the \glossterm{Attune} (self) and \glossterm{Attune} (target) tags require two attunement points to attune to instead of only one.
                If magic items are hard to find and use, spellcasters gain a powerful benefit, since their personal attunement spells are still reliably available.
                This change ensures that spellcasters still gain a benefit from their personal access to magic, but they are not drastically more powerful than characters who depend on finding useful magic items.
        \end{itemize}

        You may also want to add complex or unintuitive activation conditions to magic items.
        For example, \mitem{boots of speed} may only function while hopping on one foot, or while you are not wearing socks.
        This can encourage players to experiment more with magic items to figure out how to use them.

    \subsubsection{Restricted Archetype Order}
        Normally, when a character in Rise levels up, they can freely choose which of their class archetypes they want to rank up (as long as they don't exceed their maximum rank).
        However, this means that most levels require making a choice that may be confusing for newer players.
        The process of leveling up can be simplified if each player chooses an order for their archetypes.

        With this variant, each character has a primary archetype, a secondary archetype, and a tertiary archetype.
        This choice is made at character creation.
        Whenever they increase their maximum rank, they increase their rank in their primary archetype.
        In their next level up, they increase their rank in their secondary archetype, and then finally their tertiary archetype.
