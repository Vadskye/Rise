\chapter{Optional Rules}

\section{Attributes}

    \subsection{Other Methods of Attribute Generation}
        Point buy offers the fairest and most customizable system for determining attribute scores, ensuring that players can be almost any character they want to be. However, some groups may wish to determine attribute scores differently. Other options are provided below.

        \subsubsection{Semi-Randomized Point Buy}
            With this method, you have only a small degree of control over your attribute scores, but all characters generated in this way are equally powerful.
            As with the point buy method, all your attribute scores start at 0, and you get 11 points to distribute among your attribute scores.
            However, you do not have full control over how to distribute those points.

            Roll 4d6 for each attribute score, dropping a die of your choice with each roll. First roll for the attribute scores that you care about most, and save the least important attribute scores for last. After rolling for an attribute score, sum results on the three highest dice and consult \trefnp{Semi-Randomized Point Buy Results} and spend the appropriate number of points to yield an attribute score, as indicated by \trefnp{Attribute Score Point Costs}. If you do not have enough points remaining to spend the amount indicated by the die roll, spend as many as you can and move on to the next ability.

            If you have points remaining after rolling all of your attribute scores, you may distribute the points freely among your abilities, using the normal point buy rules. You cannot increase any attribute above 2 during this stage.

            After all of your points have been spent, you may swap any two of your attribute scores.

            \begin{dtable}
                \lcaption{Semi-Randomized Point Buy Results}
                \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{X X X}
                    \tb{Roll} & \tb{Base Attribute} & \tb{Point Cost} \tableheaderrule
                    3-4       & \minus2              & 0\fn{1} \\
                    5-7       & \minus1              & 0\fn{2} \\
                    8-11      & 0                    & 0       \\
                    12-14     & 1                    & 1       \\
                    15-16     & 2                    & 3       \\
                    16-17     & 3                    & 5       \\
                    18        & 4                    & 7       \\
                \end{dtabularx}
                1 You gain one \glossterm{insight point}. \\
                2 You gain one \glossterm{skill point}. \\
            \end{dtable}

            For characters with more extreme attribute scores, use the following approach, starting with 11 points as normal:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item For each attribute, roll 2d6
                \item Take the average, rounding down, and subtract 2 from it
                \item Spend that many points as indicated on \trefnp{Attribute Score Point Costs} until you have no points left.
            \end{enumerate}

        \subsubsection{Random Point Buy}
            This method gives you no control over your character whatsoever, while still ensuring that all characters generated are equally powerful.
            It functions like the semi-randomized point buy method, except that you also randomize the order in which the attribute scores are rolled.

        \subsubsection{Classic Hardcore}

            This method is completely random and can generate very overpowered or underpowered characters.
            It represents the unfairness of the world, where some people are just better or worse than others.
            For each attribute, roll 2d6, take the average (rounded down), and subtract 2.
            If you roll a 1 on both dice, treat the average as a 0.
            The result is your base value for that attribute.

\section{Epic Fate}
    After 21st level, characters no longer gain levels normally.
    However, they can still increase their personal power as they make progress towards their ultimate fate.

    When you reach 21st level, you may choose an epic fate that you qualify for, or you may delay choosing until you meet the prerequisites for your desired fate.
    You do not start with any ranks in you chosen epic fate.
    Each epic fate specifies ways that you can make progress towards that epic fate.
    Whenever you make dramatic progress towards your epic fate, your rank in that epic fate may increase, at the discretion of the Game Master.

    None of the epic fate abilities have a tag to indicate that they are \glossterm{magical} abilities.
    Many of them are not fundamentally \glossterm{mundane} in nature, but they are beyond normal magic, and effects like an \spell{antimagic field} cannot interact with or suppress them.

    \subsection{Artificial Immortality}
        You have sought out strange magical power in search of a way to artificially prolong your life.
        As your power grows, you become increasingly able to resist death and return from it.
        Eventually, you will transcend death entirely.

        \parhead{Prerequisites} You must perform a series of rituals to prepare yourself for immortality, at least one of which must be rank 7 or higher. There are many kinds of immortality that you can pursue with this epic fate, and the exact nature of the rituals will change depending on the type of immortality you pursue. For example, you can have a phylactery regenerate a new body for you like a lich, you can create clones of yourself that you inhabit if your first body dies, or you can modify your body to regenerate after death from mortal wounds. This immortality may change your base species, such as if you become a lich or move your body into a flesh golem. If it does, you retain all benefits and modifiers from your original species other than size and gain the effects of the new species in addition.

        \parhead{Progression} You must discover powerful new magic rituals that support your particular form of immortality. This generally requires exploring sites of ancient magic, gaining favor with powerful creatures who have relevant knowledge or abilities, and independent experimentation based on your findings.

        \subsubsection{Artifical Immortality Ranks}

            \parhead{Rank 1 -- Life After Death} If you die from any cause other than old age, you resurrect according to nature of your chosen immortality. Your specific form of immortality determines where you return, such as at the site of your death, at the current location of your corpse, or in an entirely separate location. The timing of your resurrection may also differ based on your immortality, but you cannot complete your resurrection sooner than one day after the time of your death. After you resurrect in this way, this ability does not function for one week, allowing you to be killed normally.

            \parhead{Rank 2 -- Death Familiarity} You become so familiar with the trauma of injury and death that your body adapts to it. You gain a \plus2 bonus to vital rolls, and you can no longer become bloodied.

            \parhead{Rank 3 -- Artificial Life} Whenever you resurrect with your \textit{life after death} ability, your new body gains a \plus1 bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. This bonus does not stack if you resurrect multiple times. In addition, that resurrection functions even if the cause of your death was old age, and you can control the physical age of your new body.

            \parhead{Rank 4 -- Deathcaller} You are deeply familiar with death, and know how to most effectively inflict it on others.
            Whenever you inflict a \glossterm{vital wound} on a living creature, you may kill that creature outright.

            \parhead{Rank 5 -- True Immortality} You become fully immortal. There is no time limit after the resurrection from your \textit{life after death} ability where you become vulnerable to a true death. In addition, the resurrection can complete as quickly as the end of the next round after your death. If a physical component limits your immortality, such as a phylactery, it can no longer be damaged or destroyed without the direct intervention of a rank 5 Slayer.

    \subsection{Deity}
        People have begun to worship you, putting you on the path to become a deity.
        As your followers grow, you become capable of ever greater miraculous acts, and you can grant your followers some of your power.
        Eventually, you ascend into the pantheon of gods.

        \parhead{Prerequisites} You must have at least a hundred sentient worshippers to choose this epic fate.
        In addition, you must not have any cleric archetypes.

        \parhead{Progression} To progress towards this epic fate, you must gain a significant number of additional worshippers.
        In general, you must at least double your worshippers to progress towards each new rank of this fate, though this can vary widely.
        Having worshippers among many different places is more valuable than converting an isolated group to worship you, though both are helpful.

        \subsubsection{Deity Ranks}
            \parhead{Rank 1 -- Domain Influence} Choose a cleric domain.
            You gain all abilities from that domain except for its mastery ability.
            In addition, your worshippers become eligible to gain cleric archetypes, though they cannot exceed a maximum rank in those archetypes of twice your rank in this epic fate (to a maximum of 8).
            This does not grant additional archetypes to worshippers who have already chosen their three archetypes, and is usually only relevant to NPC worshippers.

            \parhead{Rank 2 -- Prayers} You hear all prayers directed to you.
            Once per week, you can teleport yourself and up to ten \glossterm{allies} any distance within the same plane as a \glossterm{standard action}.
            Your destination must either be a worshipper actively praying to you or a holy place dedicated to you.
            In addition, choose a second cleric domain.
            You gain all abilities from that domain except for its mastery ability.

            \parhead{Rank 3 -- Domain Mastery} Choose a third cleric domain.
            You gain all abilities from that domain.
            In addition, you gain the mastery ability from the domains you chose with your \textit{domain influence} and \textit{prayers} abilities.

            \parhead{Rank 4 -- Demigod} You become a demigod.
            You no longer age normally, and you cannot die from old age.
            You become an \glossterm{planeforged} native to an Aligned Plane matching your alignment (see \pcref{Planes}).
            While you are on that plane, you can teleport to any plane with your \textit{prayers} ability from this epic fate.
            In addition, you can use that teleportation ability once per hour instead of once per week.

            \parhead{Rank 5 -- Deification} You become a deity.
            You are transported to an Aligned Plane matching your alignment, and you gain divine dominion over an amount of territory in that plane.
            While you are in your territory, you can can freely reshape your territory with a thought to match your desires, and you are immune to all damage and \glossterm{conditions}.

            Regardless of which plane you are on, you can teleport to anywhere within your home plane as a \glossterm{standard action}.
            In addition, there is no limit on the number of times you can teleport with your \textit{prayers} ability from this epic fate.

    \subsection{Hero of Legend}
        You are widely known as a hero, rescuing those in need.
        As your deeds of heroism spread, you gain abilities to help you protect others.
        Although you will eventually die, your legend will live on, inspiring others to save people as you did.

        \parhead{Prerequisites} You must be publicly known to be involved with saving at least one major country or similarly large group of people from some sort of disaster to choose this epic fate.
        In addition, you must have a base Willpower of at least 1.

        \parhead{Progression} To progress towards this epic fate, you must publicly contribute to saving large numbers of people from death or other major disasters in a way that builds your reputation.

        \subsubsection{Hero of Legend Ranks}
            \parhead{Rank 1 -- Heroic Intervention} At the start of each phase, you may choose an \glossterm{ally} adjacent to you.
            Whenever that creature would be the target of an attack that phase, you are targeted by that attack instead.
            If the attack would have targeted both you and that ally, the attack only targets you once, not twice.

            \parhead{Rank 2 -- Unstoppable Hero} You gain a \plus4 bonus to all defenses, and you increase your maximum \glossterm{hit points} by 4.
            In addition, you gain a \plus20 foot bonus to your \glossterm{base speed}.

            \parhead{Rank 3 -- Sheltering Aura} Your \textit{heroic intervention} ability from this epic fate affects any number of \glossterm{allies} within a \areamed radius \glossterm{emanation} from you.
            Whenever an affected ally is attacked, you teleport into an empty space next to that creature, or into its space if no empty space is available.
            If multiple allies are attacked simultaneously, you can choose where you end up at the end of the series of teleportations.

            \parhead{Rank 4 -- Inspiring Hero} The area of your \textit{heroic intervention} ability increases to a \areaext radius \glossterm{emanation}.
            In addition, each creature with a mind affected by that ability is so inspired by your example that they gain a \plus1 bonus to their base Willpower permanently.

            \parhead{Rank 5 -- Answer the Call} You gain an intuitive sense for when people need your aid.
            Whenever someone on the same plane as you is in danger, you are aware of the existence of that danger.
            You can sense the general category of danger (fire, combat, drowning, etc.) and a very approximate direction and distance.
            This generally allows you to sense if a large number of people are in danger from the same thing.
            As a \glossterm{standard action}, you can teleport any distance within that plane to reach a person in danger.

    \subsection{Slayer}
        You are widely known as a killer of legendary skill.
        As your body count increases, you gain abilities to help you track down and kill increasingly powerful foes.
        Eventually, your powers threaten the gods themselves, allowing you a unique ability to transcend death.

        \parhead{Prerequisites} You must be publicly known to be involved with slaying at least one creature with a challenge rating of 4 and a level of at least 21.

        \parhead{Progression} To progress towards this epic fate, you must publicly contribute to slaying increasingly dangerous and fearsome foes in a way that builds your reputation.

        \subsubsection{Slayer Ranks}
            \parhead{Rank 1 -- Lethality} You gain a \plus4 bonus to \glossterm{power}.
            In addition, whenever you would inflict any number of \glossterm{vital wounds} on a creature, you may inflict twice that many vital wounds.

            \parhead{Rank 2 -- Precision Killer} You gain a \plus4 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy}.
            In addition, you can inflict \glossterm{critical hits} on creatures that would otherwise be immune to critical hits from you due to their size or body structure.

            \parhead{Rank 3 -- Mark of the Slayer} As a \glossterm{standard action}, you can choose to mark any creature you can unambiguously identify.
            This includes any creature you can see, as well as any creature you know the name of and can differentiate from other similar creatures.
            You can only mark one creature at a time, and applying a new mark replaces any previous mark.
            You cannot use this ability to replace a mark that is less than a week old if the recipient of the previous mark still lives.

            This mark is visible on the creature's body with a design that is recognizably yours.
            It appears on top of any clothing or other attempt to conceal it, even if the creature is invisible.
            Anyone can recognize the significance of the mark with a \glossterm{difficulty rating} 15 Knowledge (arcana or local) check, and creatures that understand the significance of the mark may refuse to give your target aid of any kind to avoid risking your wrath.

            You know the exact distance and direction to any creature you have marked with this ability that is on the same plane as you.
            As a \glossterm{standard action}, you can create a \glossterm{scrying sensor} adjacent to them that you can see and hear through.
            The sensor lasts as long as you \glossterm{sustain} it as a \glossterm{free action}.
            It moves to stay adjacent to the target, regardless of its speed.

            \parhead{Rank 4 -- Slayer's Journey} As a \glossterm{standard action}, you can \glossterm{teleport} yourself and up to ten \glossterm{allies} any distance within the same plane to the location of a creature affected by your \textit{mark of the slayer} ability from this epic fate.
            You cannot precisely choose the destination of this ability, and it does not leave you immediately adjacent to the marked creature.
            Generally, it leaves you just outside any sort of fortress or defenses the marked creature has constructed.
            After you use this ability, you cannot use it to travel to the same creature for a day.
            This does not limit your ability to travel to a different creature if you mark a different creature.

            \parhead{Rank 5 -- Godslayer}
            Your attacks ignore most forms of general immunity.
            This does not help you ignore specific immunities, such as fire elemental's immunity to fire damage.
            However, you can destroy artifacts and even inflict damage and conditions on deities in their divine dominion.
            As a result, even deities fear to interfere with you directly.
            If you ever die, you can generally threaten or fight your way past any planar guardians to leave your afterlife whenever you want.
            After you do this once, you become an \glossterm{planeforged} native to your afterlife plane, since your new body is formed from the raw material of that plane (see \pcref{Planes}).

    \subsection{Drakkenfel}

        A drakkenfel is created when a dragon's scales are removed while the dragon still lives. The scales retain much of the dragon's power, and without them, the dragon is cursed to continue its life as a diminished, mortal creature.
        Drakkenfel are extremely rare, as there are few who are powerful enough to subdue a dragon to extract its scales -- and fewer still who would dare to do so, knowing that they would earn the eternal enmity of dragonkind.

        Physically, a drakkenfel resembles a wyrmling dragon, except that it is completely scaleless.
        Its skin is leathery and rough, and some drakkenfel bear scars from the ritual that removed their scales.
        Most drakkenfel retain tatters of their wings, but they are always nonfunctional.

        \parhead{Size} Small.
        \parhead{Attributes} No change. This replaces the normal bonuses and penalties to attributes from being Small.

        \begin{itemize}
            \itemhead*{Low-light Vision}: Drakkenfel treat sources of light as if they had double their normal illumination range.
            \itemhead{Draconic Essence} Each drakkenfel was once a type of true dragon.
                When creating a drakkenfel, choose which type of dragon it used to be.
                This is inherent to the drakkenfel, and cannot be changed.
                A list of dragons and their associated energy type is given on \tref{Dragon Types}.
            \itemhead{Damage Resistance} A drakkenfel gains a bonus equal to its level to its \glossterm{resistance} against the damage type associated with its \textit{draconic essence}.
            \itemhead{Bite} A drakkenfel's mouth can be used to bite (see \pcref{Natural Weapons}). A drakkenfel's bite attack deals \plus0d damage.
            \itemhead{Sleeping Dragon} If a drakkenfel recovers its stolen scales, it immediately becomes a true dragon again.
                Its statistics become identical to its statistics before losing its scales, including level, except that it keeps all abilities gained from its Scaleless feat while a drakkenfel.
                It does not gain additional abilities from the Scaleless feat as it gains levels.
        \end{itemize}
        \parhead{Species Feat Options} Draconic Heritage. The type of dragon chosen for the drakkenfel's \textit{draconic ancestry} must match its \textit{draconic essence}.

    \subsection{Dryaidi}

        Dryaidi are humanoid creatures that resemble plants. They are descended from dryads.

        \parhead{Size} Medium.
        \parhead{Attributes} \plus1 base Constitution, \minus1 base Dexterity.
        \parhead{Speed} 20 feet.

        \begin{itemize}
