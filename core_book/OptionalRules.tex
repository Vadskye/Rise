\section{Attributes}

    \subsection{Other Methods of Attribute Generation}
        Point buy offers the fairest and most customizable system for determining attribute scores, ensuring that players can be almost any character they want to be. However, some groups may wish to determine attribute scores differently. Other options are provided below.

        \subsubsection{Semi-Randomized Point Buy}
            With this method, you have only a small degree of control over your attribute scores, but all characters generated in this way are equally powerful.
            As with the point buy method, all your attribute scores start at 0, and you get 9 points to distribute among your attribute scores.
            However, you do not have full control over how to distribute those points.

            Roll 4d6 for each attribute score, dropping a die of your choice with each roll. First roll for the attribute scores that you care about most, and save the least important attribute scores for last. After rolling for an attribute score, sum results on the three highest dice and consult \trefnp{Semi-Randomized Point Buy Results} and spend the appropriate number of points to yield an attribute score, as indicated by \trefnp{Attribute Score Point Costs}. If you do not have enough points remaining to spend the amount indicated by the die roll, spend as many as you can and move on to the next ability.

            If you have points remaining after rolling all of your attribute scores, you may distribute the points freely among your abilities, using the normal point buy rules. You cannot increase any attribute above 3 during this stage.

            After all of your points have been spent, you may swap any two of your attribute scores.

            \begin{dtable}
                \lcaption{Semi-Randomized Point Buy Results}
                \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{X X X}
                    \tb{Roll} & \tb{Attribute Score} & \tb{Point Cost} \\
                    \bottomrule
                    3-5   & \minus2 & 0\fn{1} \\
                    6-8   & \minus1 & 0\fn{2} \\
                    9-12  & 0       & 0             \\
                    13-14 & 1       & 1             \\
                    15-16 & 2       & 2             \\
                    16-17 & 3       & 4             \\
                    18    & 4       & 6             \\
                \end{dtabularx}
                1 You gain four \glossterm{skill points}. \\
                2 You gain two skill points. \\
            \end{dtable}

            For characters with more extreme attribute scores, use the following approach, starting with 9 points as normal:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item For each attribute, roll 2d6
                \item Take the average, rounding down, and subtract 2 from it
                \item Spend that many points as indicated on \trefnp{Attribute Score Point Costs} until you have no points left.
            \end{enumerate}

        \subsubsection{Random Point Buy}
            This method gives you no control over your character whatsoever, while still ensuring that all characters generated are equally powerful. It functions as the semi-randomized point buy method, except that you also randomize the order in which the attribute scores are rolled.

        \subsubsection{Classic Hardcore}

            This method is completely random and can generate very overpowered or underpowered characters. It represents the unfairness of the world, where some people are just better or worse than others. Roll 1d6 for each attribute score and subtract 2 from each result. The result is the attribute score.

    \subsection{Drakkenfel}

        A drakkenfel is created when a dragon's scales are removed while the dragon still lives. The scales retain much of the dragon's power, and without them, the dragon is cursed to continue its life as a diminished, mortal creature.
        Drakkenfel are extremely rare, as there are few who are powerful enough to subdue a dragon to extract its scales -- and fewer still who would dare to do so, knowing that they would earn the eternal enmity of dragonkind.

        Although are drakkenfel are generally considered to be a lesser creature than true dragons, they have hidden power.
        While separated from its full draconic essence, a drakkenfel can bridge the divide between the different types of true dragons, gaining the affinity for multiple energy types and special powers.
        A drakkenfel that regains its scales retains these enhanced abilities, becoming more powerful than an ordinary dragon.
        Such a creature is called a drakkenlord.

        Physically, a drakkenfel resembles a wyrmling dragon, except that it is completely scaleless.
        Its skin is leathery and rough, and some drakkenfel bear horrific scars from the ritual that removed their scales.
        Most drakkenfel retain tatters of their wings, but they are always nonfunctional.

        \parhead{Size} Small.
        \parhead{Attributes} No change.
        \parhead{Speed} 25 feet.

                When creating a drakkenfel, choose which type of dragon it used to be.
                This is inherent to the drakkenfel, and cannot be changed.
                A list of dragons and their associated energy type is given on \tref{Dragon Types}.
            \itemhead{Energy Resistance} A drakkenfel gains damage reduction equal to five times its level against the energy type associated with its \textit{draconic essence}.
            \itemhead{Sleeping Dragon} If a drakkenfel recovers its stolen scales, it immediately becomes a true dragon again.
                Its statistics become identical to its statistics before losing its scales, including level, except that it keeps all abilities gained from its Scaleless feat while a drakkenfel.
                It does not gain additional abilities from the Scaleless feat as it gains levels.
        \end{itemize}
        \parhead{Species Bonus Feat} Scaleless.

    %         \cf{Drg}[2nd]{Draconic Wings}
    %         The half-dragon grows leathery draconic wings from his back.

    %     \cf{Drk}[3rd]{Magical Senses}
    %     The drakkenfel gains the following ability based on her innate magic.
    %     \subcf{Draconic Senses}
    %     The drakkenfel gains low-light vision, 50 foot darkvision, and 20 foot blindsense for 1 round.
    %     If she already has low-light vision, she doubles its benefit, allowing him to treat sources of light as if they had four times their normal illumination range.

    %     If she does, the following changes occur.
    %     \begin{itemize}
    %         \item Her equipment melds into her body. All physical properties of her equipment, such as armor, have no effect. However, she still gains the magical properties of her equipped items.

    %         \item She gains a \plus2 bonus to spellpower, and a \plus4 bonus to Armor defense.
    %     \end{itemize}
    %     \subcf{11th -- Draconic Size}
    %     When the drakkenfel uses her surge of power, she can increase her size by one size category.
    %     The size increase lasts as long as her surge of power does.
    %     This is a sizing effect, and does not stack with most other sizing effects.
    %     However, it stacks with the size increase from the dragonshape aspect.

    %     \subsubsection{Drakkenfel Invocations}
    %         \parhead{1st -- Breath Weapon}
    %         As a standard action, the drakkenfel makes a special attack vs. Reflex against everything within an Medium area.
    %         The shape and damage type of the drakkenfel's breath weapon depends on her draconic essence, as described in \tref{Dragon Types}.
    %         A successful attack deals 1d6 damage per spellpower.
    %         A failed attack deals half damage.
    %         \parhead{1st -- Augment Weapons}
    %         As a standard action, the drakkenfel can give her natural attacks a \plus1 enhancement bonus.
    %         This gives a \plus1 bonus to damage and grants her an additional offensive legend point for her natural attacks (see \pcref{Weapon Enhancement Bonuses}).
    %         This bonus increases by \plus1 at spellpower 4, and every 4 spellpower thereafter.
    %         \parhead{4th -- Water Breathing}
    %         As a standard action, the drakkenfel gains the ability to breathe water as if it was air for 1 hour.
