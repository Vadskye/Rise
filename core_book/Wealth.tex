\section{Wealth By Level}
    Characters can generally expect to have a certain amount of total wealth, gained through the course of their adventures. The below chart summarizes the amount of wealth a character can expect to have. This may take the form of currency, precious gems, magic items, land, or anything else of significant value. For the purpose of character wealth, magic items are considered to be worth their market price, regardless of how they were acquired.

\section{Item Levels}

    Each item has a level associated with it. This level is different from its \glossterm{power}, and has no in-game significance; instead, it represents the level of character for which the item is appropriate. Item levels are based on the price of the item, using the table below.

    \subsection{Using Item Levels}

        You can equip a character using by using a number of items of appropriate levels instead of by individually spending all of the wealth allotted to the character. To do so, give the character one item of each level, starting with the character's level and ending three levels lower, for a total of four items. If the character is lower than 4th level, add 1/2-level items as necessary to total 4 items.

        If you want more items, you can trade an item of one level for two items of a lower level.
        You can also trade two items of a lower level for an item of a higher level, but this should not be used to gain an item of a level higher than the character's level.
        Items can be traded according to the table below.
