\chapter{Classes}\label{Classes}

Your character's class represents the things your character has chosen to train in.
This choice determines a great deal about your character's abilities.

\section{How Classes Work}
    When you first create a character, you choose a class.
    Your character has one level in that class.
    This grants your character all of the abilities your chosen class grants at 1st level, as given in the class description.
    Each time your character gains a level, you can choose to increase your level in your original class or gain a level in a new class.
    This grants your character all of the abilities your chosen class grants at the level your character just gained in it.

    \subsection{Base Classes}
        Every character has one \glossterm{base class}.
        You may choose any class your character has at least one level in as a base class.
        Whenever your character gain a level, you can change its base class to a different class it has.
        Your choice of base class affects your character's \glossterm{defenses}, \glossterm{skill points}, and \glossterm{class skills}.
        In addition, every class grants additional abilities if it is chosen as a base class, as given in the class description.

\section{Class Introductions}

    There are eleven classes in Rise.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Barbarians are mighty warriors who can enter a deadly battlerage.
        \item Clerics are divine spellcasters who draw power from their veneration of a deity or ideal.
        \item Druids are nature spellcasters who draw power from their veneration of the natural world.
        \item Fighters are highly disciplined warriors who excel in physical combat of any variety.
        \item Wizards are arcane spellcasters who wield the mystic forces of magic to create almost any effect.
        \item Monks are agile masters of ``\ki'' who hone their personal abilities to strike down foes and perform supernatural feats.
        \item Paladins are divinely empowered warriors whose devotion to an alignment grants them the ability to discern and smite their foes.
        \item Rangers are skilled hunters who bridge the divide between nature and civilization.
        \item Rogues are exceptionally skillful characters known for their ability to strike at their foe's weak points in combat.
        \item Spellwarped wield a unique blend of martial skill and narrowly focused magical abilities.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Class Description Format}
        Each class is described from the perspective of a member of that class, using ``you'' in the description.

        \parhead{Class Table}
        The class's table describes the special abilities they get at each level.

        \parhead{Alignment}
        Some classes require specific alignments (see \pcref{Alignment}).
        Most classes allow characters of any alignment.

        \parhead{Class Skills}
        These are skills that members of this class are typically good at (see \pcref{Skills}).

        \subsubsection{Base Class Abilities}
            Abilities contained within this heading only apply to characters with the current class as a \glossterm{base class}.

            \parhead{Skill Points}
            This is the number of skill points that members of this class get.

            \parhead{Defenses}
            Each class grants bonuses to specific defenses.
            These bonuses do not stack with other defense bonuses granted by base classes.
            If a character has multiple base classes, use the highest bonuses that apply to each defense.

            \parhead{Weapon and Armor Proficiencies}
            These are the types of equipment that members of this class are trained in using.

        \subsubsection{Class Abilities}

        \subsubsection{Spellcasting}

            \cf{Clr}{Divine Spells} 
            Your deity grants you the ability to cast divine spells.
            You learn two divine spells from the divine \glossterm{spell list} (see \pcref{Divine Spells}).
            Your \glossterm{spellpower} with divine spells is equal to your \glossterm{divine power}.

            To cast a spell, you must normally spend an \glossterm{action point}.
            Every spell can also be cast as a cantrip.
            Cantrips are weaker, but do not require action points to cast.

            You can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to your own or your deity's.
            Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the \glossterm{Chaos}, \glossterm{Good}, \glossterm{Evil}, and \glossterm{Law} tags in their spell descriptions.

            \cf{Clr}{Rituals} 
            You can perform divine rituals to create unique magical effects (see \pcref{Rituals}).
            You have a ritual book containing two divine rituals of your choice (see \pcref{Divine Rituals}).

            \cf{Clr}[6]{Standard Augment}
            Choose one of the \glossterm{standard augments} (see \pcref{Standard Augments}).
            You can apply that augment to divine spells you cast.
            At 10th level, and every four levels thereafter, you learn an additional standard augment.

            \cf{Clr}[8]{Spell Knowledge}
            You learn an additional divine spell (see \pcref{Divine Spells}).

            \cf{Clr}[16]{Spell Point} 
            You gain a spell point.
            A spell point can be spent to cast spells in place of an action point.
            You recover all spent spell points after a \glossterm{short rest}.

        \subsubsection{Domain Influence}
            All \textit{domain influence} abilities are \glossterm{Magical}.

            \cf{Clr}{Domains}
            You choose two domains which represent your personal spiritual inclinations.
            You must choose your domains from among those your deity offers.
            The domains are listed below.

            \begin{itemize}
                \item{Air}
                \item{Chaos}
                \item{Death}
                \item{Destruction}
                \item{Earth}
                \item{Evil}
                \item{Fire}
                \item{Good}
                \item{Knowledge}
                \item{Law}
                \item{Life}
                \item{Magic}
                \item{Protection}
                \item{Strength}
                \item{Travel}
                \item{Trickery}
                \item{War}
                \item{Water}
                \item{Wild}
            \end{itemize}

            \cf{Clr}{Domain Gift}

            \end{ability}
            \parhead{Mastery} Whenever you move, you can teleport the same distance instead.

                    The belief may be a lie that you told it, or even a simple misunderstanding (such as believing a hidden creature is not present in a room).
                    If the creature does not already hold the chosen belief, this ability automatically fails.
                \end{spelltargetinginfo}

                    \begin{spellattack}{Divine power vs. Mental}

                        It will interpret any evidence that the falsehood is incorrect to be somehow wrong -- an illusion, a conspiracy to decieve it, or any other reason it can think of to continue believing the falsehood.
                        At the end of the effect, the creature can decide whether it believes the falsehood or not, as normal.
                    \end{spellattack}

            \end{ability}
            \parhead{Mastery} You are undetectable by Divination spells and effects.
            They cannot detect your presence, sounds you make, or any actions you take.

        \subsubsection{War}
            \parhead{Gift} You gain proficiency with heavy armor, tower shields, and an additional weapon group of your choice.
            \parhead{Aspect} You gain a \plus1d bonus to damage with \glossterm{strikes}.
            \parhead{Essence} Whenever you cast a spell, you can use this ability as an \glossterm{immediate action} by spending an \glossterm{action point}.
            If you do, the spell gains one of the following effects:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Legion: If the spell would normally affect five or more specific targets, its range is doubled and it instead affects five times that many targets.
                \item Selective: If the spell has an area, it has no effect on your allies in the area.
                \item Widened: If the spell has an area, the size of the area is doubled.
            \end{itemize}
            \parhead{Mastery} You and all allies within a \arealarge radius emanation of you gain a \plus1d bonus to damage with \glossterm{strikes}.

        \subsubsection{Water}
            \parhead{Gift} You add Swim to your cleric class skill list and gain a \plus5 bonus to Swim checks.
            \parhead{Aspect} You can breathe water as easily as a human breathes air, preventing you from drowning or suffocating underwater.
            You also gain a \glossterm{swim speed} equal to your land speed.
            \parhead{Essence} As a standard action, you can spend an \glossterm{action point} to use this ability.
            \begin{ability}
                \begin{spelltargetinginfo}
                    \spellrng{\rnglong}
                \end{spelltargetinginfo}
                \begin{spelleffects}
                    \spelleffect You can speak with and command water within range.
                    You can ask the water simple questions and understand its responses.
                    If you command the water to perform a task, it will do so do the best of its ability until this effect ends.
                    You cannot compel the water to move faster than 30 feet per round.
                    \spelldur Sustain (swift)
                    \spellspecial After you use this ability on a particular area of water, you cannot use it again on that same area for 24 hours.
                \end{spelleffects}
            \end{ability}
            \parhead{Mastery}
            Whenever you move, you can transform yourself into a rushing flow of water with a volume roughly equal to your normal volume until your movement is complete
            In this form, you may move wherever water could go, you cannot take other actions, such as jumping, attacking, or casting spells.
            You may move through squares occupied by creatures or threatened by blocking enemies without penalty.
            \par Your speed is halved when moving uphill and doubled when moving downhill.
            Unusually steep inclines may cause greater movement differences while in this form.
            \par If the water is split, you may reform from anywhere the water has reached, to as little as a single ounce of water.
            If not even an ounce of water exists contiguously, your body reforms from all of the largest available sections of water, cut into pieces of appropriate size.
            This usually causes you to die.

        \subsubsection{Wild}
            \parhead{Gift} You add Creature Handling, Knowledge (nature), and Survival to your cleric class skill list.
            In addition, you gain two skill points which must be spent on any combination of those skills.
            % Does this even make sense?
            \parhead{Aspect} When you gain this ability, you choose one wild aspect ability, as if you were a druid of a level equal to your cleric level (see Wild Aspect, \pref{Drd:Wild Aspect}).
            As a standard action, you can spend an \glossterm{action point} to embody that wild aspect for 1 hour.

        \subsubsection{Ex-Clerics}
            If you grossly violate the code of conduct required by your deity, you lose all spells and magical cleric class abilities.
            You cannot regain those abilities until you atone (see the \spell{atonement} ritual).

    \subsection{Base Class Abilities}
        If you choose druid as a base class, you gain the following abilities.

        \classbasics{Skill Points} 6.

        \classbasics{Defenses} \plus3 Fortitude, \plus2 Mental, \plus1 Reflex.

        \classbasics{Action Points} \plus3.

        \cf{Drd}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
        Druids are proficient with simple weapons, any one other weapon group, scimitars, sickles, and slings.
        In addition, druids are proficient with light armor, medium armor, and shields.
        However, a druid cannot use metal armor; see the Metal Abhorrence ability, below.

    \subsection{Class Abilities}
        If you are a druid, you have the following abilities.

        \cf{Drd}{Druidic Language}
        You know Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, in addition to your normal languages.
        Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.
        Druidic has its own alphabet.

        \cf{Drd}{Metal Abhorrence}
        The oaths that you swear as part of your druidic initiation prohibit you from wearing armor made of metal.
        If you wear prohibited armor or carry a prohibited shield, you are unable to cast druid spells or use any of your \glossterm{magical} druid abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.
        
        You can avoid this penalty by using armor made of wood altered with the \spell{ironwood} ritual.
        Such wood is as strong as steel.

        \cf{Drd}{Nature Power}
        The \glossterm{power} of many druid spells and abilities is determined by your \textit{nature power}.
        Your \textit{nature power} is equal to your level or your Perception, whichever is higher.

        \subsubsection{Spellcasting}

            \cf{Drd}{Nature Spells} 
            Your worship of nature grants you the ability to cast nature spells.
            You learn two nature spells from the nature \glossterm{spell list} (see \pcref{Nature Spells}).
            Your \glossterm{spellpower} with nature spells is equal to your \glossterm{nature power}.

            To cast a spell, you must normally spend an \glossterm{action point}.
            Every spell can also be cast as a cantrip.
            Cantrips are weaker, but do not require action points to cast.

            You can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to your own or your deity's.
            Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the \glossterm{Chaos}, \glossterm{Good}, \glossterm{Evil}, and \glossterm{Law} tags in their spell descriptions.

            \cf{Drd}{Rituals} 
            You can perform nature rituals to create unique magical effects (see \pcref{Rituals}).
            You have a ritual book containing two nature rituals of your choice (see \pcref{Nature Rituals}).

            \cf{Drd}[6]{Standard Augment}
            Choose one of the \glossterm{standard augments} (see \pcref{Standard Augments}).
            You can apply that augment to nature spells you cast.
            At 10th level, and every four levels thereafter, you learn an additional standard augment.

            \cf{Drd}[8]{Spell Knowledge}
            You learn an additional nature spell (see \pcref{Nature Spells}).

            \cf{Drd}[16]{Spell Point} 
            You gain a spell point.
            A spell point can be spent to cast spells in place of an action point.
            You recover all spent spell points after a \glossterm{short rest}.

        \subsubsection{Natural Influence}

            \cf{Drd}{Wild Speech}[Magical] As a standard action, you can spend an \glossterm{action point} to use this ability.
            \begin{ability}
                \begin{spelltargetinginfo}
                    \spellquicktargeting{One animal}{\rngmed}

                \begin{spelleffects}
                    \spelleffect You can speak to and understand the speech of the target animal, and any other animals of the same species.
                    This ability doesn't make the target any more friendly or cooperative than normal.
                    Wary and cunning animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while stupid ones tend to make inane comments and are unlikely to say or understand anything of use.
                    \spelldur Sustain (swift)
                \end{spelleffects}
            \end{ability}

            \cf{Drd}[2]{Natural Lore}
            You gain two extra skill points which must be spent on the Creature Handling, Heal, Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (nature), Ride, or Survival skills.

            \cf{Drd}[3]{Wild Aspect}[Magical]
            You gain the ability to embody an aspect of an animal or of nature itself.
            Choose a single wild aspect from the list below.
            Many wild aspects have a minimum level prerequisite, as indicated in the title of the ability.
            That ability is normally active.
            You may suppress or resume the effects of any number of \textit{wild aspects} you have as a \glossterm{swift action}.

            The abilities in the list below describe the effects of the aspect.
            Your appearance also changes to match the aspect's effects, but the nature of this change is not described.
            Different druids change in different ways.
            For example, one druid might gain unusually large eyes when embodying the low-light vision aspect, while another might change their irises into slits, like a cat, when embodying the same aspect.
            You choose how your appearance changes when you gain a wild aspect.
            This change cannot be used to gain an additional substantive benefit beyond the effects given in the description of the aspect.

            Many wild aspects grant natural weapons.
            See \pcref{Natural Weapons}, for details about natural weapons.
            At 7th level, and every four levels thereafter, you gain an additional wild aspect.

            \subcf{Animal Affinity}
            You gain a \plus2 bonus to Creature Handling and Ride checks.
            \subcf{Armaments of the Bear}
            Your mouth and hands transform, allowing you to perform bite and claw attacks.
            The bite attack deals 1d8 damage for a Medium creature, and the claws deal 1d6 damage.
            \subcf{Gore}
            Your head transforms, allowing you to perform a gore attack.
            The attack deals 1d8 damage for a Medium druid.
            In addition, you gain a \plus2 bonus to accuracy with shove attacks (see \pcref{Shove}).
            \subcf{Monkey Climb}
            You gain a \glossterm{climb speed} equal to your land speed.
            \subcf{Senses}
            You gain low-light vision.
            You treat sources of light as if they had double their normal illumination range.
            If you already have low-light vision, you double its benefit, allowing you to treat sources of light as if they had four times their normal illumination range.
            In addition, you gain \glossterm{darkvision} out to 50 feet, allowing you to see in complete darkness.
            If you already have darkvision, you increase its range by 50 feet.
            \subcf{Woodland Stride}
            You may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at your normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.
            The plants bend of their own volition to allow the druid to pass.
            However, plants magically manipulated to impede motion still affect your.

            \subcf{7th -- A Thousand Faces}
            You may use your spellpower in place of your Disguise skill when making Disguise checks to alter your own appearance.
            \subcf{7th -- Constrict}
            Your body transforms, improving your grappling abilities.
            You gain a \plus2 bonus to accuracy with grapple attacks (see \pcref{Grapple}).
            In addition, you gain a constrict attack.
            This attack deals 1d10 damage for a Medium druid, but it can only be used against a foe you aregrappling with.
            \subcf{7th -- Hawk}
            You grow wings, granting your a glide speed equal to your land speed.
            See \pcref{Gliding}, for more details.
            In addition, your feet transform, allowing you to perform a talon attack.
            The attack deals 1d6 damage for a Medium creature.
            \subcf{7th -- Lope}
            You gain the ability to move on all four limbs.
            When doing so, you gain a \plus30 foot bonus to your land speed, up to a maximum of double your original speed.
            When not using your hands to move, your ability to use your hands is unchanged.
            Descending to four legs and rising up to stand on two legs again does not take an action.
            \subcf{7th -- Scent}
            You gain the \glossterm{scent} ability.
            \subcf{7th -- Shrink}
            You shrink by one size category (see \pcref{Size in Combat}).
            This is a \glossterm{Sizing} effect.
            \subcf{7th -- Slither}
            You gain a \glossterm{climb speed} equal to your land speed.
            You do not need to use your hands to climb in this way.
            In addition, you gain a bite attack that deals 1d8 damage for a Medium druid.
            % \subcf{7th -- Spikes}
            % Whenever a creature adjacent to the druid makes a physical attack against you, the attacking creature takes 1d4 piercing damage \plus1d per two nature power.
            % A creature can only be dealt damage by this effect once per round.

            % Is this how poison actually works?

            % \subcf{11th -- Elemental Retribution}
            % Whenever a creature within \rngmed range of you attacks you, the attacking creature takes 1d6 damage per two nature power of either cold, electricity, or fire damage.
            % You may choose the damage type independently for each attacking creature.
            % A creature can only be dealt damage by this effect once per round.
            \subcf{11th -- Beetle's Carapace} You gain a \plus1 bonus to Armor defense.
            \subcf{11th -- Fluid Motion} You are immune to effects that restrict your mobility, and you suffer no penalties for acting underwater.
            In addition, you gain a \plus10 bonus to Reflex defense against grapple attacks, as well as on grapple attacks or Escape Artist checks made to escape a grapple or a pin.
            \subcf{11th -- Grow}
            You increase in size by one size category (see \pcref{Size in Combat}).
            This is a \glossterm{Sizing} effect.
            \subcf{11th -- Natural Grab}
            If you hit with a natural attack, you may attempt to grapple your foe as an immediate action.
            \subcf{11th -- Natural Trip}
            If you hit with a natural attack, you may attempt to trip your foe as an immediate action.

            Overwhelmed foes you threaten increase their \glossterm{overwhelm penalties} by 1.
            \subcf{11th -- Venom}
            If you hit with a natural attack, you may inject poison into your foe as an immediate action.
            This is a \glossterm{condition}, and lasts until removed.
            At the end of each round, you make a \textit{nature power} vs. Fortitude attack against all creatures you have poisoned.
            The effects of the poison are described below.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item First success: the target is \sickened until the effect ends.

                \item Third success: the target is \nauseated until the effect ends.
                \item Third failure: the target is no longer poisoned, and any lingering effects from the poison end.
            \end{itemize}
            % TODO poison stacking rules
            \par In addition, you gains a bite attack that deals 1d8 damage for a Medium druid.

            \subcf{15th -- Earth Glide}
            You gain the earth glide ability, as an earth elemental.
            This allows you to glide through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth as if it were air.
            You can walk or climb at any angle in the earth.
            However, you cannot breathe, speak, or hear while gliding in this way.
            While gliding, you can remain partially within the earth, granting you cover.
            \subcf{15th -- Natural Renewal}
            At the end of each round, you heal hit points equal to your \textit{nature power}.
            \subcf{15th -- Wings}
            You grow wings, granting you a \glossterm{fly speed} equal to your land speed.
            While \unencumbered, you can fly (see \pcref{Flying}).
            % TODO: standard flight limitation

            \subcf{19th -- Solar Radiance}
            The druid continuously radiates bright light out to a 500 foot radius (and shadowy illumination for an additional 500 feet).
            The illumination is so bright that you become hard to look at.
            Any creature attacking your from within the radius of bright light becomes \partiallyblinded for 2 rounds after the attack.

            \cf{Drd}[5]{Natural Vigor}
            At the end of each round, you heal hit points equal to half your \textit{nature power}.

            \cf{Drd}[9]{Natural Lore}
            You gain two extra skill points which must be spent on the Creature Handling, Heal, Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (nature), Ride, or Survival skills.

            \cf{Drd}[13]{Greater Natural Vigor}
            Your healing from the \textit{natural vigor} ability increases to be equal to your \textit{nature power}.

            \cf{Drd}[17]{Nature's Champion}
            You gain a \plus2 bonus to the Creature Handling, Heal, Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (nature), Ride, and Survival skills.

            \cf{Drd}[20]{Avatar of Nature}[Magical]
            If you die, except if by old age, you may choose to have your body and soul become an instrument of nature's will.
            Your body immediately decomposes or otherwise disappears, and your soul does not travel to an afterlife.
            You has no physical form, and cannot use any of your normal abilities.
            Instead, you have a fly speed of 100 feet, with special maneuverability.
            As a standard action, you can temporarily possess any living plants or animals within a 10 mile radius of the place of your death.

            While possessing a living plant or animal, you can see through its senses and control its actions completely.
            In addition, you may cast spells, and the spells take effect as if the plant or animal had cast them.
            You use the plant or animal's position to determine range, visible targets, and so on.
            You do not require verbal or somatic components to cast your spells in this form, but are unable to cast spells or perform rituals that require material components or focus objects.

            While not possessing a plant or animal, you can rest, or you can focus on reincarnating your physical form.
            Creating a new body in this way takes 12 consecutive hours of concentration.
            At the end of that time, you are reincarnated in a new body in your location, as the effect of the \spell{reincarnate} ritual, except that you can choose your race from among the races listed (not including the ``Other'' race).

            While you are an avatar of nature, you do not age and you cannot die of old age.
            You can continue to exist in this form indefinitely.

        \subsubsection{Nature Spell Mastery}
            You must have the ability to cast nature spells to gain these abilities.

            \cf{Drd}[2]{Spell Point}
            You gain a spell point.
            A spell point can be spent to cast spells in place of an action point.
            You recover all spent spell points after a \glossterm{short rest}.

            \cf{Drd}[3]{Spell Knowledge} 
            You learn an additional nature spell (see \pcref{Nature Spells}).

            \cf{Drd}[4]{Custom Augments}
            Choose a \glossterm{custom augment} for a nature spell you know.
            You can apply that augment to that spell (see \pcref{Augments}).
            At 6th level, and every two levels thereafter, you learn an additional custom augment for a nature spell you know.

    % \subcf{15th -- Air Mantle}
    % You are surrounded by a mantle of air.
    % Thrown and projectile weapons have a 50\% chance to miss your while this effect is active.
    % Unusually large weapons, such as a giant's boulders, may suffer a decreased miss chance as appropriate to their size.
    % \subcf{15th -- Aqueous Step}
    % Wherever the druid moves, you leave a path of animated water that can grab creatures.
    % Whenever a creature crosses the path, the druid makes a Reflex attack to trip the creature, causing it to fall prone and waste the rest of its movement.
    % Your accuracy is equal to your druid level \add your Constitution.
    % \subcf{15th -- Flaming Step}
    % Wherever the druid moves, you leave a path of burning flame behind your that lasts for 1 round.
    % Whenever a creature crosses the path, the druid makes a Reflex attack to deal damage to the creature.
    % The attack deals 1d8 points of fire damage per two druid levels.
    % Your accuracy is equal to your druid level \add your Constitution.
    % A failed attack deals half damage.
    % \subcf{15th -- Lifegiving Step}
    % Wherever the druid moves, you leave a path of small, living plants that entangle foes for 1 round.
    % Whenever a creature crosses the path, the druid makes a Reflex attack to entangle the creature, causing it to waste the rest of its movement.
    % Your accuracy is equal to your druid level \add your Constitution.
    % The plants appear on any surface, and will continue to grow if they can survive, though they may die quickly if they appear on inhospitable terrain.
    % \subcf{17th -- Flaming Soul}
    % You gain the fire subtype, making your immune to fire but giving your a 50\% vulnerability to cold damage.
    % In addition, whenever you deal fire damage to a creature, the creature is \ignited for 5 rounds.
    % \subcf{17th -- Sunblessed Rejuvenation}
    % You gain fast healing equal to your druid level as long as you remain in sunlight or touches a plant of your size or larger.
    % \subcf{17th -- Sunscour}
    % This aspect functions like the heart of the sun natural aspect, except that it also suppresses shadow effects and the visual components of illusions within the area of bright light.

    % \subcf{17th -- Water's Flow}
    % As a swift action, the druid can transform herself into a rushing flow of water with a volume roughly equal to your normal volume until the end of your turn.
    % In this form, she may move wherever water could go, but she cannot take other actions, such as jumping, attacking, or casting spells.
    % Your speed is halved when moving uphill and doubled when moving downhill.
    % She may move through squares occupied by creatures or threatened by blocking enemies without penalty.
    % She may return to your normal form as a free action.
    % \par If the water is split, she may reform from anywhere the water has reached, to as little as a single ounce of water.
    % If not even an ounce of water exists contiguously, your body reforms from the largest available parts of water, cut into pieces of appropriate size.
    % This usually causes the druid to die.

    \subsection{Ex-Druids}
        A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and magical druid class abilities.
        She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until you atone (see the \spell{atonement} ritual).

    % \subsection{Variant Druids}

    %     \subsubsection{Blighter}

    %         Blighters draw power from nature, as do other druids. However, while other druids revere nature and draw power from it gently, blighters steal power from nature forcefully. Wherever a blighter goes, destruction and death surely follows.

    %         \altcf{Blight} Instead of meditating to regain spell slots, a blighter draws power from your environment forcefully.
    %         This affects a \areahuge radius zone centered on your, and the process takes 1 minute of concentration.
    %         At the end of every round, every living thing in the area other than the blighter takes damage equal to your nature power.
    %         All inanimate plants of Huge size or smaller immediately wither and die.
    %         The earth becomes cracked and infertile, and any nutrients from the soil are destroyed.
    %         This ability has no effect on artificial environments or materials, such as metal or worked stone.
    %         At the end of the minute, the blighter regains your spent nature spell slots.

    %         A blighter can only blight your surroundings in this way once per hour.
    %         If your surroundings are already blighted or are not natural terrain, she cannot use this ability to regain your spells.
    %         Instead, she must meditate for 8 hours to slowly draw power from your surroundings, as a normal druid.

    %         \altcf{Spells} As normal, except that a blighter adds all Vivimancy arcane spells to your spell list.

    %         \altcf[2]{Wild Speech} As normal, except that a blighter gains a \plus5 bonus to Intimidate against your wild speech targets, and a \minus5 penalty to Persuasion.

    %         \altcf[10]{Blightcasting}

    %         \altcf[20]{Improved Blightcasting}

        % \subsubsection{Rotbringer}

        %     While most druids seek to emulate and interact with animals, rotbringers focus on the power of fungi, decay, and regeneration.

        %     \altcf{Invoke Rot} Instead of meditating to regain spell slots, a rotbringer accelerates the natural forces of decomposition and decay on your environment.
        %     This affects a \areahuge radius zone centered on your, and the process takes 1 minute of concentration.
        %     All organic objects of Huge size or smaller, such as plants and corpses, decompose.
        %     This decomposition kills inanimate, living plants.
        %     All organic objects, regardless of size, are covered with various fungi.
        %     This ability has no effect on artificial environments or materials, such as metal or worked stone.
        %     At the end of the minute, the rotbringer regains your spent nature spell slots.

        %     If the rotbringer decomposes a Huge object with this ability, or a combination of smaller objects equivalent in size to a Huge object, you gain an bonus nature spell slot of your highest available spell level.
        %     This extra spell slot lasts until it is used, or until you regain your spell slots again.

        %     A rotbringer can only invoke rot on your surroundings in this way once per hour.
        %     If your surroundings are already decomposed or are not natural terrain, she cannot use this ability to regain your spells.
        %     Instead, she must meditate for 8 hours to slowly draw power from your surroundings, as a normal druid.

        %     \altcf[2]{Wild Speech} The rotbringer gains the ability to speak with plants at 2nd level.
        %     You gain the ability to speak with animals at 6th level, instead of at 2nd level.

        %     \altcf[3rd]{Wild Aspect} The rotbringer does not gain this ability.

        %     \altcf[3rd]{Rot Spell} The druid learns an additional spell slot and spell known.
        %     The spell must be taken from the following list of spells.
        %     The spell's level cannot exceed half your druid level.
        %     If she already knows a spell from the list at every spell level you ha access to, she may instead learn any nature spell (see \pcref{Nature Spells}).

        %     At 5th level, and every odd level, the druid may learn a new spell.

            \cf{Ftr}[20]{Legendary Discipline}

    \subparhead{Other} Bluff, Intimidate, Persuasion.

    \subsection{Base Class Abilities}
        If you choose mage as a base class, you gain the following abilities.

        \classbasics{Skill Points} 4.

        \classbasics{Defenses} \plus3 Mental, \plus2 Reflex, \plus1 Fortitude.

        \classbasics{Action Points} \plus3.

        \cf{Mge}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
        Mages are proficient with simple weapons and one other weapon group.
        They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield.
        Armor of any type interferes with a mage's arcane gestures, which can cause your spells with somatic components to fail.

    \subsection{Class Abilities}
        If you are a mage, you have the following abilities.

        \cf{Mge}{Arcane Essence}
        All mages have access to great arcane power.
        However, not all mages acquired this power in the same way.
        You choose an arcane essence.
        Many mage abilities have special effects based on whether you are a sorcerer or a mage.
        \parhead{Sorcerer} Sorcerers have an intuitive connection to magic that allows them to cast spells without preparation or training.
        \parhead{Wizard} Wizards studied arcane mysteries for years to learn the secret ways of magic.
        A wizard casts spells with your Intelligence.

        \subsubsection{Spellcasting}

            \cf{Mge}{Arcane Spells} 
            You can cast arcane spells.
            You learn two arcane spells from the arcane \glossterm{spell list} (see \pcref{Arcane Spells}).
            \subparhead{Sorcerer} Your spellpower with arcane spells is equal to your character level or your Willpower, whichever is higher.
            The maximum spell level you can cast is equal to half your mage level (minimum 1).
            \subparhead{Wizard} Your spellpower with arcane spells is equal to your character level or your Intelligence, whichever is higher.
            The maximum spell level you can cast is equal to half your mage level (minimum 1) or your Intelligence, whichever is lower.

            To cast a spell, you must normally spend an \glossterm{action point}.
            Every spell can also be cast as a cantrip.
            Cantrips are weaker, but do not require action points to cast.

            \cf{Mge}{Rituals}
            \subparhead{Sorcerer} You cannot perform arcane rituals.
            \subparhead{Wizard} You can perform arcane rituals to create unique magical effects (see \pcref{Rituals}).
            You have a ritual book containing two arcane rituals of your choice (see \pcref{Arcane Rituals}).

            \cf{Mge}[6]{Standard Augment}
            Choose one of the \glossterm{standard augments} (see \pcref{Standard Augments}).
            You can apply that augment to arcane spells you cast.
            At 10th level, and every four levels thereafter, you learn an additional standard augment.

            \cf{Mge}[16]{Spell Point}
            You gain a spell point.
            A spell point can be spent to cast spells in place of an action point.
            You recover all spent spell points after a \glossterm{short rest}.

        \subsubsection{Arcane Lore}
            You must have the ability to cast arcane spells to gain these abilities.

            \cf{Mge}[2]{Spell Knowledge} 
            You learn an additional spell from the arcane \glossterm{spell list} (see \pcref{Arcane Spells}).

            \cf{Mge}[3]{Arcane Insight} 
            You gain a greater understanding of magic.
            You choose one of the following insights.
            Each insight can be chosen multiple times.
            At 7th level, and every four levels thereafter, you gain an additional arcane insight.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Innate Spell: Choose a spell you know.
                    You no longer need verbal or somatic components to cast that spell.
                    \par If you choose this insight multiple times, she must choose a different spell each time.
                \item Personal Spell: Choose a spell you know.
                    You cannot miscast that spell (see \pcref{Miscasting}).
                    If you would miscast it, the spell simply fails without effect.
                    In addition, you automatically succeeds at all Concentration checks you make to cast the spell.
                    \par If you choose this insight multiple times, you must choose a different spell each time.
                \item Specialization: Choose a school of magic.
                    You learn an additional spell from that school of magic.
                    In exchange, you must ban two other schools of magic.
                    You can never learn or cast spells or rituals from your banned schools.
                    If you know spells from a banned school, you must immediately learn different spells from unbanned schools in their place.
                    \par If you choose this insight multiple times, you must choose to specialize in the same school each time.
            \end{itemize}

            \subparhead{Sorcerer} You may also choose the Expanded Spell Knowledge insight.
            You choose a single spell from the divine spell list or nature spell list and add it to your arcane spell list.
            This does not grant you the spell as a spell known, but you may exchange one of your spells known to learn that new spell.
            \par If you choose this insight multiple times, you must choose a different spell each time.

            \subparhead{Wizard} You may also choose the Ritual Spell insight.
            You scribe an arcane spell you know into your ritual book.
            The spell is treated as a ritual, and you can perform a one minute ritual to gain the spell's effect.
            Performing the ritual costs the normal amount of material components for a ritual of its level (see \pcref{Ritual Costs}).
            You can apply standard augments or custom augments to the spell normally, increasing the ritual's level and material component cost appropriately.

            \cf{Mge}[5]{Lesser Essence Lore}[Magical]
            You gain an ability based on your choice of arcane essence.
            \subparhead{Sorcerer} You gain bonus hit points equal to your spellpower with arcane spells.
            \subparhead{Wizard} You gains a \plus2 bonus to all Knowledge skills.

            \cf{Mge}[9]{Spell Knowledge}
            You learn an additional spell from the arcane \glossterm{spell list} (see \pcref{Arcane Spells}).

            \cf{Mge}[13]{Essence Lore}[Magical]
            You gain an ability based on your choice of arcane essence.
            \subparhead{Sorcerer} You gain \glossterm{magic resistance} equal to 5 \add your spellpower with arcane spells.
            \subparhead{Wizard} You learn the Contingency augment, allowing you to prepare a spell so it takes effect automatically if specific circumstances arise.
            The Contingency augment adds two levels to a spell's level.
            You can apply this augment to any arcane spell with a casting time of a single standard action.

            Casting a spell with the Contingency augment takes 5 minutes.
            When the casting is complete, the spell has no immediate effect.
            Instead, it automatically takes effect when some specific circumstances arise.
            During this casting time, you specify what circumstances cause the spell to take effect.

            The spell can be set to trigger in response to any circumstances that a typical human observing you and your situation could detect.
            For example, you could specify ``when I fall at least 50 feet'' or ``when I become bloodied'', but not ``when there is an invisible creature within 50 feet of me'' or ``when I am at 17 hit points or fewer.''
            The more specific the required circumstances, the better -- vague requirements, such as ``when I am in danger'', may cause the spell to trigger unexpectedly or fail to trigger at all.
            If you attempt to specify multiple separate triggering conditions, such as ``when I take damage or when an enemy is adjacent to me'', the spell will randomly ignore all but one of the conditions.

            If the spell needs to be targeted, the trigger condition can specify a simple rule for identifying how to target the spell, such as ``the closest enemy''.
            If the rule is poorly worded or imprecise, the spell may target incorrectly or fail to activate at all.
            Any spells which require decisions, such as the \spell{dimension door} spell, must have those decisions made at the time it is cast.
            You cannot alter those decisions when the contingency takes effect.

            You can have only one spell with this augment active at a time.
            If you use the augment again with a different spell, the new spell.

            \cf{Mge}[17]{Greater Essence Lore}[Magical]
            You gain an ability based on your choice of arcane essence.

            \subparhead{Sorcerer} Whenever you resist a spell with your \glossterm{magic resistance}, you gain the ability to cast that spell once.
            The spell retains all augments, effects from feats and other abilities, and similar modifications from the original caster, and you cannot choose any other augments or apply effects from your own abilities.
            However, you make all other decisions required to cast the spell, and uses your spellpower to determine the spell's effects.
            Once you cast the spell, you expend the absorbed energy, and you cannot cast it again.

            If you resist multiple spells simultaneously, or if you resist another spell with your magic resistance before casting the previous spell you resisted, you choose which spell you gain the ability to cast.

            \subparhead{Wizard} You may have two spells active with the Contingency augment, rather than only one.
            Whenever you cast a new spell with the Contingency augment, you choose which existing contingency to replace.

            Only one contingency can trigger in a given round.
            If both would trigger simultaneously, only the first spell cast triggers.
            The second spell cast does not trigger that round.

            \cf{Mge}[20]{Archmage}
            You no longer need to spend action points to cast spells.
            If you have any spell points, you lose those spell points and gain the same number of legend points instead.

        \subsubsection{Arcane Spell Mastery}
            You must have the ability to cast arcane spells to gain these abilities.

            \cf{Mge}[2]{Spell Point}
            You gain a spell point.
            A spell point can be spent to cast spells in place of an action point.
            You recover all spent spell points after a \glossterm{short rest}.

            \cf{Mge}[3]{Spell Knowledge} 
            You learn an additional spell from the arcane \glossterm{spell list} (see \pcref{Arcane Spells}).

            \cf{Mge}[4]{Custom Augments}
            Choose a \glossterm{custom augment} for a arcane spell you know.
            You can apply that augment to that spell (see \pcref{Augments}).
            At 6th level, and every two levels thereafter, you learn an additional custom augment for a arcane spell you know.

        \classbasics{Action Points} \plus3.

        \cf{Mnk}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
        Monks are proficient with simple weapons, monk weapons, and any one other weapon group.
        Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields.
        When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses the benefit of your enlightened defense, fast movement, and \ki abilities.

    \subsection{Class Abilities}
        If you are a monk, you have the following abilities.

        \subsubsection{Ki}
            \cf{Mnk}{Ki Power}
            The \glossterm{power} of your ki abilities is determined by your \textit{ki power}.
            Your \textit{ki power} is equal to your level or your Willpower, whichever is higher.

            \cf{Mnk}{Manifest Ki} 
            You gain the ability to channel your ki to temporarily enhance your abilities.
            Choose a single ki manifestation from the list below.
            Many ki manifestations have a minimum level prerequisite, as indicated in the title of the ability.
            At the start of each round, you can spend an \glossterm{action point} to use a ki manifestation.
            This does not take an action, but you can only use one ki manifestation per round.

            At 4th level, and every three levels thereafter, you gain an additional ki manifestation.

            \subcf{Elegant Whirl of Fluid Motion}
            You gain a \plus10 bonus to Acrobatics checks until the end of the round.
            \subcf{Leap of the Heavens}
            You gain a \plus10 bonus to Jump checks until the end of the round.
            \subcf{Scale the Highest Tower}
            You gain a \plus10 bonus to Climb checks until the end of the round.

            \subcf{4th -- Dance of Falling Feathers}
            If you are in free-fall, your fall is dramatically slowed.
            You fall only 60 feet this round, and take no falling damage if you hit the ground.
            \subcf{4th -- Fists of Distant Force}
            You empower your unarmed attacks with \ki, allowing you to strike distant foes.
            Until the end of the round, you gain an additional ten feet of \glossterm{reach} with your unarmed attacks, extending your \textit{threatened area}.

            \subcf{7th -- Burst of Blinding Speed}
            You gain a \plus30 foot bonus to your land speed, up to a maximum of double your original speed, until the end of the round.
            In addition, you cannot be followed until the end of the round (see \pcref{Follow}).
            \subcf{7th -- See the Flow of Life}
            You gain the ability to see the \ki of living creatures until the end of the round.
            You can ``see'' any living creatures and their equipment within 50 feet perfectly, regardless of lighting conditions, invisibility, or any other means of concealment.
            This cannot detect living creatures through solid walls, however.
            \subcf{7th -- Surpass the Mortal Limits}
            Until the end of the round, you may use your \textit{ki power} in place of your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution when making checks.

            \subcf{11th -- Diamond Fists}
            You gain a \plus2d bonus to damage with your unarmed attacks until the end of the round.
            In addition, you treat your unarmed strike as if it were an adamantine weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and hardness.
            \subcf{11th -- Flash Step}
            Until the end of the round, whenever you move, you teleport directly to your destination instead.
            This does not change the total distance you can move, but you can teleport in any direction, even vertically.
            If your \glossterm{line of effect} to your destination is blocked, or if this would somehow place you inside a solid object, your movement is cancelled and you remain where you are.
            You can teleport in multiple steps within the same movement to get around obstacles you see.

            \subcf{14th -- Awaken the Pacifist Heart}
            As an immediate action, when you hit with a melee strike, she can make a \Ki power vs. Mental attack against the struck creature.
            Success means the target is unable to take violent actions, such as attacking, for 2 rounds.
            If the target takes damage after the current round, the effect is broken.

            \subcf{17th -- Flash Burst}
            This ability functions like this \textit{flash step} ability, except that your movement speed is also increased tenfold.

        \subsubsection{Unfettered Warrior}
            \cf{Mnk}{Unarmed Warrior}
            You are \glossterm{proficient} with your \glossterm{unarmed attack}.
            In addition, you gain a \plus2d bonus to damage with your unarmed attack.

            When \monkunencumbered, you gain a \plus2 bonus to Armor defense.

            \cf{Mnk}[5]{Intuitive Reaction} You can react to danger before your senses would normally allow you to do so.
            You reduce your \glossterm{overwhelm penalties} by 1.

            In addition, you are not \unaware when attacked by surprise.

            \cf{Mnk}[8]{Stunning Fist} As a standard action, you can spend an \glossterm{action point} to use this ability.

                    If you deal damage to the creature, it is \dazed.
                    If you deal damage with a \glossterm{critical hit}, the target is \stunned instead.

            \cf{Mnk}[11]{Greater Intuitive Reaction}
            Your reduction of \glossterm{overwhelm penalties} from the \textit{uncanny dodge} ability increases to 2.

            \cf{Mnk}[14]{Greater Flurry of Blows}
            When you use your \textit{flurry of blows} ability, you may make the \glossterm{strike} with any melee weapon you wield, rather than only your unarmed attack.

            \cf{Mnk}[17]{Greater Unfettered Defense}
            Your bonus to Armor defense from your \textit{unfettered defense} ability improves to \plus3.

            You are immune to being \glossterm{deafened}, \glossterm{fatigued}, and \glossterm{sickened}.

            In addition, you no longer take penalties to your attributes for aging, and cannot be magically aged.

            \cf{Mnk}[15]{Inner Peace}
            The bonus to Mental defense from the \textit{serenity} ability increases to \plus4.

            \cf{Mnk}[18]{Transcend Limits}
            Whenever you spend your last \glossterm{action point}, you regain a spent action point at the end of the next round.

            \cf{Mnk}[20]{Transcend Mortality}[Magical]
            If you die, you may choose to retain control of your body and soul through sheer force of will.
            Your body immediately disappears, and your soul does not travel to an afterlife.
            Instead, your body reforms with no trace of its injuries 24 hours later.
            The reformed body is in perfect health and can be any age you choose, to a minimum of the age of adulthood for your race.
            You can reform your body at the place where you died, or in any place on the same plane that is deeply familiar to you.

            After each time you reform herself this way, it takes 24 additional hours to reform the next time she ``dies''.
            A monk with this ability can only be permanently killed by the direct intervention of a deity.

        \subsubsection{Ex-Monks}
            % TODO: this wording is repetitive
            If you become chaotic, you lose all of your \glossterm{magical} monk abilities.
            If you stop being chaotic, you regain your magical monk abilities.

        Paladins are proficient with simple weapons, any three other weapon groups, all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and shields.

        \cf{Pal}{Divine Protection}[Magical]

        You may add your Willpower to your Armor defense in place of Dexterity or Constitution (see \pcref{Defenses}).

    \subsection{Class Abilities}
        If you are a paladin, you have the following abilities.

        \cf{Pal}{Devoted Alignment} 
        You are devoted to a specific alignment.
        You must choose one of your alignment components: good, evil, lawful, or chaotic.
        The alignment you choose is your devoted alignment.
        Your paladin abilities are affected by this choice.
        % seems unnecessary
        % You excel at slaying creatures with alignments opposed to your devoted alignment.
        Your alignment cannot be changed without extraordinary repurcussions.

        \cf{Pal}{Devotion Power}
        The \glossterm{power} of many paladin spells and abilities is determined by your \textit{devotion power}.
        Your \textit{devotion power} is equal to your level or your Willpower, whichever is higher.

        \subsubsection{Devoted Paragon}

            \cf{Pal}[2]{Spell Point}
            You gain a spell point.
            A spell point can be spent to cast spells in place of an action point.
            You recover all spent spell points after a \glossterm{short rest}.

            \cf{Pal}[4]{Lay on Hands}[Magical] As a standard action, you can spend an \glossterm{action point} to use this ability.

                    \spelleffect The target is healed for 1d8 damage \add 1d per two \textit{devotion power}.
                    In addition, you may remove one \glossterm{condition} from the target.
                \end{spelleffects}
            \end{ability}

            \cf{Pal}[5]{Aligned Aura}[Magical]
            Your devotion to your alignment affects the world around you, bringing it closer to your ideals.
            You constantly radiate an aura in an \areamed radius \glossterm{emanation} from you.
            The effect of the aura depends on your devoted alignment, as described below.
            You can suppress or resume the aura as a \glossterm{swift action}.

            \subparhead{Chaos} Whenever you or an ally in the area rolls a 1 on an attack roll when making a \glossterm{strike}, it explodes (see \pcref{Exploding Attacks}).
            This does not affect additional dice rolled if the attack roll explodes.
            \subparhead{Evil} All other creatures in the area suffer a \minus1 penalty to all defenses.
            \subparhead{Good} Whenever a creature in the area takes damage, you may take half that damage (rounded down) instead.
            Any abilities you have that would make the attack miss or fail have no effect, but your abilities that allow you to reduce or ignore its effects work normally.
            The protected creature takes the remaining half of the damage, and suffers any non-damaging effects of the attack normally.
            \subparhead{Law} Whenever you or an ally in the area rolls a 1 on an attack roll when making a \glossterm{strike}, the roll is treated as a 6.

            \cf{Pal}[8]{Unbending Devotion}[Magical]
            You are immune to \glossterm{Mind} \glossterm{conditions}.

            \cf{Pal}[9]{Expanded Aura}
            The area of your \textit{aligned aura} becomes a \arealarge radius \glossterm{emanation} from you.

            \cf{Pal}[12]{Greater Lay on Hands} 
            You gain a \plus1d bonus to the healing from your \textit{lay on hands} ability.
            In addition, you can remove any number of conditions with that ability, rather than only one.

            \cf{Pal}[13]{Greater Aligned Aura}[Magical]
            The effect of your \textit{aligned aura} becomes stronger based on your devoted alignment.

            \subparhead{Chaos} Whenever an enemy in the area rolls a 10 on an attack roll when making a \glossterm{strike}, it is forced to rereroll the attack roll and take the second result.
            \subparhead{Evil} The penalty imposed by the aura increases to \minus2.
            \subparhead{Good} When you redirect damage from an ally with this aura, you can redirect all effects of the attack to you instead of only half the damage.
            \subparhead{Law} Whenever an enemy in the area rolls a 10 on an attack roll when making a \glossterm{strike}, the roll is treated as a 6.

            \cf{Pal}[17]{Greater Unbending Devotion}
            You are immune to all hostile \glossterm{Mind} effects.

            \cf{Pal}[20]{Aligned Soul}[Magical]
            While you are dead, you may approach the deity or governing figure of your afterlife and request to be returned to life to continue your mission.
            Travelling to the relevant figure and making the request takes 12 hours.
            Unless there are extenuating circumstances, this request is almost always granted, and you are resurrected in a new body at a location of the entity's choice.
            This functions like the \spell{resurrection} ritual, except that no part of the body is required, and a new body is created by the entity.
            You can be resurrected in this way regardless of the condition of your body, but not if your soul has been trapped or otherwise prevented from going to the correct afterlife.

        % TODO: clarify interaction between this ability and cleric spellcasting;
        % you shouldn't have both, but they technically use different spellpowers
        \subsubsection{Spellcasting}

            \cf{Pal}{Divine Spells}
            Your devotion to your alignment grants you the ability to cast divine spells.
            You learn two divine spells from the divine \glossterm{spell list} (see \pcref{Divine Spells}).
            Your \glossterm{spellpower} with divine spells is equal to your \glossterm{devotion power}.

            To cast a spell, you must normally spend an \glossterm{action point}.
            Every spell can also be cast as a cantrip.
            Cantrips are weaker, but do not require action points to cast.

            You can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to your own.
            Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the \glossterm{Chaos}, \glossterm{Good}, \glossterm{Evil}, and \glossterm{Law} tags in their spell descriptions.

            \cf{Pal}[6]{Standard Augment}
            Choose one of the \glossterm{standard augments} (see \pcref{Standard Augments}).
            You can apply that augment to divine spells you cast.
            At 10th level, and every four levels thereafter, you learn an additional standard augment.

            \cf{Pal}[8]{Spell Knowledge}
            You learn an additional divine spell (see \pcref{Divine Spells}).

            \cf{Pal}[16]{Spell Point} 
            You gain a spell point.
            A spell point can be spent to cast spells in place of an action point.
            You recover all spent spell points after a \glossterm{short rest}.

        \subsubsection{Zealous Warrior}
            \cf{Pal}{Smite}[Magical] As a standard action, you can spend an \glossterm{action point} to use this ability.
            \begin{ability}
                \begin{spelleffects}
                    \spelleffect You make a \glossterm{strike}.
                    If your target shares your devoted alignment, the strike deals no damage.
                    Otherwise, the strike gains a \plus1d bonus to damage, and you regain the action point spent to use this ability.
                \end{spelleffects}
            \end{ability}

            \cf{Pal}[3]{Zealous Offense}[Magical]
            If you deal damage to a creature with your \textit{smite} ability, you gain a \plus1d bonus to damage against that creature with all \glossterm{strikes}.
            This effect lasts until you take a \glossterm{short rest}.

            \cf{Pal}[7]{Unfaltering Zeal}
            You gain a \plus1 bonus to Fortitude, Reflex, and Mental defense.

            \cf{Pal}[11]{Pass Judgment}[Magical] As a \glossterm{swift action}, you can spend an \glossterm{action point} to use this ability.
            \begin{ability}

                \begin{spelleffects}
                    \spelleffect For the purpose of all spells and effects, the target is treated as if it had the alignment opposed to your devoted alignment.
                    This only affects its alignment along the alignment axis your devoted alignment is on.
                    For example, if your devoted alignment was evil, a chaotic neutral target would be treated as chaotic good.
                    In addition, the target is treated as if you had smited it for the purpose of the \textit{zealous offense} ability and similar effects.

                    You can use this ability to do battle against foes who share your alignment, but you should exercise caution in doing so.
                    Persecution of allies can lead you to fall and become an ex-paladin.
                    \spelldur{Attunement}
                \end{spelleffects}

            \cf{Pal}[15]{Greater Zealous Offense}[Magical]
            The damage bonus from the \textit{zealous offense} ability increases to \plus2d.

            \cf{Pal}[19]{Greater Unfaltering Zeal}
            The bonus to defenses from the \textit{unfaltering zeal} ability increases to \plus2.

            % If you die in the service of your devoted alignment, you may choose to have your fallen body erupt in an immense burst of divine energy.
            % If you do, your body is almost completely consumed, preventing you from being raised with \ritual{resurrection} and similar effects that require an intact body.
            % This burst has two effects.
            % First, a \spell{sunburst} spell immediately takes effect over the area where you died.
            % Second, a \spell{storm of vengeance} spell begins to take effect, centered on the same area.
            % The spell lasts for 10 rounds, and the lightning strikes target the paladin's enemies.
            % Both of these effects harm only the paladin's foes, and do not harm your allies.
            % However, your allies' vision is still impeded by the \spell{storm of vengeance}.

        \subsubsection{Ex-Paladins}
            If you cease to follow your devoted alignment, you lose all \glossterm{magical} paladin class abilities.
            If your atone for your misdeeds and resume the service of your devoted alignment, you can regain your abilities.

    \subsection{Class Abilities}
        All rogues have the following abilities.

        \cf{Rog}{Sneak Attack}
        Once per round, when a rogue hits with a physical attack against a creature unable to defend itself effectively, she can make that attack a sneak attack.
        She can make a sneak attack if your target is \unaware, \defenseless, or suffering \glossterm{overwhelm penalties} from being surrounded by enemies (see \pcref{Overwhelm}).
        A sneak attack deals 1d6 points of bonus damage.

        The extra damage dealt by a sneak attack increases by 1d6 at your 3rd rogue level and every two rogue levels thereafter.

        Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.
        A rogue can't strike with deadly accuracy from beyond that range.

        A rogue can only sneak attack creatures with a discernible body structure.
        Oozes, incorporeal creatures, and some plants lack vital areas to attack.
        Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks.
        The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot.
        A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach.
        Usually, this means she can only make sneak attacks against creatures no more than two size categories larger than your.

        \cf{Rog}[2]{Skill Talent}
        The rogue's skills improve.
        You gain an additional skill point, which she can place in any skill, and a bonus Skill feat for which you qualifie (see \pcref{Skill Feats}).

        \cf{Rog}[3]{Uncanny Dodge}
        The rogue can react to danger before your senses would normally allow your to do so.
        The rogue reduces your overwhelm penalties by 1.

        In addition, you are not \unaware when attacked by surprise.

        \cf{Rog}[4]{Combat Tricks}
        The rogue gains a combat trick to aid your and confound your foes.
        She chooses a single combat trick from the list below.
        Some combat tricks have minimum rogue levels, as indicated in the title of the ability.
        At your 8th rogue level, and every four rogue levels thereafter, the rogue gains an additional combat trick.

        Some combat tricks depend on a rogue's trick power.
        A rogue's trick power is equal to your Intelligence or your character level, whichever is higher.

        Tricks marked with an asterisk are called ambush attacks.
        Ambush attacks only function on the first sneak attack the rogue makes against a particular creature in an encounter.

        \subcf{Confusing Ambush*}
        The rogue makes a Trick power vs. Mental attack against the creature damaged by this ambush attack.
        Success means the struck creature is \dazed for 2 rounds.

        This is an ambush attack, and only works once per creature.

        \subcf{Distracting Ambush*}
        A creature damaged by this ambush attack automatically fails any Concentration checks it makes that round.
        This is an ambush attack, and only works once per creature.

        \subcf{Merciful Blows}

        \subcf{Tricky Maneuver}
        When performing a \glossterm{maneuver} against an \glossterm{overwhelmed} or \unaware creature, the rogue gains a bonus to accuracy equal to the number of sneak attack dice she would roll.
        The benefits of this trick apply even against creatures immune to critical hits.

        \subcf{8th -- Brutal Ambush*}
        The rogue rolls d8s instead of d6s for your sneak attack dice on this ambush attack.

        Success means that the target feels agonizing pain for 2 rounds.
        Whenever it takes physical damage, it takes additional physical damage equal to the rogue's trick power.
        This is an ambush attack, and only works once per creature.

        \subcf{12th -- Assassination}
        To use this ability, the rogue must spend a full round studying a creature within 100 feet of your who has not noticed your and who is not in combat.
        If she make a melee sneak attack against that target within 1 round, your attack deals maximum damage, including your sneak attack damage.
        If the target becomes aware of your presence before you attack, this ability has no benefit.

        \subcf{12th -- Perfect Precision}
        The rogue has no range limit on your sneak attacks.

        \subcf{16th -- Deadly Ambush*}

        Success means the target is \staggered, and dies if it loses all its hit points for 2 rounds.
        Critical success means the target immediately dies.
        This is an ambush attack, and only works once per creature.
        In addition, dying in this way is a \glossterm{Death} effect.

        The rogue gains an additional \glossterm{legend point}.
        Once per round, when you spend a legend point to force a foe to reroll a \glossterm{strike}, she may use this ability to treat the reroll as a 1.

        \cf{Rog}[7]{Improved Uncanny Dodge}
        The rogue reduces your overwhelm penalties by 2.
        This does not stack with the effects of uncanny dodge.
        If your overwhelm penalty is reduced to 0, you are not considered to be overwhelmed.

        \cf{Rog}[9]{Lucky Break}[Mag]
        The rogue gains an additional \glossterm{legend point}.

        \cf{Rog}[19]{Ambush Master}
        The rogue's ambush attacks function on the first attack the rogue makes against a particular creature in a single round, rather than within a single encounter.

    \subsection{Warp Damage}\label{Warp Damage}
        A spellwarped can use the innate magic within your body to generate powerful magical effects.
        However, doing so is physically taxing.
        Most spellwarped abilities cause the spellwarped to take some amount of \glossterm{warp damage}.
        Warp damage cannot be cured by effects that restore hit points, effectively reducing the spellwarped's maximum hit points.

        A spellwarped cannot voluntarily take warp damage that would exceed half your maximum hit points.
        An hour of rest cures warp damage equal to a character's level.

    \subsection{Base Class Abilities}
        A character with spellwarped as a base class gains the following abilities.

        \classbasics{Skill Points} 5.

        \classbasics{Defenses} See the Innate Magic ability below.

        \classbasics{Action Points} \plus3.

        \cf{Spl}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
        A spellwarped is proficient with simple weapons, any two weapon groups, light and medium armor, and shields.

        \cf{Spl}{Warp Regeneration}[Mag]
        The spellwarped does not need to rest to cure warp damage.
        He automatically heals warp damage equal to your level every hour, regardless of any activity he takes in the meantime.
        If he rests, he also recovers warp damage for resting, doubling the warp damage he heals.

    \subsection{Class Abilities}
        All spellwarped have the following abilities.

        \cf{Spl}{Spellpower}
        The strength of a spellwarped's spells and abilities are determined by your spellpower.
        Your spellpower is equal to your key attribute or your character level, whichever is higher.

        \cf{Spl}{Innate Magic}
        Each spellwarped draws your magical power from a particular kind of magic.
        This is a choice made when the first level of the class is taken, and it cannot thereafter be changed.
        The choices are listed below.
        Your choice of innate magic is not a \glossterm{magical} ability, but the active ability granted by that choice is a magical ability.

        \subcf{Alteration}
        The spellwarped can manipulate the physical forms of creatures.
        Your good defense is Fortitude, your key attribute is Intelligence, and he treats Disguise, Escape Artist, and Jump as class skills.
        An alteration spellwarped may be called an alterer, bodywarper, or shifter.

        As a standard action, he can change minor aspects of your appearance, such as removing a mole or lengthening your beard.
        This can grant you a \plus2 bonus to Disguise checks.
        Major changes are not possible.

        \subcf{Pyromancy}
        The spellwarped can manipulate fire and heat.
        Your good defense is Fortitude, your key attribute is Willpower, and he treats Acrobatics, Jump, and Sprint as class skills.
        A pyromancy spellwarped may be called a pyromancer.

        As a standard action, he can snap your fingers to create a small ember of flame in your hand for 5 minutes.
        This ember casts light as a torch, and can deal 1 point of fire damage with a successful touch attack.
        It can be dismissed as a swift action or extinguished as a move action.

        \subcf{Telekinesis}
        The spellwarped can manipulate objects and creatures with your mind.
        Your good defense is Mental, your key attribute is Willpower, and he treats Devices, Escape Artist, and Sleight of Hand as class skills.
        A telekinesis spellwarped may be called a telekine.

        As a standard action, he can concentrate to move objects within ten feet of you telekinetically.
        He can slowly lift or manipulate one object by up to one foot per round.
        The object can weigh up to five pounds.
        This level of control is insufficient to make skill checks or wield a weapon or shield effectively.

        \subcf{Temporal}
        The spellwarped can manipulate time.
        Your good defense is Reflex, your key attribute is Perception, and he treats Awareness, Sleight of Hand, and Sprint as class skills.
        A temporal spellwarped may be called a temporalist or timewarper.

        The spellwarped always knows exactly what time it is, and can track the passage of time precisely without effort.

        \cf{Spl}{Invocation}
        A spellwarped can invoke your innate magic to generate powerful effects.
        He chooses a single invocation at 1st level from those available based on your choice of innate magic.
        Using an invocation inflicts \glossterm{warp damage} to the spellwarped equal to half the minimum spellwarped level required to learn the invocation (minimum 1).

        At your 4th spellwarped level, and every two spellwarped levels thereafter, you gain an additional invocation.
        Some invocations have minimum spellwarped levels, as indicated in the title of the ability.
        The list of invocations is given at \pcref{Invocations}.

        The spellwarped's accuracy with invocations is equal to your spellpower.

        \cf{Spl}[2]{Spellwarped Body}[Mag]
        The spellwarped's body is fundamentally altered by exposure to magic.
        He shows signs of the magic coursing through your body: strangely or inconsistently colored hair, natural skin markings which often resemble runes, and so on.
        Anyone observing the spellwarped can make an Awareness or Spellcraft check with a DR equal to 20 \sub your spellwarped level to recognize that the character is a spellwarped.
        Critical success on the check allows the observer to determine the type of innate magic the spellwarped has.
        In addition, the spellwarped gains an ability based on your innate magic.
        \subcf{Alteration -- Sturdy Body}
        The spellwarped gains a \plus2 bonus to your Fortitude defense.
        This bonus increases by 1 at spellpower 5 and every 5 spellpower thereafter.
        \subcf{Pyromancy -- Energy Resistance}
        The spellwarped gains \glossterm{damage reduction} against cold and fire damage equal to twice your spellpower.
        \subcf{Telekinesis -- Tactile Telekinesis}
        The spellwarped gains a \plus2 bonus to Strength and Dexterity-based checks.
        This bonus increases by 1 at spellpower 5 and every 5 spellpower thereafter.
        \subcf{Temporal -- Accelerated Movement}
        The spellwarped gains a \plus2 bonus to your Reflex defense and a \plus10 foot bonus to your movement speed.
        At spellpower 8, 14, and 20, the defense bonus increases by 1 and the speed bonus increases by 10 feet.

        \cf{Spl}[3]{Magical Senses}[Mag]
        The spellwarped learns to recognize the telltale signs of your chosen magic.
        He must concentrate as a standard action to use this ability, and he may do so any number of times per day.
        \subcf{Alteration -- Perceive Alteration}
        The spellwarped can discern the true form of all creatures within 50 feet of you for 1 round, ignoring any effects which magically alter their shapes.
        This also grants you a \plus5 bonus to Awareness checks to see through disguises.
        \subcf{Pyromancy -- Flame of Life}
        The spellwarped can see the life-fire that lies within all living creatures, allowing you to clearly see all living creatures within 50 feet of you for 1 round.
        It also allows the spellwarped to see unusually warm objects, such as fires.
        This is a \glossterm{Detection} ability, and it can penetrate up to 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.
        \subcf{Telekinesis -- Spatial Awareness}
        The spellwarped can feel the forms of all objects and creatures around you, granting blindsense out to a 50 foot range for 1 round.
        \subcf{Temporal -- Rapid Search}
        The spellwarped can accelerate your mind to immediately search everything within a 10 foot radius of you with the Awareness skill as a standard action.
        Alternately, he may use this ability to read a book ten times as fast as normal.

        \cf{Spl}[3]{Spellwarped Aspect}[Mag]
        The spellwarped gains a new ability based on your continued exposure to magical energy.
        Most aspects are specific to particular kinds of innate magic, but some aspects can be taken by any spellwarped.
        These aspects are listed under the General heading.

        At your 7th spellwarped level, and every four spellwarped levels thereafter, the spellwarped gains an additional spellwarped aspect.
        Some aspects require a minimum spellwarped level, as indicated in the title of the ability.
        The full list of spellwarped aspects is given below.

        \parhead{General}

        \subcf{Resilient}
        The spellwarped increases the defense improved by your choice of innate magic by 2.
        This can increase your hit points, if appropriate.
        \subcf{Spellwarped Ritualist} The spellwarped can learn and perform rituals as if he were an arcane caster with a spellpower equal to your spellwarped spellpower.  The maximum level of ritual that he can learn or perform is equal to half your spellwarped level or half your spellwarped key attribute, whichever is lower.
        In addition, you gain an ability based on which type of spellwarped you are.
        \begin{itemize}
            \itemhead{Alteration} If a ritual requires a specific component with a value, the spellwarped can substitute its equivalent value in ritual components instead.
                This cannot be used to replace components without a value or components with special properties that alter the ritual's effect, such as the body for a \spell{resurrection} ritual.
            \itemhead{Pyromancy}
                The spellwarped can use any combustable item as a ritual component.
                It can replace an amount of normal ritual components equal to the value of the item.
                It cannot replace special ritual components.
            \itemhead{Telekinesis}
                The spellwarped can perform rituals from up to 30 feet away from the ritual components.
            \itemhead{Temporal}

        \end{itemize}
        \subcf{7th -- Warp Overload}
        The spellwarped can voluntarily take \glossterm{warp damage}, even if that would exceed half your maximum hit points.

        \subcf{11th -- Persistent Senses}
        The spellwarped can constantly gain the benefit of your magical senses ability.
        He can toggle your enhanced senses on or off as a swift action.
        If the ability does not have a duration, such as the temporal magical senses ability, this aspect has no effect.

        \cf{Spl}[2]{Surge of Power}[Mag]
        \subcf{Telekinesis -- Kinetic Deflection}
        The spellwarped reflexively deflects attacks away with your mind.

        \subcf{7th -- Damage Reduction}
        The spellwarped gains \glossterm{damage reduction} against physical damage equal to your spellpower.
        Adamantine weapons ignore this damage reduction and negate it for 1 round.
        \subcf{11th -- Alter Size}
        As a standard action, the spellwarped can grow or shrink by one size category, up to a maximum of one size category different from your normal size.
        This effect lasts until he uses this ability again.
        This is a \glossterm{Sizing} effect, and does not stack with other Sizing effects.
        \subcf{11th -- Regeneration}

        \subcf{11th -- Intense Flame}
        The spellwarped gains a bonus to fire damage with all invocations equal to the number of dice he would roll for that invocation's fire damage.

        \parhead{Telekinesis}
        \subcf{Kinetic Deflection}

        When the spellwarped uses your object manipulation ability, he can affect objects within 10 feet, with a weight limit of up to two pounds per spellpower.
        He has enough control to make checks with a DR of up to 10.
        \subcf{7th -- Force Barrier}
        The spellwarped gains a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{physical defenses}.
        \subcf{7th -- Shieldbearer}
        The spellwarped may wield shields, except tower shields, telekinetically.
        The shield floats in your square, granting you its bonus to your physical defenses just as if he were wielding it.
        You do not need a free hand to wield the shield, and suffer no arcane spell failure for its use, though you are still affected by its \glossterm{encumbrance penalty}.
        The shield follows you as he moves.
        If it is forcibly removed from your square, he loses control over it and it falls to the ground.
        \subcf{11th -- Mind Armory}
        The spellwarped may control a number of weapons equal to half your Intelligence with your mind blade ability.
        This does not allow you to make additional attacks per round, but he may attack interchangeably with any weapon he controls.
        Each weapon threatens an area and contributes to overwhelm penalties, just as with your normal mind blade ability.

        \parhead{Temporal}
        \subcf{Accelerate Mind}
        The spellwarped gains a \plus2 bonus to Intelligence-based and Perception-based checks.

        The spellwarped can react to danger before your senses would normally allow you to do so.
        He reduces your overwhelm penalties by 1.
        If your overwhelm penalty is reduced to 0, you are not considered to be overwhelmed.
        In addition, you are not \unaware when attacked by surprise.
        \subcf{7th -- Improved Uncanny Dodge}
        The spellwarped reduces your overwhelm penalties by 2.
        If your overwhelm penalty is reduced to 0, you are not considered to be overwhelmed.
        \subcf{15th -- Accelerate Attack}
        Whenever the spellwarped makes a \glossterm{standard attack}, he can make an additional \glossterm{strike} at a \minus5 penalty.
        This does not stack with any other effects which grant extra strikes.

        \cf{Spl}[5]{Manipulate Magic}[Su]
        The spellwarped can channel your innate magic to manipulate magical abilities.
        Using this ability causes the spellwarped to take \glossterm{warp damage} equal to half the \glossterm{power} of the target ability.
        \subcf{Alteration -- Absorption}
        As an immediate action, when the spellwarped makes successfully resists an attack against your Fortitude from a magical ability, he may absorb the magic harmlessly into your body.
        It has no effect on you, even if it would normally have an effect on a failed attack.
        \subcf{Pyromancy -- Fuel the Flame}
        As an immediate action, when you are affected by a magical ability, he may channel its energy into a burst of flame around you.
        Enemies within a \areamed radius of the spellwarped take fire damage equal to your spellpower.
        The spell still has its normal effect on the spellwarped.
        \subcf{Telekinesis -- Mind over Matter}
        As an immediate action, when you are subject to an attack against your Fortitude from a magical ability, he may use your Mental defense instead.
        \subcf{Temporal -- Accelerate Magic}
        As a swift action, the spellwarped can halve the duration of any magical ability affecting you.
        This can end the effect immediately if it has less than one round remaining.
        If this would reduce the duration by more than one day, the duration is instead reduced by one day.

        \cf{Spl}[9]{Magic Resistance}[Mag]
        The magic within the spellwarped allows you to completely ignore other magic, granting you \glossterm{magic resistance} equal to 10 \add your Constitution or level, whichever is higher.

        \cf{Spl}[13]{Improved Manipulate Magic}[Mag]
        The spellwarped can use your manipulate magic ability to affect any ally within \rngmed range of you.

    \subsection{Invocations}\label{Invocations}

        All invocations are \glossterm{magical} abilities unless otherwise noted.

        Some invocations mimic the effects of spells.
        The spellwarped's spellpower with these effects is equal to your spellpower with the spellwarped class.

        \subsubsection{Alteration Invocations}
            \subcf{1st -- Body Bludgeon}
            The spellwarped distorts a part of your body and strikes a foe with it.
            He makes a Spellpower vs. Armor defense physical attack against a foe within your \glossterm{reach}.
            This attack scores critical hits like other physical attacks.
            Success means the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per two spellpower \add half your Strength.
            Failure means the target takes half damage.
            \par At your 4th spellwarped level, this damage increases to 1d6 bludgeoning damage per spellpower \add half your Strength.
            \subcf{1st -- Shrink}
            This invocation functions like the \spell{shrink} spell.

            \subcf{4th -- Enlarge}

            If he identify the effects on you, such as with a Spellcraft check, he may freely choose which effect to end.
            If he cannot differentiate the effects, choose the effect ended randomly.

            \subcf{6th -- Amorphous Body}
            The spellwarped transforms your body into an amorphous form for \durshort duration.
            In this form, you gain several benefits.

            \subcf{6th -- Healing Transformation}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped can heal a creature within \rngclose range by transforming it into a healthier version of its normal body.
            The target heals 1d6 points of damage per spellpower.
            This also removes any of the following conditions: blinded, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, sickened, and poisoned.
            \subcf{6th -- Mighty Throw}
            This invocation functions like the \spell{mighty throw} spell.

            \subcf{8th -- Bludgeon the Horde}
            This attack functions like the body bludgeon attack, except that the spellwarped may attack all foes within your reach, as if he were wielding a reach weapon.
            Success deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage per two spellpower \add half your Strength.
            Failure deals half damage.
            \subcf{8th -- Flight}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped can grow wings that last for 5 rounds.
            The wings grant you a fly speed equal to your land speed.
            While \unencumbered, he can fly (see \pcref{Flying}).
            He can only fly for a number of rounds equal to half your spellpower, even if he uses this ability again to extend the duration of the wings.
            After that limit is reached, he must rest for 5 minutes before flying again.

            \subcf{12th -- Reinforced Flight}
            This functions like the flight invocation, except that the spellwarped can fly while encumbered.

        \subsubsection{Pyromancy Invocations}
            Unless otherwise noted, a pyromancer's invocations are \glossterm{Fire} effects, and shed light equivalent to a torch for their duration.

            \subcf{1st -- Burn}
            The spellwarped makes a Spellpower vs. Reflex defense attack against a foe within \rngmed range.
            Success means the target takes \spelldamage{fire}[d6].
            Critical success deals double damage.
            Failure means the target takes half damage.
            \par At your 4th spellwarped level, this damage increases to \spelldamage{fire}.
            \subcf{1st -- Flame Weapon}
            As a swift action, the spellwarped can create a weapon made of flame that lasts for 5 rounds.
            The weapon is sized appropriately for you, and may take the form of any weapon you are proficient with.
            He can attack with the weapon as if it were a normal weapon of its type, except that you use your spellpower to determine your damage in place of your level or Strength, and all damage dealt with the weapon is fire damage.
            All other damage modifiers apply normally.
            \par If the flame weapon leaves your hand, it is extinguished 1 round later.

            \subcf{4th -- Fiery Protection}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped can bestow fire and cold damage reduction equal to twice your spellpower on a creature within 30 feet of you.

            \subcf{4th -- Flame Shield}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped can wreath a willing creature within \rngclose range in flame for \durshort duration.
            Whenever a creature makes a melee attack against the target, the attacking creature takes \spelldamage{fire}[d6].
            A creature can only be dealt damage by this spell once per round.

            \subcf{6th -- Conflagration}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped can release a powerful explosion of flame.
            He makes a Spellpower vs. Reflex attack against everything within a \areamed radius burst of you.
            Success against a target means it takes \spelldamage{fire}[d8].
            Critical success deals double damage.
            Failure against a target means it takes half damage.
            \subcf{6th -- Fireball}
            This invocation functions like the \spell{fireball} spell.
            \subcf{6th -- Ignite}
            The spellwarped makes a Spellpower vs. Reflex attack against a foe within \rngclose range.
            Success means the target takes \spelldamage{fire}, and is \ignited for 2 rounds.
            Critical success deals double damage.
            Failure means the target takes half damage, but is still ignited.

            \subcf{8th -- Firestride}
            As a move action, the spellwarped can teleport to any active flame of at least Tiny size within \rngmed range.
            When you do so, he immolates himself and disappears into a pile of ash before stepping out from the flame unharmed.
            An ordinary torch is sufficient flame to teleport to, but not a candle.
            \subcf{8th -- Flameheart}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped can become a being of pure fire for \durshort duration.
            In this form, you are immune to physical damage and can pass through openings as small as one inch at no movement penalty.
            However, he cannot attack normally or use any of your items, as they meld into your body.
            He may use any of your invocations normally.
            In addition, as a standard action, he can make a Spellpower vs. Reflex attack to touch a creature.
            Success means the target takes \spelldamage{fire}.
            Critical success deals double damage.
            \subcf{8th -- Flight of the Phoenix}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped can create wings of flame that last for 5 rounds.
            The wings grant you a fly speed equal to your land speed.
            While \unencumbered, he can fly (see \pcref{Flying}).
            \subcf{10th -- Lifeseeking Flame}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped fires an orb of flame at a target within \rnglong range.
            If you do not target a creature, the flame automatically strikes a living creature within range.
            It is able to unerringly strike creatures you cannot see or are not aware of, including invisible or concealed creatures.
            You can direct the orb to avoid specific targets, allowing you to strike a hidden foe among your allies.
            If there is no valid target, the orb dissipates harmlessly.
            \par The struck target takes 1d10 fire damage per two spellpower.

            \subcf{14th -- Immolation}
            This invocation functions like the \spell{immolation} spell.

            \subcf{18th -- Phoenix Revival}
            When the spellwarped takes vital damage, he may ignore the damage as an immediate action, even if the vital damage would be sufficient to kill you.
            If you do, he dissolves into a pile of ash for 2 rounds.
            During this time, he can take no actions.
            If the pile of ash remains intact after 2 rounds, you are restored to your normal body.
            He has no hit points remaining, and warp damage equal to half your maximum hit points, but is healed of all vital damage.
            However, if the pile of ash is dispersed, the spellwarped dies.
            The ash cannot be harmed by fire damage, and if the pile of ash would take at least 50 points of fire damage during a round, the spellwarped returns one round sooner.
            You may take your normal actions in the round after you are restored.
            \par After using this ability, the spellwarped cannot use it again for 1 hour.

            \subcf{20th -- Immolate}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped makes a Spellpower vs. Fortitude against a foe within \rngclose range to consume it in flames from the inside out.
            Success deals \spelldamageemp{fire}.

            Failure deals half damage.

        \subsubsection{Telekinesis Invocations}
            \subcf{1st -- Mind Crush}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped can make a Spellpower vs. Fortitude attack against a creature within \rngclose range.
            Success means the target takes \spelldamage{bludgeoning}[d6] and is \sickened for 2 rounds.
            Critical success deals double damage.
            Failure means the target takes half damage, but is still sickened.
            \par At your 4th spellwarped level, this damage increases to \spelldamage{bludgeoning}.
            \subcf{1st -- Mind Blade}
            As a swift action, the spellwarped can telekinetically wield an unattended weapon within \rngclose range for 5 rounds.
            The weapon must be a light or medium weapon appropriate for your size.
            This allows you to attack with the weapon just as if he were holding it in one hand, except that you use your spellpower in place of your Strength or Dexterity.
            In all other respects, this functions as if he were wielding the weapon normally, including contributing to overwhelm penalties.
            The weapon floats in midair and threatens all squares adjacent to it.
            As a move action, he may move the weapon up to 30 feet in any direction, even vertically.
            If the weapon goes outside of \rngclose range, he loses control of it and it falls to the ground.

            \subcf{4th -- Dual Mind Blade}
            This invocation functions like your mind blade invocation, except that the spellwarped may wield two weapons at once.
            They must stay in the same space, and he may make two-weapon fighting attacks with the weapons, just as if he was wielding them with two hands.
            \subcf{4th -- Mighty Mind Blade}
            This invocation functions like the mind blade invocation, except that the spellwarped may also use a heavy weapon appropriate for your size, allowing you to attack with it just as if he were holding it in two hands.

            \subcf{6th -- Distant Manipulation}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped can mentally manipulate objects and creatures at up to \rngclose range for up to 5 rounds.
            This allows you to take any actions which he could normally take with your hands, using your spellpower in place of your Strength or Dexterity, as appropriate.

            \subcf{8th -- Immobilize}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped can make a creature within \rngmed range of you \immobilized for 2 rounds.

            \subcf{10th -- Telekinetic Blast}
            This invocation functions like the \spell{telekinetic blast} spell.

        \subsubsection{Temporal Invocations}
            Unless otherwise noted, all temporal invocations are \glossterm{Temporal} effects.

            \subcf{Decelerate}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped can attempt to slow a creature down.
            He makes a Spellpower vs. Mental attack against a creature within \rngmed range.
            Success means the target is \immobilized for 2 rounds.
            Failure means it moves at half speed for 2 rounds.
            \subcf{Timelock}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped can attempt to lock a creature in time.
            He makes a Spellpower vs. Mental attack against an adjacent creature.
            Success means the target slips out of time for 1 round.
            During that time, it can take no actions, but cannot be harmed, moved, or affected in any way.
            Critical success means it slips selectively out of time for 1 round.
            During that time, it can take no actions, but can be harmed or moved as normal.
            It is not considered \helpless.
            \par A creature affected by this ability is immune to the effect for 5 rounds, even if the attack failed.

            \subcf{4th -- Disjointed Time}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped chaotically disrupts the local flow of time of a creature within \rngclose range.
            The target is \impaired with attacks and checks for 5 rounds.
            \subcf{4th -- Haste}
            This invocation functions like the \spell{haste} spell.

            \subcf{6th -- Flash Step}
            As a move action, the spellwarped can accelerate a willing creature within \rngclose range so much that he can seem to pause time for everyone but the target.
            This allows the target to immediately take a single move action.
            During this move action, the target moves at double speed, cannot be followed or withdrawn from, and may move through squares occupied by creatures or threatened by blocking enemies without penalty.
            The target still suffers the effects of any environmental hazards.
            \subcf{6th -- Slow}
            This invocation functions like the \spell{slow} spell.

            \subcf{8th -- Inhuman Speed}
            As a move action, the spellwarped can accelerate himself to immense speed, allowing you to move up to five times your speed.
            During this time, he cannot be followed or withdrawn from, can move through squares occupied by enemies or threatened by blocking enemies without penalty, and can treat liquids as if they were solid ground.

            \subcf{10th -- Timestream}
            The spellwarped manipulates time in a \arealarge, 10 ft.\ wide line-shaped zone that extends out from you for 5 rounds.
            All creatures and objects that pass through the line are \slowed for 1 round.
            The spellwarped can exclude your allies from the effect.
            The timestream is virtually invisible, requiring a DR 30 Awareness check to notice in a clear environment, though objects passing through the effect can make it more obvious.
            \subcf{10th -- Mass Haste}
            This invocation functions like the \spell{haste} spell with the Mass augment applied.

            \subcf{12th -- Mass Flash Step}
            This invocation functions like the flashstep invocation, except that it affects up to five willing creatures.
            \subcf{12th -- Mass Slow}
            This invocation functions like the \spell{slow} spell with the Mass augment applied.

            \subcf{16th -- Time Reversal}
            As a swift action, the spellwarped can take one warp damage to create a ``time lock.'' The time lock persists for one round.
            As a standard action, he can take eight warp damage to make a Spellpower vs. Mental attack a creature within \rngmed range to reverse time for it.
            Success means the target is restored to its exact condition at the point immediately after the time lock was created.
            The effects of any actions that the creature took in the intervening time are undone, any damage it dealt or took is removed, it is returned to its original location, and the creature is restored in all other ways, just as if the intervening time had never occured.
            If its original location is occupied, the time reversal fails.
            The spellwarped cannot reverse time for himself in this way.
            \par After reversing time in this way, the spellwarped must wait 5 rounds before he can create a time lock or reverse time again.
            \subcf{16th -- Supreme Acceleration}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped can accelerate himself so much that he can take an additional round of actions immediately.
            During this round, all creatures he attacks are treated as \helpless, but he cannot perform a \glossterm{coup de grace} or similar ability; such an act requires more care and precision than is possible with such immense speed.
            After using this ability, he must wait 5 rounds before he can use it again.

            \subcf{18th -- Time Stop}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped can step into an alternate timestream, causing you to speed up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen.
            He can act for 1d3\plus1 rounds of apparent time.
            During this time, all objects and creatures are frozen in place and are completely invulnerable to the spellwarped, though he may affect them with invocations normally.
            After using this ability, he must wait 5 rounds before he can use it again.

\section{Multiclass Characters}\label{Multiclass Characters}
    A character may add new classes as he or you progress in level, thus becoming a multiclass character.
    The class abilities from a character's different classes combine to determine a multiclass character's overall abilities.
    Multiclassing improves a character's versatility at the expense of focus.

    \subsection{Class And Level Features}
        As a general rule, the abilities of a multiclass character are the sum
        of the abilities of each of the character's classes.

        \parhead{Level}
        ``Character level'' is a character's total number of levels.
        It is used to determine when feats and attribute score boosts are gained, as noted on \tref{Character Advancement}.
        Whenever a creature's ``level'' is specified, without reference to a particular class, the character level is used.

        \par ``Class level'' is a character's level in a particular class.
        For a character whose levels are all in the same class, character level and class level are the same.

        \parhead{Hit Points}
        The normal rules for determining hit points apply to multiclass characters.

        \parhead{Defenses}
        The normal rules for determining defenses apply to multiclass characters.

        \parhead{Skills}
        A multiclass character gains all class skills from all of your classes.
        However, only the character's base class grants skill points.
        If a character has multiple base classes, he must choose which base class grants skill points.
        When a character gains new class skills, he may redistribute your skill points to gain training or mastery in your new class skills.

        \parhead{Class Abilities}
        A multiclass character gets all the class abilities of all your or your classes, but must also suffer the consequences of the special restrictions of all your or your classes.

        \par In some cases, two classes can have virtually identical abilities.
        Use the following guidelines to determine how abilities stack.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If two identical class abilities are not based on level and are not gained following a specific pattern, they do not stack.
            \item If two identical class abilities are not explicitly based on level, but both classes gain them in a predictable pattern, the levels of the two classes stack for determining when the next improvement to the class ability will be gained.
            \item If two identical class abilities are explicitly based on level, the levels of the two classes stack for determining the power of the ability.
            \item If two identical class abilities say how they stack, those rules trump any other rules.
        \end{itemize}
        These are some examples of how to use these guidelines.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Both a druid and a ranger gain wild speech.
                A druid/ranger who has wild speech from both classes has the same wild speech ability as a druid or ranger would.
            \item Both a barbarian and a rogue get uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge at the same level.
                A barbarian/rogue adds your barbarian and rogue levels together to determine when he acquires improved uncanny dodge.
        \end{itemize}

        \parhead{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
        Only a character's base class grants weapon and armor proficiencies.
        If a character has multiple base classes, she must choose which base class grants weapon and armor profiencies.
