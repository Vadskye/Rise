\chapter{Classes}\label{Classes}

Your character's class represents the things your character has chosen to train in.
This choice determines a great deal about your character's abilities.

\section{How Classes Work}
    When you first create a character, you choose a class.
    Your character has one level in that class.
    This grants your character all of the abilities your chosen class grants at 1st level, as given in the class description.
    Each time your character gains a level, you can choose to increase your level in your original class or gain a level in a new class.
    This grants your character all of the abilities your chosen class grants at the level your character just gained in it.

    \subsection{Base Classes}
        Every character has one \glossterm{base class}.
        You may choose any class your character has at least one level in as a base class.
        Whenever your character gain a level, you can change its base class to a different class it has.
        Your choice of base class affects your character's \glossterm{defenses}, \glossterm{skill points}, and \glossterm{class skills}.
        In addition, every class grants additional abilities if it is chosen as a base class, as given in the class description.

\section{Class Introductions}

    There are eleven classes in Rise.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Barbarians are mighty warriors who can enter a deadly battlerage.
        \item Clerics are divine spellcasters who draw power from their veneration of a deity or ideal.
        \item Druids are nature spellcasters who draw power from their veneration of the natural world.
        \item Fighters are highly disciplined warriors who excel in physical combat of any variety.
        \item Wizards are arcane spellcasters who wield the mystic forces of magic to create almost any effect.
        \item Monks are agile masters of ``\ki'' who hone their personal abilities to strike down foes and perform supernatural feats.
        \item Paladins are divinely empowered warriors whose devotion to an alignment grants them the ability to discern and smite their foes.
        \item Rangers are skilled hunters who bridge the divide between nature and civilization.
        \item Rogues are exceptionally skillful characters known for their ability to strike at their foe's weak points in combat.
        \item Spellwarped wield a unique blend of martial skill and narrowly focused magical abilities.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Class Description Format}
        Each class is described from the perspective of a member of that class, using ``you'' in the description.

        \parhead{Class Table}
        The class's table describes the special abilities they get at each level.

        \parhead{Alignment}
        Some classes require specific alignments (see \pcref{Alignment}).
        Most classes allow characters of any alignment.

        \parhead{Class Skills}
        These are skills that members of this class are typically good at (see \pcref{Skills}).

        \subsubsection{Base Class Abilities}
            Abilities contained within this heading only apply to characters with the current class as a \glossterm{base class}.

            \parhead{Skill Points}
            This is the number of skill points that members of this class get.

            \parhead{Defenses}
            Each class grants bonuses to specific defenses.
            These bonuses do not stack with other defense bonuses granted by base classes.
            If a character has multiple base classes, use the highest bonuses that apply to each defense.

            \parhead{Weapon and Armor Proficiencies}
            These are the types of equipment that members of this class are trained in using.

        \subsubsection{Class Abilities}

        \subsubsection{Spellcasting}

            \cf{Clr}{Divine Spells} 
            You can cast divine spells using your devotion to your deity.
            You learn two divine spells from the divine \glossterm{spell list} (see \pcref{Divine Spells}).
            Your \glossterm{spellpower} with divine spells is equal to your \glossterm{divine power}.

            To cast a spell, you must normally spend an \glossterm{action point}.
            Every spell can also be cast as a cantrip.
            Cantrips are weaker, but do not require action points to cast.

            You can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to your own or your deity's.
            Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the \glossterm{Chaos}, \glossterm{Good}, \glossterm{Evil}, and \glossterm{Law} tags in their spell descriptions.

            \cf{Clr}{Rituals} 
            You can perform divine rituals to create unique magical effects (see \pcref{Rituals}).
            You have a ritual book containing two divine rituals of your choice (see \pcref{Divine Rituals}).

            \cf{Clr}[6]{Standard Augment}
            Choose one of the \glossterm{standard augments} (see \pcref{Standard Augments}).
            You can apply that augment to divine spells you cast.

            \cf{Clr}[10]{Standard Augment}
            Choose one of the \glossterm{standard augments} (see \pcref{Standard Augments}).

                        \spellsuccess The target is unable to break the laws that apply in the area, and any attempt to do so simply fails.
                        The laws which are applied are those which are most appropriate for the area, regardless of whether the cleric or any other creature know those laws.
                        In areas under ambiguous or nonexistent government, this ability may have unexpected effects, or it may have no effect at all.

                    The belief may be a lie that you told it, or even a simple misunderstanding (such as believing a hidden creature is not present in a room).
                    If the creature does not already hold the chosen belief, this ability automatically fails.
                \end{spelltargetinginfo}

                        It will interpret any evidence that the falsehood is incorrect to be somehow wrong -- an illusion, a conspiracy to decieve it, or any other reason it can think of to continue believing the falsehood.
                        At the end of the effect, the creature can decide whether it believes the falsehood or not, as normal.

        \subsubsection{War}
            \parhead{Gift} You gain proficiency with heavy armor, tower shields, and an additional weapon group of your choice.
            \parhead{Aspect} You gain a \plus1d bonus to damage with \glossterm{strikes}.
            \parhead{Essence} Whenever you cast a spell, you can use this ability as an \glossterm{immediate action} by spending an \glossterm{action point}.
            If you do, the spell gains one of the following effects:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Legion: If the spell would normally affect five or more specific targets, its range is doubled and it instead affects five times that many targets.
                \item Selective: If the spell has an area, it has no effect on your allies in the area.
                \item Widened: If the spell has an area, the size of the area is doubled.
            \end{itemize}
            \parhead{Mastery} You and all allies within a \arealarge radius emanation of you gain a \plus1d bonus to damage with \glossterm{strikes}.

        \subsubsection{Water}
            \parhead{Gift} You add Swim to your cleric class skill list and gain a \plus5 bonus to Swim checks.
            \parhead{Aspect} You can breathe water as easily as a human breathes air, preventing you from drowning or suffocating underwater.
            You also gain a \glossterm{swim speed} equal to your land speed.
            \parhead{Essence} As a standard action, you can spend an \glossterm{action point} to use this ability.
            \begin{ability}
                \begin{spelltargetinginfo}
                    \spellrng{\rnglong}

                \begin{spelleffects}
                    \spelleffect You can speak with and command water within range.
                    You can ask the water simple questions and understand its responses.
                    If you command the water to perform a task, it will do so do the best of its ability until this effect ends.
                    You cannot compel the water to move faster than 30 feet per round.
                    \spelldur Sustain (swift)
                    \spellspecial After you use this ability on a particular area of water, you cannot use it again on that same area for 24 hours.
                \end{spelleffects}
            \end{ability}
            \parhead{Mastery}
            Whenever you move, you can transform yourself into a rushing flow of water with a volume roughly equal to your normal volume until your movement is complete
            In this form, you may move wherever water could go, you cannot take other actions, such as jumping, attacking, or casting spells.
            You may move through squares occupied by creatures or threatened by blocking enemies without penalty.
            \par Your speed is halved when moving uphill and doubled when moving downhill.
            Unusually steep inclines may cause greater movement differences while in this form.
            \par If the water is split, you may reform from anywhere the water has reached, to as little as a single ounce of water.
            If not even an ounce of water exists contiguously, your body reforms from all of the largest available sections of water, cut into pieces of appropriate size.
            This usually causes you to die.

        \subsubsection{Wild}
            \parhead{Gift} You add Creature Handling, Knowledge (nature), and Survival to your cleric class skill list.
            In addition, you gain two skill points which must be spent on any combination of those skills.
            % Does this even make sense?
            \parhead{Aspect} When you gain this ability, you choose one wild aspect ability, as if you were a druid of a level equal to your cleric level (see Wild Aspect, \pref{Drd:Wild Aspect}).
            As a standard action, you can spend an \glossterm{action point} to embody that wild aspect for 1 hour.

        \subsubsection{Ex-Clerics}
            If you grossly violate the code of conduct required by your deity, you lose all spells and magical cleric class abilities.
            You cannot regain those abilities until you atone (see the \spell{atonement} ritual).

        \classbasics{Defenses} \plus4 Fortitude, \plus2 Mental.

        \classbasics{Action Points} \plus3.

        \cf{Drd}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
        Druids are proficient with simple weapons, any one other weapon group, scimitars, sickles, and slings.
        In addition, druids are proficient with light armor, medium armor, and shields.
        However, a druid cannot use metal armor; see the Metal Abhorrence ability, below.

    \subsection{Class Abilities}
        If you are a druid, you have the following abilities.

        \cf{Drd}{Druidic Language}
        You know Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, in addition to your normal languages.
        Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.
        Druidic has its own alphabet.

        \cf{Drd}{Metal Abhorrence}
        The oaths that you swear as part of your druidic initiation prohibit you from wearing armor made of metal.
        If you wear prohibited armor or carry a prohibited shield, you are unable to cast druid spells or use any of your \glossterm{magical} druid abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.
        
        You can avoid this penalty by using armor made of wood altered with the \spell{ironwood} ritual.
        Such wood is as strong as steel.

        \cf{Drd}{Nature Power}
        The \glossterm{power} of your druid spells and abilities is determined by your \textit{nature power}.
        Your \textit{nature power} is equal to your level or your Perception, whichever is higher.

        \subsubsection{Spellcasting}

            \cf{Drd}{Nature Spells} 
            You can cast nature spells using your devotion to your deity.
            You learn two nature spells from the nature \glossterm{spell list} (see \pcref{Nature Spells}).
            Your \glossterm{spellpower} with nature spells is equal to your \glossterm{nature power}.

            To cast a spell, you must normally spend an \glossterm{action point}.
            Every spell can also be cast as a cantrip.
            Cantrips are weaker, but do not require action points to cast.

            You can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to your own or your deity's.
            Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the \glossterm{Chaos}, \glossterm{Good}, \glossterm{Evil}, and \glossterm{Law} tags in their spell descriptions.

            \cf{Drd}{Rituals} 
            You can perform nature rituals to create unique magical effects (see \pcref{Rituals}).
            You have a ritual book containing two nature rituals of your choice (see \pcref{Nature Rituals}).

            \cf{Drd}[6]{Standard Augment}
            Choose one of the \glossterm{standard augments} (see \pcref{Standard Augments}).
            You can apply that augment to nature spells you cast.

            \cf{Drd}[10]{Standard Augment}
            Choose one of the \glossterm{standard augments} (see \pcref{Standard Augments}).
            You can apply that augment to nature spells you cast.

            \cf{Drd}[14]{Standard Augment}
            Choose one of the \glossterm{standard augments} (see \pcref{Standard Augments}).
            You can apply that augment to nature spells you cast.

            \cf{Drd}[18]{Spell Point} 
            You gain a spell point.
            A spell point can be spent to cast spells in place of an action point.
            You recover all spent spell points after a \glossterm{short rest}.

        \subsubsection{Natural Influence}

            \cf{Drd}{Wild Speech}[Magical] As a standard action, you can spend an \glossterm{action point} to use this ability.
            \begin{ability}
                \begin{spelltargetinginfo}
                    \spellquicktargeting{One animal}{\rngmed}
                \end{spelltargetinginfo}
                \begin{spelleffects}
                    \spelleffect You can speak to and understand the speech of the target animal, and any other animals of the same species.
                    This ability doesn't make the target any more friendly or cooperative than normal.
                    Wary and cunning animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while stupid ones tend to make inane comments and are unlikely to say or understand anything of use.
                    \spelldur Sustain (swift)
                \end{spelleffects}
            \end{ability}

            \cf{Drd}[2]{Natural Lore}
            You gain two extra skill points which must be spent on the Creature Handling, Heal, Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (nature), Ride, Survival skills.

            \cf{Drd}[3]{Wild Aspect}[Magical]
            You gain the ability to embody an aspect of an animal or of nature itself.
            Choose a single wild aspect from the list below.
            Many wild aspects have a minimum level prerequisite, as indicated in the title of the ability.
            That ability is normally active.
            You may suppress or resume the effects of any number of \textit{wild aspects} you have as a \glossterm{swift action}.

            The abilities in the list below describe the effects of the aspect.
            Your appearance also changes to match the aspect's effects, but the nature of this change is not described.
            Different druids change in different ways.
            For example, one druid might gain unusually large eyes when embodying the low-light vision aspect, while another might change their irises into slits, like a cat, when embodying the same aspect.
            You choose how your appearance changes when you gain a wild aspect.
            This change cannot be used to gain an additional substantive benefit beyond the effects given in the description of the aspect.

            Many wild aspects grant natural weapons.
            See \pcref{Natural Weapons}, for details about natural weapons.
            At 7th level, and every four levels thereafter, you gain an additional wild aspect.

            \subcf{Armaments of the Bear}
            Your mouth and hands transform, allowing you to perform bite and claw attacks.

            \subcf{Gore}
            Your head transforms, allowing you to perform a gore attack.
            The attack deals 1d8 damage for a Medium druid.

            \subcf{Monkey Climb}
            You gain a \glossterm{climb speed} equal to your land speed.
            \subcf{Senses}
            You gain low-light vision.
            You treat sources of light as if they had double their normal illumination range.
            If you already have low-light vision, you double its benefit, allowing you to treat sources of light as if they had four times their normal illumination range.
            In addition, you gain \glossterm{darkvision} out to 50 feet, allowing you to see in complete darkness.
            If you already have darkvision, you increase its range by 50 feet.
            \subcf{Woodland Stride}
            You may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at your normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.
            The plants bend of their own volition to allow the druid to pass.
            However, plants magically manipulated to impede motion still affect your.

            \subcf{7th -- A Thousand Faces}
            You may use your spellpower in place of your Disguise skill when making Disguise checks to alter your own appearance.

            \subcf{7th -- Hawk}
            You grow wings, granting your a glide speed equal to your land speed.

            You gain the ability to move on all four limbs.
            When doing so, you gain a \plus30 foot bonus to your land speed, up to a maximum of double your original speed.
            When not using your hands to move, your ability to use your hands is unchanged.
            Descending to four legs and rising up to stand on two legs again does not take an action.
            \subcf{7th -- Scent}
            You gain the \glossterm{scent} ability.
            \subcf{7th -- Shrink}

            % \subcf{7th -- Spikes}
            % Whenever a creature adjacent to the druid makes a physical attack against you, the attacking creature takes 1d4 piercing damage \plus1d per two nature power.
            % A creature can only be dealt damage by this effect once per round.

            % Is this how poison actually works?

            % \subcf{11th -- Elemental Retribution}
            % Whenever a creature within \rngmed range of you attacks you, the attacking creature takes 1d6 damage per two nature power of either cold, electricity, or fire damage.
            % You may choose the damage type independently for each attacking creature.

            \subcf{11th -- Grow}
            You increase in size by one size category (see \pcref{Size in Combat}).
            This is a \glossterm{Sizing} effect.
            \subcf{11th -- Natural Grab}
            If you hit with a natural attack, you may attempt to grapple your foe as an immediate action.
            \subcf{11th -- Natural Trip}
            If you hit with a natural attack, you may attempt to trip your foe as an immediate action.
            \subcf{11th -- Wolfpack}
            Overwhelmed foes you threaten increase their \glossterm{overwhelm penalties} by 1.
            \subcf{11th -- Venom}
            If you hit with a natural attack, you may inject poison into your foe as an immediate action.
            This is a \glossterm{condition}, and lasts until removed.
            At the end of each round, you make a \textit{nature power} vs. Fortitude attack against all creatures you have poisoned.
            The effects of the poison are described below.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item First success: the target is \sickened until the effect ends.
                \item Second success: the target is \staggered until the end of the next round.
                \item Third success: the target is \nauseated until the effect ends.
                \item Third failure: the target is no longer poisoned, and any lingering effects from the poison end.
            \end{itemize}
            % TODO poison stacking rules
            \par In addition, you gains a bite attack that deals 1d8 damage for a Medium druid.

            \subcf{15th -- Earth Glide}
            You gain the earth glide ability, as an earth elemental.
            This allows you to glide through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth as if it were air.
            You can walk or climb at any angle in the earth.
            However, you cannot breathe, speak, or hear while gliding in this way.
            While gliding, you can remain partially within the earth, granting you cover.
            \subcf{15th -- Natural Renewal}
            At the end of each round, you heal hit points equal to your \textit{nature power}.
            \subcf{15th -- Wings}
            You grow wings, granting you a \glossterm{fly speed} equal to your land speed.
            While \unencumbered, you can fly (see \pcref{Flying}).
            % TODO: standard flight limitation

            \subcf{19th -- Solar Radiance}
            The druid continuously radiates bright light out to a 500 foot radius (and shadowy illumination for an additional 500 feet).
            The illumination is so bright that you become hard to look at.
            Any creature attacking your from within the radius of bright light becomes \partiallyblinded for 2 rounds after the attack.

            \cf{Drd}[5]{Natural Lore}
            You gain two extra skill points which must be spent on the Creature Handling, Heal, Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (nature), Ride, or Survival skills.

            \cf{Drd}[9]{Spell Knowledge}
            You learn an additional spell from the nature \glossterm{spell list} (see \pcref{Nature Spells}).

            \cf{Drd}[13]{Natural Lore}
            You gain two extra skill points which must be spent on the Creature Handling, Heal, Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (nature), Ride, or Survival skills.

            \cf{Drd}[17]{Nature's Champion}
            You gain a \plus2 bonus to the Creature Handling, Heal, Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (nature), Ride, and Survival skills.

            \cf{Drd}[20]{Avatar of Nature}[Magical]
            If you die, except if by old age, you may choose to have your body and soul become an instrument of nature's will.
            Your body immediately decomposes or otherwise disappears, and your soul does not travel to an afterlife.
            You has no physical form, and cannot use any of your normal abilities.
            Instead, you have a fly speed of 100 feet, with special maneuverability.
            As a standard action, you can temporarily possess any living plants or animals within a 10 mile radius of the place of your death.

            While possessing a living plant or animal, you can see through its senses and control its actions completely.
            In addition, you may cast spells, and the spells take effect as if the plant or animal had cast them.
            You use the plant or animal's position to determine range, visible targets, and so on.
            You do not require verbal or somatic components to cast your spells in this form, but are unable to cast spells or perform rituals that require material components or focus objects.

            While not possessing a plant or animal, you can rest, or you can focus on reincarnating your physical form.
            Creating a new body in this way takes 12 consecutive hours of concentration.
            At the end of that time, you are reincarnated in a new body in your location, as the effect of the \spell{reincarnate} ritual, except that you can choose your race from among the races listed (not including the ``Other'' race).

            While you are an avatar of nature, you do not age and you cannot die of old age.
            You can continue to exist in this form indefinitely.

        \subsubsection{Nature Spell Mastery}
            You must have the ability to cast nature spells to gain these abilities.

            \cf{Drd}[2]{Spell Point}
            You gain a spell point.
            A spell point can be spent to cast spells in place of an action point.
            You recover all spent spell points after a \glossterm{short rest}.

            \cf{Drd}[3]{Spell Knowledge} 
            You learn an additional spell from the nature \glossterm{spell list} (see \pcref{Nature Spells}).

            \cf{Drd}[4]{Custom Augments}
            Choose a \glossterm{custom augment} for a nature spell you know.
            You can apply that augment to that spell (see \pcref{Augments}).
            At 6th level, and every two levels thereafter, you learn an additional custom augment for a nature spell you know.

    % \subcf{15th -- Air Mantle}
    % You are surrounded by a mantle of air.
    % Thrown and projectile weapons have a 50\% chance to miss your while this effect is active.
    % Unusually large weapons, such as a giant's boulders, may suffer a decreased miss chance as appropriate to their size.
    % \subcf{15th -- Aqueous Step}
    % Wherever the druid moves, you leave a path of animated water that can grab creatures.
    % Whenever a creature crosses the path, the druid makes a Reflex attack to trip the creature, causing it to fall prone and waste the rest of its movement.
    % Your accuracy is equal to your druid level \add your Constitution.
    % \subcf{15th -- Flaming Step}
    % Wherever the druid moves, you leave a path of burning flame behind your that lasts for 1 round.
    % Whenever a creature crosses the path, the druid makes a Reflex attack to deal damage to the creature.
    % The attack deals 1d8 points of fire damage per two druid levels.
    % Your accuracy is equal to your druid level \add your Constitution.
    % A failed attack deals half damage.
    % \subcf{15th -- Lifegiving Step}
    % Wherever the druid moves, you leave a path of small, living plants that entangle foes for 1 round.
    % Whenever a creature crosses the path, the druid makes a Reflex attack to entangle the creature, causing it to waste the rest of its movement.
    % Your accuracy is equal to your druid level \add your Constitution.
    % The plants appear on any surface, and will continue to grow if they can survive, though they may die quickly if they appear on inhospitable terrain.
    % \subcf{17th -- Flaming Soul}
    % You gain the fire subtype, making your immune to fire but giving your a 50\% vulnerability to cold damage.
    % In addition, whenever you deal fire damage to a creature, the creature is \ignited for 5 rounds.
    % \subcf{17th -- Sunblessed Rejuvenation}
    % You gain fast healing equal to your druid level as long as you remain in sunlight or touches a plant of your size or larger.
    % \subcf{17th -- Sunscour}
    % This aspect functions like the heart of the sun natural aspect, except that it also suppresses shadow effects and the visual components of illusions within the area of bright light.

    % \subcf{17th -- Water's Flow}
    % As a swift action, the druid can transform herself into a rushing flow of water with a volume roughly equal to your normal volume until the end of your turn.
    % In this form, she may move wherever water could go, but she cannot take other actions, such as jumping, attacking, or casting spells.
    % Your speed is halved when moving uphill and doubled when moving downhill.
    % She may move through squares occupied by creatures or threatened by blocking enemies without penalty.
    % She may return to your normal form as a free action.
    % \par If the water is split, she may reform from anywhere the water has reached, to as little as a single ounce of water.
    % If not even an ounce of water exists contiguously, your body reforms from the largest available parts of water, cut into pieces of appropriate size.
    % This usually causes the druid to die.

    \subsection{Ex-Druids}
        A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and magical druid class abilities.
        She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until you atone (see the \spell{atonement} ritual).

    % \subsection{Variant Druids}

    %     \subsubsection{Blighter}

    %         Blighters draw power from nature, as do other druids. However, while other druids revere nature and draw power from it gently, blighters steal power from nature forcefully. Wherever a blighter goes, destruction and death surely follows.

    %         \altcf{Blight} Instead of meditating to regain spell slots, a blighter draws power from your environment forcefully.
    %         This affects a \areahuge radius zone centered on your, and the process takes 1 minute of concentration.
    %         At the end of every round, every living thing in the area other than the blighter takes damage equal to your nature power.
    %         All inanimate plants of Huge size or smaller immediately wither and die.
    %         The earth becomes cracked and infertile, and any nutrients from the soil are destroyed.
    %         This ability has no effect on artificial environments or materials, such as metal or worked stone.
    %         At the end of the minute, the blighter regains your spent nature spell slots.

    %         A blighter can only blight your surroundings in this way once per hour.
    %         If your surroundings are already blighted or are not natural terrain, she cannot use this ability to regain your spells.
    %         Instead, she must meditate for 8 hours to slowly draw power from your surroundings, as a normal druid.

    %         \altcf{Spells} As normal, except that a blighter adds all Vivimancy arcane spells to your spell list.

    %         \altcf[2nd]{Wild Speech} As normal, except that a blighter gains a \plus5 bonus to Intimidate against your wild speech targets, and a \minus5 penalty to Persuasion.

    %         \altcf[10th]{Blightcasting}

    %         \altcf[20th]{Improved Blightcasting}

        % \subsubsection{Rotbringer}

        %     While most druids seek to emulate and interact with animals, rotbringers focus on the power of fungi, decay, and regeneration.

        %     \altcf{Invoke Rot} Instead of meditating to regain spell slots, a rotbringer accelerates the natural forces of decomposition and decay on your environment.
        %     This affects a \areahuge radius zone centered on your, and the process takes 1 minute of concentration.
        %     All organic objects of Huge size or smaller, such as plants and corpses, decompose.
        %     This decomposition kills inanimate, living plants.
        %     All organic objects, regardless of size, are covered with various fungi.
        %     This ability has no effect on artificial environments or materials, such as metal or worked stone.
        %     At the end of the minute, the rotbringer regains your spent nature spell slots.

        %     If the rotbringer decomposes a Huge object with this ability, or a combination of smaller objects equivalent in size to a Huge object, you gain an bonus nature spell slot of your highest available spell level.
        %     This extra spell slot lasts until it is used, or until you regain your spell slots again.

        %     A rotbringer can only invoke rot on your surroundings in this way once per hour.
        %     If your surroundings are already decomposed or are not natural terrain, she cannot use this ability to regain your spells.
        %     Instead, she must meditate for 8 hours to slowly draw power from your surroundings, as a normal druid.

        %     \altcf[2nd]{Wild Speech} The rotbringer gains the ability to speak with plants at 2nd level.
        %     You gain the ability to speak with animals at 6th level, instead of at 2nd level.

        %     \altcf[3rd]{Wild Aspect} The rotbringer does not gain this ability.

        %     \altcf[3rd]{Rot Spell} The druid learns an additional spell slot and spell known.
        %     The spell must be taken from the following list of spells.
        %     The spell's level cannot exceed half your druid level.
        %     If she already knows a spell from the list at every spell level you ha access to, she may instead learn any nature spell (see \pcref{Nature Spells}).

        %     At 5th level, and every odd level, the druid may learn a new spell.

        %     \altcf[7th]{Fungal Armor} The rotbringer becomes covered in fungus that protects your from attacks. You gain a \plus1 bonus to Armor and Fortitude defense.

    \subsection{Base Class Abilities}
        If you choose mage as a base class, you gain the following abilities.

        \classbasics{Skill Points} 4.

        \classbasics{Defenses} \plus4 Mental.

        \classbasics{Action Points} \plus3.

        \cf{Mge}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
        Mages are proficient with simple weapons and one other weapon group.
        They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield.
        Armor of any type interferes with a mage's arcane gestures, which can cause your spells with somatic components to fail.

        \cf{Mge}{Spell Point}
        The mage gains a spell point.
        A spell point can be spent to cast spells in place of an action point.
        She recovers all spent spell points after a \glossterm{short rest}.

    \subsection{Class Abilities}
        If you are a fighter, you have the following abilities.

        \cf{Mge}{Arcane Essence}
        All mages have access to great arcane power.
        However, not all mages acquired this power in the same way.
        You choose an arcane essence.
        Many mage abilities have special effects based on whether you are a sorcerer or a mage.
        \parhead{Sorcerer} Sorcerers have an intuitive connection to magic that allows them to cast spells without preparation or training.
        \parhead{Wizard} Wizards studied arcane mysteries for years to learn the secret ways of magic.
        A wizard casts spells with your Intelligence.


        \subsubsection{Spellcasting}

            \cf{Mge}{Arcane Spells} 
            You can cast arcane spells.
            You learn two arcane spells from the arcane \glossterm{spell list} (see \pcref{Arcane Spells}).
            \subparhead{Sorcerer} Your spellpower with arcane spells is equal to your character level or your Willpower, whichever is higher.
            The maximum spell level you can cast is equal to half your mage level (minimum 1).
            \subparhead{Wizard} Your spellpower with arcane spells is equal to your character level or your Intelligence, whichever is higher.
            The maximum spell level you can cast is equal to half your mage level (minimum 1) or your Intelligence, whichever is lower.

            To cast a spell, you must normally spend an \glossterm{action point}.
            Every spell can also be cast as a cantrip.
            Cantrips are weaker, but do not require action points to cast.

            \cf{Mge}{Rituals}
            \subparhead{Sorcerer} You cannot perform arcane rituals.
            \subparhead{Wizard} You can perform arcane rituals to create unique magical effects (see \pcref{Rituals}).
            You have a ritual book containing two arcane rituals of your choice (see \pcref{Arcane Rituals}).

            \cf{Mge}[6]{Standard Augment}
            Choose one of the \glossterm{standard augments} (see \pcref{Standard Augments}).
            You can apply that augment to arcane spells you cast.

            \cf{Mge}[10]{Standard Augment}
            Choose one of the \glossterm{standard augments} (see \pcref{Standard Augments}).
            You can apply that augment to arcane spells you cast.

            \cf{Mge}[14]{Standard Augment}
            Choose one of the \glossterm{standard augments} (see \pcref{Standard Augments}).
            You can apply that augment to arcane spells you cast.

            \cf{Mge}[18]{Spell Point}
            You gain a spell point.
            A spell point can be spent to cast spells in place of an action point.
            You recover all spent spell points after a \glossterm{short rest}.

        \subsubsection{Arcane Lore}
            You must have the ability to cast arcane spells to gain these abilities.

            \cf{Mge}[2]{Spell Knowledge} 
            You learn an additional spell from the arcane \glossterm{spell list} (see \pcref{Arcane Spells}).

            \cf{Mge}[3]{Arcane Insight} 
            You gain a greater understanding of magic.
            You choose one of the following insights.
            Each insight can be chosen multiple times.
            At 7th level, and every four levels thereafter, you gain an additional arcane insight.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Innate Spell: Choose a spell you know.
                    You no longer need verbal or somatic components to cast that spell.
                    \par If you choose this insight multiple times, she must choose a different spell each time.
                \item Personal Spell: Choose a spell you know.
                    You cannot miscast that spell (see \pcref{Miscasting}).
                    If you would miscast it, the spell simply fails without effect.
                    In addition, you automatically succeeds at all Concentration checks you make to cast the spell.
                    \par If you choose this insight multiple times, you must choose a different spell each time.
                \item Specialization: Choose a school of magic.
                    You learn an additional spell from that school of magic.
                    In exchange, you must ban two other schools of magic.
                    You can never learn or cast spells or rituals from your banned schools.
                    If you know spells from a banned school, you must immediately learn different spells from unbanned schools in their place.
                    \par If you choose this insight multiple times, you must choose to specialize in the same school each time.
            \end{itemize}

            \subparhead{Sorcerer} You may also choose the Expanded Spell Knowledge insight.
            You choose a single spell from the divine spell list or nature spell list and add it to your arcane spell list.
            This does not grant you the spell as a spell known, but you may exchange one of your spells known to learn that new spell.
            \par If you choose this insight multiple times, you must choose a different spell each time.

            \subparhead{Wizard} You may also choose the Ritual Spell insight.
            You scribe an arcane spell you know into your ritual book.
            The spell is treated as a ritual, and you can perform a one minute ritual to gain the spell's effect.
            Performing the ritual costs the normal amount of material components for a ritual of its level (see \pcref{Ritual Costs}).
            You can apply standard augments or custom augments to the spell normally, increasing the ritual's level and material component cost appropriately.

            \cf{Mge}[5]{Lesser Essence Lore}[Magical]
            You gain an ability based on your choice of arcane essence.
            \subparhead{Sorcerer} You gain bonus hit points equal to your spellpower with arcane spells.
            \subparhead{Wizard} You gains a \plus2 bonus to all Knowledge skills.

            \cf{Mge}[9]{Spell Knowledge}
            You learn an additional spell from the arcane \glossterm{spell list} (see \pcref{Arcane Spells}).

            \cf{Mge}[13]{Essence Lore}[Magical]
            You gain an ability based on your choice of arcane essence.
            \subparhead{Sorcerer} You gain \glossterm{magic resistance} equal to 5 \add your spellpower with arcane spells.
            \subparhead{Wizard} You learn the Contingency augment, allowing you to prepare a spell so it takes effect automatically if specific circumstances arise.
            The Contingency augment adds two levels to a spell's level.
            You can apply this augment to any arcane spell with a casting time of a single standard action.

            Casting a spell with the Contingency augment takes 5 minutes.
            When the casting is complete, the spell has no immediate effect.
            Instead, it automatically takes effect when some specific circumstances arise.
            During this casting time, you specify what circumstances cause the spell to take effect.

            The spell can be set to trigger in response to any circumstances that a typical human observing you and your situation could detect.
            For example, you could specify ``when I fall at least 50 feet'' or ``when I become bloodied'', but not ``when there is an invisible creature within 50 feet of me'' or ``when I am at 17 hit points or fewer.''
            The more specific the required circumstances, the better -- vague requirements, such as ``when I am in danger'', may cause the spell to trigger unexpectedly or fail to trigger at all.
            If you attempt to specify multiple separate triggering conditions, such as ``when I take damage or when an enemy is adjacent to me'', the spell will randomly ignore all but one of the conditions.

            If the spell needs to be targeted, the trigger condition can specify a simple rule for identifying how to target the spell, such as ``the closest enemy''.
            If the rule is poorly worded or imprecise, the spell may target incorrectly or fail to activate at all.
            Any spells which require decisions, such as the \spell{dimension door} spell, must have those decisions made at the time it is cast.
            You cannot alter those decisions when the contingency takes effect.

            You can have only one spell with this augment active at a time.
            If you use the augment again with a different spell, the new spell.

            \cf{Mge}[17th]{Greater Essence Lore}[Magical]
            You gain an ability based on your choice of arcane essence.

            \subparhead{Sorcerer} Whenever you resist a spell with your \glossterm{magic resistance}, you gain the ability to cast that spell once.
            The spell retains all augments, effects from feats and other abilities, and similar modifications from the original caster, and you cannot choose any other augments or apply effects from your own abilities.
            However, you make all other decisions required to cast the spell, and uses your spellpower to determine the spell's effects.
            Once you cast the spell, you expend the absorbed energy, and you cannot cast it again.

            If you resist multiple spells simultaneously, or if you resist another spell with your magic resistance before casting the previous spell you resisted, you choose which spell you gain the ability to cast.

            \subparhead{Wizard} You may have two spells active with the Contingency augment, rather than only one.
            Whenever you cast a new spell with the Contingency augment, you choose which existing contingency to replace.

            Only one contingency can trigger in a given round.
            If both would trigger simultaneously, only the first spell cast triggers.
            The second spell cast does not trigger that round.

            \cf{Mge}[20th]{Archmage}
            You no longer need to spend action points to cast spells.
            If you have any spell points, you lose those spell points and gain the same number of legend points instead.

        \subsubsection{Arcane Spell Mastery}
            You must have the ability to cast arcane spells to gain these abilities.

            \cf{Mge}[2]{Spell Point}
            You gain a spell point.
            A spell point can be spent to cast spells in place of an action point.
            You recover all spent spell points after a \glossterm{short rest}.

            \cf{Mge}[3]{Spell Knowledge} 
            You learn an additional spell from the arcane \glossterm{spell list} (see \pcref{Arcane Spells}).

            \cf{Mge}[4]{Custom Augments}
            Choose a \glossterm{custom augment} for a arcane spell you know.
            You can apply that augment to that spell (see \pcref{Augments}).
            At 6th level, and every two levels thereafter, you learn an additional custom augment for a arcane spell you know.

        \classbasics{Action Points} \plus3.

        \cf{Mnk}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
        Monks are proficient with simple weapons, monk weapons, and any one other weapon group.
        Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields.
        When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses the benefit of your enlightened defense, fast movement, and \ki abilities.

        \cf{Mnk}{Ki Strike}[Mag] A monk's fists, and all weapons you use, gain a \plus1 \glossterm{enhancement bonus}.
        This functions like an enhancement bonus on a weapon, increasing your damage and offensive legend points per day (see \pcref{Weapon Enhancement Bonuses}).
        In addition, you are always treated as if you wa wearing \plus1 armor, granting your temporary hit points and defensive legend points (see \pcref{Armor Enhancement Bonuses}).
        This bonus increases by \plus1 at 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter.

    \subsection{Class Abilities}
        All monks have the following abilities.

        \cf{Mnk}{Enlightened Defense}[Mag]
        A monk's \ki shields your body from attacks.
        When \monkunencumbered, you gain a \plus2 bonus to Armor defense.
        She loses this bonus when you are helpless.

        \cf{Mnk}{Ki Power}
        Many monk abilities depend on your \ki power.
        A monk's \ki power is equal to your Willpower or your character level, whichever is higher.

        \cf{Mnk}{Unarmed Warrior}
        A monk's unarmed attacks are exceptionally deadly.
        You gain Unarmed Fighting as a bonus feat, making your proficient with your unarmed attack (see \featpcref{Unarmed Fighting}).
        In addition, you increase the damage of your unarmed attacks by two increments (see \pcref{Weapon Size}).
        For example, a Medium monk would deal 1d6 damage with your unarmed attack.
        For details about how to fight while unarmed, see \pcref{Unarmed Combat}.

        \cf{Mnk}[2nd]{Manifest Ki}[Mag]
        The monk gains the ability to channel your \ki energy to temporarily enhance your abilities.
        She chooses one \ki manifestation from the list below.

        Using a \ki manifestation costs a \ki point.
        The monk has a number of \ki points equal to your Willpower or your monk level, whichever is higher.
        \Ki points can be recovered by meditation.
        If the monk meditates for 1 hour, you recover all spent \ki points.

        Some \ki manifestations have minimum monk levels, as indicated in the title of the power.
        At your 4th monk level, and every even monk level thereafter, the monk learns an additional \ki manifestation.

        Some \ki manifestations have the effects of spells.
        Unless otherwise noted, the monk's effective spellpower with these abilities is equal to your \ki power.

        \subcf{Elegant Whirl of Fluid Motion}

        \subcf{6th -- Surpass the Mortal Limits}
        As a swift action, the monk can surpass the physical limitations of your body.
        Until the end of the round, she may use your \ki power in place of your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution when making checks.
        \subcf{8th -- Flash Step}
        As a swift action during the movement phase, the monk can teleport to anywhere she can see within 30 feet.
        If your line of effect is blocked, even by an invisible barrier, or if this would somehow place your inside a solid object, the ability fails.
        \subcf{8th -- Focus the Wayward Mind}
        As a swift action, the monk can dispel all \glossterm{Mind} effects that are affecting your.

        She can ``see'' any living creatures and their equipment within 50 feet perfectly, regardless of lighting conditions, invisibility, or any other means of concealment.
        This cannot detect living creatures through solid walls, however.
        \subcf{10th -- Dance of the Foolish Blow}
        This \ki manifestation functions as the \textit{dance of the wayward strike} manifestation, except that it can affect any melee attack, not just a single strike.
        The monk must have the \textit{dance of the wayward strike} \ki manifestation to learn this manifestation.
        \subcf{12th -- Diamond Fists}
        As a swift action, the monk can empower your unarmed attacks with incredible force.
        Until the end of the round, she may use your \ki power in place of your normal modifiers to physical damage with your unarmed attacks.
        In addition, you treat your unarmed strike as if it were an adamantine weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and hardness.
        \subcf{12th -- Stunning Fist}
        As an immediate action, when the monk deals damage with an unarmed melee strike, she can make a \Ki power vs. Fortitude attack against the struck creature.
        Success means the target is \staggered for 2 rounds.
        Critical success means the target is \stunned for 2 rounds.
        \norepeatnotes
        \subcf{14th -- Awaken the Pacifist Heart}
        As an immediate action, when the monk hits with a melee strike, she can make a \Ki power vs. Mental attack against the struck creature.
        Success means the target is unable to take violent actions, such as attacking, for 2 rounds.

        \subcf{16th -- Flash Burst}
        As a swift action during the movement phase, the monk can teleport to anywhere within 1,000 feet.
        She must clearly visualize the destination, but you doe not need line of sight or line of effect.

        \subcf{20th -- Ki-Shattering Strike}
        As an immediate action, when the monk hits with a melee strike, she can disrupt your foe's \ki.
        The target is \severelyimpaired with attacks and checks for 2 rounds.

        \cf{Mnk}[3rd]{Wholeness of Body}[Mag]
        With concentration and focus, the monk can correct the flow of energy within your body.
        She can use this ability as a standard action by spending a \ki point, or with one minute of meditation otherwise.
        If you doe, you heal 1d6 hit points per \ki power.

        \cf{Mnk}[3rd]{Uncanny Dodge}
        The monk can react to danger before your senses would normally allow your to do so.
        The monk reduces your overwhelm penalties by 1.
        If your overwhelm penalty is reduced to 0, you are not considered to be overwhelmed.
        In addition, you are not \unaware when attacked by surprise.

        \cf{Mnk}[5th]{Flurry of Blows}\label{Flurry of Blows}
        As a standard action, the monk can spend a \ki point to unleash a furious barrage of blows.
        She can make a \glossterm{standard attack} with an extra \glossterm{strike}.
        Alternately, she can choose to make one \glossterm{strike} against all foes you threaten.

        \cf{Mnk}[7th]{Perfect Motion}[Mag]
        The monk becomes immune to effects that restrict your mobility.
        She suffers no penalties for acting underwater.
        In addition, you gain a \plus20 bonus to Reflex defense against grapple attacks, as well as on grapple attacks or Escape Artist checks made to escape a grapple or a pin.

        \cf{Mnk}[9th]{Improved Uncanny Dodge}
        The monk reduces your overwhelm penalties by 2.
        This does not stack with the effects of uncanny dodge.

        \cf{Mnk}[9th]{Perfect Soul}[Mag]
        The monk gains \glossterm{magic resistance} equal to 10 \add your \ki power.

        \cf{Mnk}[15th]{Perfect Body}[Mag]
        The monk becomes immune to being blinded, deafened, fatigued, exhausted, nauseated, sickened, and staggered.

        The monk still dies of old age when your time is up.

        \cf{Mnk}[17th]{Perfect Life}[Mag]
        At the end of each round, the monk heals hit points equal to twice your \ki power.
        This replaces the benefit from your flow of life ability.
        If you ha taken vital damage, she instead heals vital damage equal to half your \ki power.
        In addition, you become immune to \glossterm{Death} effects.

        \cf{Mnk}[19th]{True Perfection}[Mag]
        The monk becomes inhumanly perfect.
        If you roll less than a 5 on any d20 roll, it is treated as a 5.

        \cf{Mnk}[20th]{Transcend Mortality}[Mag]
        If the monk dies, she may choose to retain control of your body and soul through sheer force of will.
        Your body immediately disappears, and your soul does not travel to an afterlife.
        Instead, your body reforms with no trace of its injuries 24 hours later.
        The reformed body is in perfect health and can be any age the monk chooses, to a minimum of the age of adulthood for your race.
        She can reform your body at the place where she died, or in any place on the same plane that is deeply familiar to your.

        After each time the monk reforms herself this way, it takes 24 additional hours to reform the next time she ``dies''.
        A monk with this ability can only be permanently killed by the direct intervention of a deity.

        \subsubsection{Ex-Monks}
            A monk who becomes chaotic loses your \ki powers, and cannot gain more levels as a monk.
            She retains all your other class abilities.
            If you stop being chaotic, you regain your \ki powers and ability to take monk levels.

        \cf{Pal}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
        Paladins are proficient with simple weapons, any three other weapon groups, all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and shields.

        \cf{Pal}{Divine Protection}[Mag]
        The paladin's force of belief manifests a divine protection around your.
        She may add your Willpower to your Armor defense in place of Dexterity or Constitution (see \pcref{Defenses}).

    \subsection{Class Abilities}
        All paladins have the following abilities.

        \cf{Pal}{Devoted Alignment}
        A paladin is devoted to a specific alignment.
        She must choose one of your alignment components: good, evil, lawful, or chaotic.
        The alignment you choose is your devoted alignment.
        A paladin's class abilities are affected by this choice.
        She excels at slaying creatures with alignments opposed to your devoted alignment.
        A paladin's devoted alignment cannot be changed without extraordinary repurcussions to the paladin.

        \cf{Pal}{Divine Power}
        Many paladin abilities depend on your divine power.
        A paladin's divine power is equal to your Willpower or your character level, whichever is higher.

        \cf{Pal}{Divine Invocation}[Mag]
        A paladin can invoke the power of your alignment to achieve incredible effects.
        This ability can be used a number of times per day equal to your Willpower or your paladin level, whichever is higher.
        You gain the smite divine invocation.

        At 2nd level, and every even level thereafter, the paladin gains an additional divine invocation.
        Most divine invocations have minimum paladin levels, as indicated in the title of the ability.
        Some divine invocations are also restricted to paladins with specific devoted alignments.
        The paladin's accuracy with divine invocations is equal to your divine power.
        If a divine invocation emulates a spell, the paladin's effective spellpower is equal to your divine power.

        Divine powers marked with an asterisk are called smite powers.
        Smite powers function like the smite divine invocation, except that they also have additional effects.
        Unless otherwise noted, these additional effects only occur if the smited creature does not share the paladin's devoted alignment.

        \parhead{Any Alignment}

        \subcf{Smite}
        Once per round, when the paladin makes a strike, she may declare that strike to be a smite.
        She may use your divine power in place of your normal accuracy for that strike.
        If the struck creatture shares your devoted alignment, you deal no damage at all (not even normal weapon damage), but the use of the ability is still spent.
        Otherwise, your weapon deals maximum damage, and you deal bonus damage equal to your divine power.
        \subcf{2nd -- Bless} This invocation functions like the \spell{bless} spell.
        \subcf{2nd -- Lay on Hands}
        As a standard action, the paladin can lay hands on a creature.
        The target is healed for 1d6 damage per divine power.
        \subcf{2nd -- Protection from Alignment} This invocation functions like the \spell{protection from alignment} spell.
        The paladin must protect the target from the alignment opposed to your devoted alignment.
        \subcf{6th -- Exhausting Smite*}
        The paladin makes a Divine power vs. Fortitude attack against the struck creature.
        Success means it is \exhausted for 2 rounds.
        \subcf{6th -- Resounding Smite*}
        The struck creature is knocked prone.
        \subcf{6th -- Seeking Smite*}
        This smite attack ignores any miss chances, such as from active cover or visual impairment.
        The weapon must still be physically able to strike the target.
        \subcf{6th -- Goading Smite*}
        The struck creature is \goaded by the paladin for 2 rounds.
        \subcf{10th -- Dispelling Smite*}
        The struck creature is affected by \spell{dispel magic}.
        \subcf{10th -- Divine Might}
        This invocation functions like the \spell{divine might} spell.
        \subcf{10th -- Penetrating Smite*}
        The struck creature's armor is weakened.
        For the next 2 rounds, attacks against the target that would normally target Armor defense are instead made against the lower of the target's Armor and Reflex defenses.
        \subcf{14th -- Dazing Smite*}
        The struck creature is \dazed for 2 rounds.
        \subcf{14th -- Spellreaving Smite*}
        All spells and magical effects on the struck creature are dispelled.
        Spells and effects that cannot be removed by \spell{dispel magic} are unaffected.
        The paladin must have the dispelling smite invocation to choose this invocation.
        \subcf{14th -- Terrifying Smite*}
        The paladin makes a Divine power vs. Mental attack against the struck creature.
        Success means it is \frightened by your for 2 rounds.
        \subcf{18th -- Converting Smite*}
        The paladin's smite shows your foe the error of its ways.
        She makes a Divine power vs. Mental attack against the struck creature.
        Success means it is \confused for 2 rounds.
        Critical success means its alignment changes, and it gains the paladin's devoted alignment for 1 week.
        After that time, it can choose to return to its original alignment, or keep its new alignment permanently.
        Failure means it is \dazed for 2 rounds.
        \subcf{18th -- Immobilizing Smite*}
        The creature struck with this smite is \immobilized for 5 rounds.

        \parhead{Chaos Divine Invocations}
        \subcf{6th -- Confusion} This invocation functions like the \spell{confusion} spell, except that it affects targets within \rngmed range.
        \subcf{6th -- Freedom} This invocation functions like the \spell{freedom} spell.
        \subcf{10th -- Break the Chains}
        As a standard action, the paladin can break all shackles, bindings, and locks within a \arealarge radius burst of your.
        Nonmagical objects are automatically broken.
        To break magical objects, the paladin must make an attack with your divine power against a DR equal to 10 \add the object's spellpower.
        \subcf{10th -- Chaotic Redirection}
        As an immediate action, when the paladin or any of your allies within \rngclose range is struck by a physical attack, the paladin can redirect the attack to a random creature within \rngclose range of the paladin, including the paladin.
        The attack is made against that creature instead of its original target, using its original accuracy, and has its normal effects if it hits.
        After using this invocation, the paladin cannot use it for 5 rounds.
        \subcf{14th -- Discordant Song} This invocation functions like the \spell{discordant song} spell.

        \parhead{Good Divine Invocations}
        \subcf{Shield Other}
        This invocation functions like the \spell{share pain} spell.
        \subcf{6th -- Martyr's Shield}
        As an immediate action, when an ally within \rngmed range would take vital damage, the paladin can take that damage as regular damage instead.

        \parhead{Evil Divine Invocations}

        \subcf{10th -- Executing Smite*}

        \parhead{Law Divine Invocations}
        \subcf{2nd -- Command} This invocation functions like the \spell{command} spell.

        \cf{Pal}[3rd]{Discernment}[Mag]
        A paladin can discern truths about creatures you see as a swift action.
        When you use this ability, you learn which creatures within a \arealarge cone have your devoted alignment.

        The paladin may use your discernment ability a number of times per day equal to your Perception or half your paladin level (minimum 1), whichever is higher.

        At 7th level, the paladin can discern lies.
        Whenever a creature in the area intentionally lies, the paladin knows the statement was a lie.
        This does not reveal the truth, uncover unintentional inaccuracies, or necessarily reveal evasions.

        At 11th level, the paladin can also see invisible creatures and objects within the area as if they were normally visible.
        They are visible as translucent shapes, allowing you to easily distinguish between visible and invisible creatures and objects.

        At 15th level, the paladin can discern truth.
        When a lie is spoken, in addition to learning that the statement is a lie, the paladin learns what the creature believes the truth to be.
        This does not necessarily reveal the actual truth -- merely what the creature believes.

        At 19th level, the paladin can discern thoughts.
        She knows the surface thoughts of all creatures in the area.
        You gain a \plus4 bonus to Bluff, Persuasion, and Intimidate attacks and checks against a creature whose thoughts she can read.

        \cf{Pal}[4th]{Divine Presence}[Mag]
        The paladin's presence alters the world around your.
        She chooses a single divine presence from the list below.
        Each divine presence affects a \areamed radius emanation from the paladin, including herself.
        She may choose to suppress or resume your divine presence as a swift action.

        At your 8th paladin level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the paladin gains an additional divine presence.
        She may have multiple divine presences active simultaneously, and suppress or resume them individually.
        Most divine presences have minimum paladin levels, as indicated in the title of the ability.
        If a divine presence emulates a spell, the paladin's effective spellpower is equal to your paladin level or your Willpower, whichever is higher.

        \parhead{Any Alignment}
        \subcf{8th -- Worthy Foe}
        Enemies in the area are \goaded by the paladin.
        \subcf{16th -- Aura of Unbending Purpose}

        \subcf{Overwhelming Aura}
        Enemies in the area that are \glossterm{overwhelmed} increase their overwhelm penalties by 1.
        \subcf{8th -- Lifefeeding Aura}
        At the end of each round, if another creature in the area took damage, the paladin regains hit points equal to the damage taken, up to a maximum of your divine power.

        Enemies in the area are \impaired with attacks and checks.
        \subcf{12th -- Painful Aura}
        Whenever an enemy in the area takes damage, the damage is doubled, up to a maximum bonus equal to the paladin's divine power.
        Each enemy can only take this bonus damage each round.
        \subcf{16th -- Sacrificial Aura}
        Whenever you take damage, any other creature in the area may choose to take that damage instead.
        This damage ignores all forms of damage reduction and similar abilities.
        Any damage in excess of the creature's hit points is not redirected.

        \parhead{Good Divine Presences}
        \subcf{Defensive Aura}
        Allies in the area that are \glossterm{overwhelmed} reduce their overwhelm penalties by 1.
        If an ally's overwhelm penalty is reduced to 0, they are not considered to be overwhelmed.
        \subcf{8th -- Minor Healing Aura}
        Whenever an ally in the area regains hit points, the healing is doubled, up to a maximum bonus equal to the paladin's divine power.
        Each ally can only receive this bonus once per round.
        \subcf{12th -- Healing Aura}
        At the end of each round, allies in the area heal hit points equal to the paladin's divine power.
        \subcf{16th -- Martyr's Aura}
        Whenever an ally in the area takes damage, the paladin may choose to take that damage instead.
        This damage ignores all forms of damage reduction and similar abilities.
        If the paladin takes damage in excess of your hit points in this way, the excess damage is dealt directly as vital damage.

        \parhead{Lawful Divine Presences}
        \subcf{Aura of Fortification}
        Enemies in the area move at half speed through threatened squares.
        \subcf{8th -- Aura of Inhibition}

        \subcf{20th -- Inescapable Aura}
        At the start of each round, enemies in the area are \immobilized that round.

        \cf{Pal}[5th]{Pass Judgment}[Mag]
        The paladin gains the ability to pass judgment on those you deem unworthy.
        Once per day as a swift action, she may pass judgment on a creature within 100 feet of your.
        For the purpose of spells and effects, the creature is treated as if it had the alignment opposed to the paladin's devoted alignment.
        This effect lasts for one week, or until the paladin changes your mind about the subject.
        This does not change the creature's actions or behavior, but the creature is subject to the paladin's smite attack, would detect as that alignment under the inspection of a \spell{detect alignment} spell, and so on.

        No attack is required for this effect, and it cannot be dispelled, but a \spell{remove curse}, \spell{miracle}, or \spell{wish} spell can remove it.
        The paladin can use this ability an additional time per day at your 9th paladin level and every four levels thereafter.
        A paladin should be careful when using this ability, as persecution of allies can lead overzealous paladins to fall.

        \cf{Pal}[9th]{Expanded Presence}[Mag]
        The paladin's divine presences affect an \arealarge radius.

        \cf{Pal}[13th]{Lingering Presence}[Mag]
        The effects of the paladin's divine presences continue for 1 round after targets leave the area.

        \cf{Pal}[15th]{Martyr's Retribution}[Mag]
        If the paladin dies in the devoted service of your devoted alignment, she may choose to have your fallen body erupt in an immense burst of divine energy.
        If you doe, your body is almost completely consumed, preventing your from being raised with \ritual{resurrection} and similar effects that require an intact body.
        This burst has two effects.
        First, a \spell{sunburst} spell immediately takes effect over the area where the paladin fell.
        Second, a \spell{storm of vengeance} spell begins to take effect, centered on the same area.
        The spell lasts for 10 rounds, and the lightning strikes target the paladin's enemies.
        Both of these effects harm only the paladin's foes, and do not harm your allies.
        However, your allies' vision is still impeded by the \spell{storm of vengeance}.

        \cf{Pal}[17th]{Mighty Presence}[Mag]
        The paladin's divine presences affect an \areahuge radius.
        In addition, their effects continue for 2 rounds after targets leave the area.

        \cf{Pal}[20th]{Aligned Soul}[Mag]
        While a paladin is dead, she may approach the deity or governing figure of your afterlife and request to be returned to life to continue your mission.
        Travelling to the relevant figure and making the request takes 12 hours.
        Unless there are extenuating circumstances, this request is almost always granted, and you are resurrected in a new body at a location of the entity's choice.
        This functions like the \spell{resurrection} ritual, except that no part of the body is required, and a new body is created by the entity.
        She can be resurrected in this way regardless of the condition of your body, but not if your soul has been trapped or otherwise prevented from going to the correct afterlife.

        \subsubsection{Ex-Paladins}
            A paladin who ceases to follow your devoted alignment loses all magical paladin class abilities.
            She may not gain any additional paladin levels.
            She regains your abilities and advancement potential if you atone for your violations (see the \spell{atonement} ritual), as appropriate.

        You are also proficient with your choice of bows, crossbows, or thrown weapons.

        \cf{Rgr}{Tenacious Hunter}
        The ranger adds your quarry bonus to your defenses against attacks that your quarry makes.
        See the Quarry ability, below, for details.

        \cf{Rgr}{Wild Speech}[Mag]
        The ranger learns how to communicate with animals.
        This ability functions like the druid ability of the same name (see Wild Speech, \pref{Drd:Wild Speech}).
        A ranger can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Perception or half your ranger level, whichever is higher.

    \subsection{Class Abilities}
        All rangers have the following abilities.

        \cf{Rgr}{Quarry}
        As a swift action, a ranger may designate any foe he sees as your quarry.
        A ranger gains a \plus2 bonus to damage with physical attacks and Awareness, Stealth, and Survival checks against your quarry.
        However, while a ranger has designated a quarry, he takes a \minus2 penalty on the same rolls against any target other than your quarry.

        A ranger may not normally have more than one quarry at once.
        He may not designate a new quarry until you defeat your old quarry, or until he gives up on the quarry.
        He may give up pursuing a quarry as a free action.
        If you do, you are unable to designate a new quarry until he rests for 5 minutes.

        Some abilities allow the ranger to designate multiple creatures as a quarry.
        Abilities which designate multiple creatures as a quarry always last for a specific amount of time.

        If the ranger does not see your quarry for more than a week, it is no longer considered your quarry.

        The amount by which a ranger's damage and skill checks increase against your quarry is called your quarry bonus.
        The ranger's quarry bonus improves by \plus1 at your 5th ranger level and every 5 ranger levels thereafter.
        Your penalties against targets other than your quarry remains the same.

        \cf{Rgr}[2nd]{Hunting Skill}
        The ranger gains any Skill feat with prerequisites that include one of the ranger class skills as a bonus feat.
        He must use your ranger level in place of your character level to meet level prerequisites for the feat.
        At your 6th ranger level, and every 4 ranger levels thereafter, you gain an additional feat.

        \cf{Rgr}[2nd]{Tracker}
        The ranger gains a \plus5 bonus to checks made to follow tracks.
        In addition, he may use your ranger level in place of the Survival skill to follow tracks (see \pcref{Survival}).

        \cf{Rgr}[4th]{Hunting Lore}
        The ranger gains an ability drawn from ancient hunting lore.
        He chooses a single hunting lore from the list below.
        Some hunting lores have minimum ranger levels, as indicated in the title of the ability.
        At your 8th ranger level, and every four ranger levels thereafter, the ranger gains an additional hunting lore.

        If a hunting lore grants the ranger a bonus feat, he must still meet any prerequisites for the feat to gain its effect.

        \subcf{Dual Quarry}
        The ranger may designate up to two targets whenever he chooses a quarry.
        You gain your quarry benefits against both targets.
        Whenever he designates new quarries, he may choose which previous quarry to give up (if any).

        \subcf{Endurance}
        The ranger gains the Endurance feat as a bonus feat (see \featpcref{Endurance}).

        \subcf{Goading Hunter}
        Whenever the ranger damages your quarry with a physical attack, it is \goaded by you for 2 rounds.

        \subcf{No Escape}
        Whenever the ranger damages your quarry with a physical attack, it moves at half speed for 2 rounds.

        \subcf{Swift Hunter}
        The ranger gains the Swift feat as a bonus feat (see \featpcref{Swift}).

        \subcf{8th -- Anchored Quarry}
        Whenever the ranger damages your quarry with a physical attack, it cannot travel extradimensionally for 2 rounds.
        This blocks teleportation and all planar travel abilities except planar rifts.

        \subcf{8th -- Flexible Quarry}
        After giving up on a quarry, the ranger does not need to wait before designating a new quarry.

        \subcf{8th -- Impaired Quarry}
        Whenever the ranger damages your quarry with a physical attack, it is \impaired with attacks and checks for 2 rounds.

        \subcf{12th -- Inescapable}
        Whenever the ranger damages your quarry with a physical attack, it moves at one-quarter speed as long as it remains your quarry.

        \subcf{12th -- Inevitable Hunter}
        The ranger ignores all miss chances and failure chances that would affect attacks and checks he makes against your quarry.

        \subcf{12th -- Punishing Presence}
        At the end of each round, if the ranger's quarry is within \rnglong range of you, it takes life damage equal to your ranger level.

        \subcf{16th -- Legendary Hunter}
        The ranger may always use legend points on attacks or checks he makes against your quarry, even when fighting monsters that normally prevent legend points from being used.

        \subcf{16th -- Master of the Hunt}
        When the ranger uses your quarry ability, he may also designate up to five willing creatures within \rnglong range of you.
        As long as they stay within \rnglong range of you, they also gain the damage bonus from the ranger's quarry ability against your quarry.
        Your allies do not suffer penalties against targets other than the quarry.

        \cf{Rgr}[3rd]{Free Stride}
        The ranger can move through any sort of natural terrain that slows or impedes movement at your normal speed without suffering any sort of impairment.
        If a skill check, such as Climb or Swim, would normally be required to move through the terrain, this ability does not help.

        \cf{Rgr}[3rd]{Keen Vision}
        The ranger's sight improves, allowing you to see more easily.
        You gain \glossterm{low-light vision}, allowing you to treat sources of light as if they had double their normal illumination range.
        If he already has low-light vision, he doubles its benefit, allowing you to treat sources of light as if they had four times their normal illumination range.
        In addition, you gain \glossterm{darkvision} out to 50 feet, allowing you to see in complete darkness.
        If he already has darkvision, he increases its range by 50 feet.

        \cf{Rgr}[5th]{Rapid Tracker}
        The ranger's ability to track your foes improves.
        He can move at your normal speed while following tracks without taking the normal \minus5 penalty.
        He takes only a \minus10 penalty (instead of the normal \minus20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.

        \cf{Rgr}[7th]{Blindsense}
        The ranger's perceptions are so finely honed that he can sense your enemies without seeing them.
        You gain the blindsense ability out to 50 feet.
        This ability allows you to sense the presence and location of objects and foes within 50 feet without seeing them.
        If he already has the blindsense ability, he increases its range by 50 feet.

        In addition, he increases the range of your darkvision by 150 feet.

        \cf{Rgr}[9th]{Perfect Stride}[Mag]
        The ranger's ability to surpass obstacles becomes unparalleled.
        He constantly acts as if he were under the effect of a \spell{freedom} spell, except that it does not allow you to act normally underwater.

        \cf{Rgr}[11th]{Blindsight}
        The ranger gains the \glossterm{blindsight} ability, allowing you to ``see'' perfectly without your eyes in a 50 foot radius around you.
        With this ability, he can fight just as well with your eyes closed as with them open.
        If he already has the blindsight ability, he increases its range by 50 feet.

        In addition, he increases the range of your darkvision by 300 feet, and your blindsense by 150 feet.

        \cf{Rgr}[13th]{Implacable Hunter}[Mag]
        The ranger cannot be blocked from pursuing your quarry.
        Your movement is not slowed by enemies threatening you (see \pcref{Moving Near Foes}).
        In addition, he may move at half speed through spaces occupied by foes.

        \cf{Rgr}[15th]{Farsight}
        The ranger increases the range of your darkvision by 500 feet, your blindsense by 300 feet, and your blindsight by 50 feet.
        In addition, you halve your \glossterm{range increment penalties} for attacking at long range.

        \cf{Rgr}[17th]{Eternal Quarry}
        The ranger's quarry never stops being your quarry until he chooses a different creature.
        In addition, once he has designated a creature as a quarry, he can always designate it as a quarry again, even if it is not in your sight.
        This only applies to creatures that he designates as a quarry after acquiring this ability.

        \cf{Rgr}[19th]{Truesight}[Mag]
        The ranger's perceptions are accurate enough to defeat even powerful magic.
        He can see through normal and magical darkness, see the truth behind visual figments and glamers, and see the true form of creatures and objects affected by \glossterm{Shaping} abilities.
        This ability works at any range.

    \subsection{Base Class Abilities}
        A character with rogue as a base class gains the following abilities.

        \classbasics{Skill Points} 15.

        \classbasics{Defenses} \plus4 Reflex, \plus2 Mental.

        \classbasics{Action Points} \plus2.

        \cf{Rog}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
        Rogues are proficient with simple weapons, any two weapon groups, light armor, and bucklers.
        They are also proficient with saps.

        \cf{Rog}{Skill Exemplar}
        A rogue gains a \plus2 bonus to all skills you are trained in.
        This bonus increases by 1 at your 5th rogue level and every 5 rogue levels thereafter.

    \subsection{Class Abilities}
        All rogues have the following abilities.

        \cf{Rog}{Sneak Attack}
        Once per round, when a rogue hits with a physical attack against a creature unable to defend itself effectively, she can make that attack a sneak attack.
        She can make a sneak attack if your target is \unaware, \defenseless, or suffering \glossterm{overwhelm penalties} from being surrounded by enemies (see \pcref{Overwhelm}).
        A sneak attack deals 1d6 points of bonus damage.

        The extra damage dealt by a sneak attack increases by 1d6 at your 3rd rogue level and every two rogue levels thereafter.

        Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.
        A rogue can't strike with deadly accuracy from beyond that range.

        A rogue can only sneak attack creatures with a discernible body structure.
        Oozes, incorporeal creatures, and some plants lack vital areas to attack.
        Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks.
        The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot.
        A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach.
        Usually, this means she can only make sneak attacks against creatures no more than two size categories larger than your.

        \cf{Rog}[2nd]{Skill Talent}
        The rogue's skills improve.
        You gain an additional skill point, which she can place in any skill, and a bonus Skill feat for which you qualifie (see \pcref{Skill Feats}).
        She must use your rogue level in place of your character level to meet level prerequisites for the feat.
        At your 6th rogue level, and every four rogue levels thereafter, you gain an additional skill point and Skill feat.

        \cf{Rog}[3rd]{Uncanny Dodge}
        The rogue can react to danger before your senses would normally allow your to do so.
        The rogue reduces your overwhelm penalties by 1.
        If your overwhelm penalty is reduced to 0, you are not considered to be overwhelmed.
        In addition, you are not \unaware when attacked by surprise.

        \cf{Rog}[4th]{Combat Tricks}
        The rogue gains a combat trick to aid your and confound your foes.
        She chooses a single combat trick from the list below.
        Some combat tricks have minimum rogue levels, as indicated in the title of the ability.
        At your 8th rogue level, and every four rogue levels thereafter, the rogue gains an additional combat trick.

        Some combat tricks depend on a rogue's trick power.
        A rogue's trick power is equal to your Intelligence or your character level, whichever is higher.

        Tricks marked with an asterisk are called ambush attacks.
        Ambush attacks only function on the first sneak attack the rogue makes against a particular creature in an encounter.

        \subcf{Confusing Ambush*}
        The rogue makes a Trick power vs. Mental attack against the creature damaged by this ambush attack.
        Success means the struck creature is \dazed for 2 rounds.
        Critical success means it is instead \confused for 2 rounds.
        This is an ambush attack, and only works once per creature.

        \subcf{Distracting Ambush*}
        A creature damaged by this ambush attack automatically fails any Concentration checks it makes that round.
        This is an ambush attack, and only works once per creature.

        \subcf{Distant Precision}
        The rogue can make sneak attacks from up to 100 feet away.

        \subcf{Hamstring*}
        A creature damaged by this ambush attack has its land speed halved for 5 rounds.
        Despite the name, this can be used on creatures who do not have hamstrings.
        This is an ambush attack, and only works once per creature.

        \subcf{Merciful Blows}
        The rogue suffers no penalty to damage when attacking for \glossterm{nonlethal damage}, and can deal your full sneak attack damage when attacking nonlethally.

        %\subcf{Swift Poisoner}
        %The rogue can apply poison to a weapon you are holding as a swift action.

        \subcf{Tricky Maneuver}
        When performing a \glossterm{maneuver} against an \glossterm{overwhelmed} or \unaware creature, the rogue gains a bonus to accuracy equal to the number of sneak attack dice she would roll.
        The benefits of this trick apply even against creatures immune to critical hits.

        \subcf{8th -- Brutal Ambush*}
        The rogue rolls d8s instead of d6s for your sneak attack dice on this ambush attack.
        This is an ambush attack, and only works once per creature.

        \subcf{8th -- Immobilizing Ambush*}
        A creature damaged by this ambush is \immobilized for 2 rounds.
        This is an ambush attack, and only works once per creature.

        \subcf{12th -- Agonizing Ambush*}
        The rogue makes a Trick power vs. Mental attack against the struck creature.
        Success means that the target feels agonizing pain for 2 rounds.
        Whenever it takes physical damage, it takes additional physical damage equal to the rogue's trick power.
        This is an ambush attack, and only works once per creature.

        \subcf{12th -- Assassination}
        To use this ability, the rogue must spend a full round studying a creature within 100 feet of your who has not noticed your and who is not in combat.
        If she make a melee sneak attack against that target within 1 round, your attack deals maximum damage, including your sneak attack damage.
        If the target becomes aware of your presence before you attack, this ability has no benefit.

        \subcf{12th -- Perfect Precision}
        The rogue has no range limit on your sneak attacks.

        \subcf{16th -- Deadly Ambush*}
        The rogue makes a Trick power vs. Fortitude attack against the struck creature.
        Success means the target is \staggered, and dies if it loses all its hit points for 2 rounds.
        Critical success means the target immediately dies.
        This is an ambush attack, and only works once per creature.
        In addition, dying in this way is a \glossterm{Death} effect.

        \subcf{20th -- Dual Ambush}
        The rogue can apply the benefits of two ambush attacks to a single sneak attack.

        \subcf{20th -- Lingering Ambush}
        The effects of the rogue's ambush attacks last ten times longer than normal.
        This has no effect on ambush attacks that have no duration.

        \cf{Rog}[5th]{Lucky Slip}[Mag]
        The rogue gains an additional \glossterm{legend point}.
        Once per round, when you spend a legend point to force a foe to reroll a \glossterm{strike}, she may use this ability to treat the reroll as a 1.

        \cf{Rog}[7th]{Improved Uncanny Dodge}
        The rogue reduces your overwhelm penalties by 2.
        This does not stack with the effects of uncanny dodge.
        If your overwhelm penalty is reduced to 0, you are not considered to be overwhelmed.

        \cf{Rog}[9th]{Lucky Break}[Mag]
        The rogue gains an additional \glossterm{legend point}.
        Once per round, when you spend a legend point to reroll a skill check, she may use this ability to treat the reroll as a 20.

        \cf{Rog}[11th]{Slippery Mind}
        The rogue gains a \plus4 bonus to Mental defense.

        \cf{Rog}[13th]{Lucky Dodge}[Mag]
        The rogue gains an additional \glossterm{legend point}.
        In addition, she can use your lucky slip ability against all attacks, not just strikes.

        \cf{Rog}[15th]{Persistent Sneak Attack}
        The rogue can make two sneak attacks per round, rather than one.

        \cf{Rog}[17th]{Legendary Luck}[Mag]
        The rogue gains an additional \glossterm{legend point}.
        She can always use legend points, even when fighting monsters that normally prevent legend points from being used.

        \cf{Rog}[19th]{Ambush Master}
        The rogue's ambush attacks function on the first attack the rogue makes against a particular creature in a single round, rather than within a single encounter.

    \subsection{Warp Damage}\label{Warp Damage}
        A spellwarped can use the innate magic within your body to generate powerful magical effects.
        However, doing so is physically taxing.
        Most spellwarped abilities cause the spellwarped to take some amount of \glossterm{warp damage}.
        Warp damage cannot be cured by effects that restore hit points, effectively reducing the spellwarped's maximum hit points.

        A spellwarped cannot voluntarily take warp damage that would exceed half your maximum hit points.
        An hour of rest cures warp damage equal to a character's level.

    \subsection{Base Class Abilities}
        A character with spellwarped as a base class gains the following abilities.

        \classbasics{Skill Points} 5.

        \classbasics{Defenses} \plus4 to one defense, \plus2 to other defenses (see the Innate Magic ability, below).

        \classbasics{Action Points} \plus3.

        \cf{Spl}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
        A spellwarped is proficient with simple weapons, any two weapon groups, light and medium armor, and shields.

        \cf{Spl}{Warp Regeneration}[Mag]
        The spellwarped does not need to rest to cure warp damage.
        He automatically heals warp damage equal to your level every hour, regardless of any activity he takes in the meantime.
        If he rests, he also recovers warp damage for resting, doubling the warp damage he heals.

    \subsection{Class Abilities}
        All spellwarped have the following abilities.

        \cf{Spl}{Spellpower}
        The strength of a spellwarped's spells and abilities are determined by your spellpower.
        Your spellpower is equal to your key attribute or your character level, whichever is higher.

        \cf{Spl}{Innate Magic}
        Each spellwarped draws your magical power from a particular kind of magic.
        This is a choice made when the first level of the class is taken, and it cannot thereafter be changed.
        The choices are listed below.
        Your choice of innate magic is not a \glossterm{magical} ability, but the active ability granted by that choice is a magical ability.

        \subcf{Alteration}
        The spellwarped can manipulate the physical forms of creatures.
        Your good defense is Fortitude, your key attribute is Intelligence, and he treats Disguise, Escape Artist, and Jump as class skills.
        An alteration spellwarped may be called an alterer, bodywarper, or shifter.

        As a standard action, he can change minor aspects of your appearance, such as removing a mole or lengthening your beard.
        This can grant you a \plus2 bonus to Disguise checks.
        Major changes are not possible.

        \subcf{Pyromancy}
        The spellwarped can manipulate fire and heat.
        Your good defense is Fortitude, your key attribute is Willpower, and he treats Acrobatics, Jump, and Sprint as class skills.
        A pyromancy spellwarped may be called a pyromancer.

        As a standard action, he can snap your fingers to create a small ember of flame in your hand for 5 minutes.
        This ember casts light as a torch, and can deal 1 point of fire damage with a successful touch attack.
        It can be dismissed as a swift action or extinguished as a move action.

        \subcf{Telekinesis}
        The spellwarped can manipulate objects and creatures with your mind.
        Your good defense is Mental, your key attribute is Willpower, and he treats Devices, Escape Artist, and Sleight of Hand as class skills.
        A telekinesis spellwarped may be called a telekine.

        As a standard action, he can concentrate to move objects within ten feet of you telekinetically.
        He can slowly lift or manipulate one object by up to one foot per round.
        The object can weigh up to five pounds.
        This level of control is insufficient to make skill checks or wield a weapon or shield effectively.

        \subcf{Temporal}
        The spellwarped can manipulate time.
        Your good defense is Reflex, your key attribute is Perception, and he treats Awareness, Sleight of Hand, and Sprint as class skills.
        A temporal spellwarped may be called a temporalist or timewarper.

        The spellwarped always knows exactly what time it is, and can track the passage of time precisely without effort.

        \cf{Spl}{Invocation}
        A spellwarped can invoke your innate magic to generate powerful effects.
        He chooses a single invocation at 1st level from those available based on your choice of innate magic.
        Using an invocation inflicts \glossterm{warp damage} to the spellwarped equal to half the minimum spellwarped level required to learn the invocation (minimum 1).

        At your 4th spellwarped level, and every two spellwarped levels thereafter, you gain an additional invocation.
        Some invocations have minimum spellwarped levels, as indicated in the title of the ability.
        The list of invocations is given at \pcref{Invocations}.

        The spellwarped's accuracy with invocations is equal to your spellpower.

        \cf{Spl}[2nd]{Spellwarped Body}[Mag]
        The spellwarped's body is fundamentally altered by exposure to magic.
        He shows signs of the magic coursing through your body: strangely or inconsistently colored hair, natural skin markings which often resemble runes, and so on.
        Anyone observing the spellwarped can make an Awareness or Spellcraft check with a DR equal to 20 \sub your spellwarped level to recognize that the character is a spellwarped.
        Critical success on the check allows the observer to determine the type of innate magic the spellwarped has.
        In addition, the spellwarped gains an ability based on your innate magic.
        \subcf{Alteration -- Sturdy Body}
        The spellwarped gains a \plus2 bonus to your Fortitude defense.
        This bonus increases by 1 at spellpower 5 and every 5 spellpower thereafter.
        \subcf{Pyromancy -- Energy Resistance}
        The spellwarped gains \glossterm{damage reduction} against cold and fire damage equal to twice your spellpower.
        \subcf{Telekinesis -- Tactile Telekinesis}
        The spellwarped gains a \plus2 bonus to Strength and Dexterity-based checks.
        This bonus increases by 1 at spellpower 5 and every 5 spellpower thereafter.
        \subcf{Temporal -- Accelerated Movement}
        The spellwarped gains a \plus2 bonus to your Reflex defense and a \plus10 foot bonus to your movement speed.
        At spellpower 8, 14, and 20, the defense bonus increases by 1 and the speed bonus increases by 10 feet.

        \cf{Spl}[3rd]{Magical Senses}[Mag]
        The spellwarped learns to recognize the telltale signs of your chosen magic.
        He must concentrate as a standard action to use this ability, and he may do so any number of times per day.
        \subcf{Alteration -- Perceive Alteration}
        The spellwarped can discern the true form of all creatures within 50 feet of you for 1 round, ignoring any effects which magically alter their shapes.
        This also grants you a \plus5 bonus to Awareness checks to see through disguises.
        \subcf{Pyromancy -- Flame of Life}
        The spellwarped can see the life-fire that lies within all living creatures, allowing you to clearly see all living creatures within 50 feet of you for 1 round.
        It also allows the spellwarped to see unusually warm objects, such as fires.
        This is a \glossterm{Detection} ability, and it can penetrate up to 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.
        \subcf{Telekinesis -- Spatial Awareness}
        The spellwarped can feel the forms of all objects and creatures around you, granting blindsense out to a 50 foot range for 1 round.
        \subcf{Temporal -- Rapid Search}
        The spellwarped can accelerate your mind to immediately search everything within a 10 foot radius of you with the Awareness skill as a standard action.
        Alternately, he may use this ability to read a book ten times as fast as normal.

            \subcf{4th -- Haste}
            This invocation functions like the \spell{haste} spell.

            \subcf{6th -- Flash Step}
            As a move action, the spellwarped can accelerate a willing creature within \rngclose range so much that he can seem to pause time for everyone but the target.
            This allows the target to immediately take a single move action.
            During this move action, the target moves at double speed, cannot be followed or withdrawn from, and may move through squares occupied by creatures or threatened by blocking enemies without penalty.
            The target still suffers the effects of any environmental hazards.
            \subcf{6th -- Slow}
            This invocation functions like the \spell{slow} spell.

            \subcf{8th -- Inhuman Speed}
            As a move action, the spellwarped can accelerate himself to immense speed, allowing you to move up to five times your speed.
            During this time, he cannot be followed or withdrawn from, can move through squares occupied by enemies or threatened by blocking enemies without penalty, and can treat liquids as if they were solid ground.

            \subcf{10th -- Timestream}
            The spellwarped manipulates time in a \arealarge, 10 ft.\ wide line-shaped zone that extends out from you for 5 rounds.
            All creatures and objects that pass through the line are \slowed for 1 round.
            The spellwarped can exclude your allies from the effect.
            The timestream is virtually invisible, requiring a DR 30 Awareness check to notice in a clear environment, though objects passing through the effect can make it more obvious.
            \subcf{10th -- Mass Haste}
            This invocation functions like the \spell{haste} spell with the Mass augment applied.

            \subcf{12th -- Mass Flash Step}
            This invocation functions like the flashstep invocation, except that it affects up to five willing creatures.
            \subcf{12th -- Mass Slow}
            This invocation functions like the \spell{slow} spell with the Mass augment applied.

            \subcf{16th -- Time Reversal}
            As a swift action, the spellwarped can take one warp damage to create a ``time lock.'' The time lock persists for one round.
            As a standard action, he can take eight warp damage to make a Spellpower vs. Mental attack a creature within \rngmed range to reverse time for it.
            Success means the target is restored to its exact condition at the point immediately after the time lock was created.
            The effects of any actions that the creature took in the intervening time are undone, any damage it dealt or took is removed, it is returned to its original location, and the creature is restored in all other ways, just as if the intervening time had never occured.
            If its original location is occupied, the time reversal fails.
            The spellwarped cannot reverse time for himself in this way.
            \par After reversing time in this way, the spellwarped must wait 5 rounds before he can create a time lock or reverse time again.
            \subcf{16th -- Supreme Acceleration}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped can accelerate himself so much that he can take an additional round of actions immediately.
            During this round, all creatures he attacks are treated as \helpless, but he cannot perform a \glossterm{coup de grace} or similar ability; such an act requires more care and precision than is possible with such immense speed.
            After using this ability, he must wait 5 rounds before he can use it again.

            \subcf{18th -- Time Stop}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped can step into an alternate timestream, causing you to speed up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen.
            He can act for 1d3\plus1 rounds of apparent time.
            During this time, all objects and creatures are frozen in place and are completely invulnerable to the spellwarped, though he may affect them with invocations normally.
            After using this ability, he must wait 5 rounds before he can use it again.

\section{Multiclass Characters}\label{Multiclass Characters}
    A character may add new classes as he or you progress in level, thus becoming a multiclass character.
    The class abilities from a character's different classes combine to determine a multiclass character's overall abilities.
    Multiclassing improves a character's versatility at the expense of focus.

    \subsection{Class And Level Features}
        As a general rule, the abilities of a multiclass character are the sum
        of the abilities of each of the character's classes.

        \parhead{Level}
        ``Character level'' is a character's total number of levels.
        It is used to determine when feats and attribute score boosts are gained, as noted on \tref{Character Advancement}.
        Whenever a creature's ``level'' is specified, without reference to a particular class, the character level is used.

        \par ``Class level'' is a character's level in a particular class.
        For a character whose levels are all in the same class, character level and class level are the same.

        \parhead{Hit Points}
        The normal rules for determining hit points apply to multiclass characters.

        \parhead{Defenses}
        The normal rules for determining defenses apply to multiclass characters.

        \parhead{Skills}
        A multiclass character gains all class skills from all of your classes.
        However, only the character's base class grants skill points.
        If a character has multiple base classes, he must choose which base class grants skill points.
        When a character gains new class skills, he may redistribute your skill points to gain training or mastery in your new class skills.

        \parhead{Class Abilities}
        A multiclass character gets all the class abilities of all your or your classes, but must also suffer the consequences of the special restrictions of all your or your classes.

        \par In some cases, two classes can have virtually identical abilities.
        Use the following guidelines to determine how abilities stack.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If two identical class abilities are not based on level and are not gained following a specific pattern, they do not stack.
            \item If two identical class abilities are not explicitly based on level, but both classes gain them in a predictable pattern, the levels of the two classes stack for determining when the next improvement to the class ability will be gained.
            \item If two identical class abilities are explicitly based on level, the levels of the two classes stack for determining the power of the ability.
            \item If two identical class abilities say how they stack, those rules trump any other rules.
        \end{itemize}
        These are some examples of how to use these guidelines.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Both a druid and a ranger gain wild speech.
                A druid/ranger who has wild speech from both classes has the same wild speech ability as a druid or ranger would.
            \item Both a barbarian and a rogue get uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge at the same level.
                A barbarian/rogue adds your barbarian and rogue levels together to determine when he acquires improved uncanny dodge.
        \end{itemize}

        \parhead{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
        Only a character's base class grants weapon and armor proficiencies.
        If a character has multiple base classes, she must choose which base class grants weapon and armor profiencies.
