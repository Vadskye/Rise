\chapter{Classes}\label{Classes}

Your character's class represents the things your character has chosen to train in.
This choice determines a great deal about your character's abilities.

\section{How Classes Work}
    When you first create a character, you choose a class.
    You gain all abilities granted by the \glossterm{archetypes} of your chosen class at the levels indicated in the archetype's description (see Archetypes, below).
    As you gain levels, you gain more abilities from your class.

    \subsection{Archetypes}\label{Archetypes}
        Each class has three or four \glossterm{archetypes}.
        An archetype is a collection of thematically related class abilities.
        For examples, barbarians have the Battlerager archetype, which grants abilities related to flying into a rage in combat.

        Normally, you choose three of the archetypes associated with your class at 1st level.
        You gain the abilities from those three archetypes, and you gain no abilities from any additional archetypes the class has.

        \subsubsection{Archetype Ranks}\label{Archetype Ranks}
            You have an \glossterm{archetype rank} associated with each archetype you have.
            Each ability from an archetype has a minimum rank required to gain the ability.

            At 1st level, you are Rank 1 in each archetype.
            This gives you the Rank 1 abilities from each of your archetypes.
            Every level thereafter, you increase your rank in one archetype of your choice.
            This gives you the abilities associated with that rank.

            Each \glossterm{archetype rank} has a minimum level, as shown on \trefnp{Archetype Ranks by Level}.

            \begin{dtable}
                \lcaption{Archetype Ranks by Level}
                \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{>{\ccol}p{\levelcol} >{\lcol}X}
                    \tb{Archetype Rank} & \tb{Minimum Level} \\\bottomrule

                \end{dtabularx}
            \end{dtable}

        \subsubsection{Duplicate Archetypes}\label{Duplicate Archetypes}
            Some archetypes can be gained by multiple classes.
            For example, both clerics and paladins have the Divine Spellcasting archetype.
            You cannot gain two archetypes with the same name, even if you can choose archetypes from multiple classes.

\section{Class Introductions}

    There are nine classes in Rise.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Barbarians are mighty warriors who can enter a deadly battlerage.
        \item Clerics are divine spellcasters who draw power from their veneration of a deity.
        \item Druids are nature spellcasters who draw power from their veneration of the natural world.
        \item Fighters are highly disciplined warriors who excel in physical combat of any variety.
        \item Mages are arcane spellcasters who wield the mystic forces of magic to create almost any effect.
        \item Monks are agile masters of ``ki'' who hone their personal abilities to strike down foes and perform supernatural feats.
        \item Paladins are divinely empowered warriors whose devotion to an alignment grants them the ability to discern and smite their foes.
        \item Rangers are skilled hunters who bridge the divide between nature and civilization.
        \item Rogues are exceptionally skillful characters known for their ability to strike at their foe's weak points in combat.
            % \item Spellwarped wield a unique blend of martial skill and narrowly focused magical abilities.
        \item Warlocks are pact spellcasters who draw their power from a dark pact made with infernal creatures.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Class Description Format}
        Each class is described from the perspective of a member of that class, using ``you'' in the description.

        \parhead{Class Table}
        The class's table describes the special abilities a member of that class gains at each level, assuming they have all of that class's \glossterm{archetypes}.

        \parhead{Alignment}
        Some classes require specific alignments (see \pcref{Alignment}).
        Most classes allow characters of any alignment.

        \parhead{Skills}
        Each class has specific \glossterm{skills} that members of that class are typically good at (see \pcref{Skills}).
        These skills are called \glossterm{class skills}.
        It is easier to become \glossterm{mastered} in class skills than in other skills.
        For details, see \pcref{Skill Training}.

        \parhead{Defenses}
        Each class grants bonuses to specific defenses.

        \parhead{Weapon and Armor Proficiencies}
        These are the types of equipment that members of this class are trained in using.

        \parhead{Other Special Abilities}
        Some classes have abilities shared by all members of the class that are not part of an archetype, such as a druid's \textit{druidic language} ability.

        \parhead{Archetypes}
        The abilities associated with each of the three archetypes the class has.

                Choose a dead creature adjacent to you.
                If it was dead for no more than 5 minutes, it is restored to life, as the \ritual{resurrection} ritual.

            \parhead{Mastery} When you are affected by a \glossterm{magical} ability, you heal hit points equal to your \glossterm{power}.
            This healing applies even if the spell has an attack that fails to beat your defenses.
            It stacks with the healing from this domain's essence if you target yourself with a spell.

        \subsubsection{Strength}

            \end{apability}
            \parhead{Mastery} When you move, you can teleport the same distance instead.

                You must also choose a belief that the target has.
                The belief may be a lie that you told it, or even a simple misunderstanding (such as believing a hidden creature is not present in a room).
                If the creature does not already hold the chosen belief, this ability automatically fails.
                \hit The target continues to maintain the chosen belief, regardless of any evidence to the contrary.
                It will interpret any evidence that the falsehood is incorrect to be somehow wrong -- an illusion, a conspiracy to decieve it, or any other reason it can think of to continue believing the falsehood.
                At the end of the effect, the creature can decide whether it believes the falsehood or not, as normal.
            \end{apability}
            \parhead{Mastery} You are undetectable by Divination spells and effects.

                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Legion: If the spell would normally affect five or more specific targets, it instead affects five times that many targets.
                    \item Selective: If the spell has an area, you may freely exclude any areas from the spell's effect.
                    All squares in the final area of the spell must be contiguous.
                    You cannot create split a spell's area into multiple completely separate areas.
                    \item Widened: If the spell has an area, the size of the area is doubled.
                \end{itemize}
                You cannot use this ability on spells with the \glossterm{Attune} tag.
            \end{apability}
            \parhead{Mastery} You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with \glossterm{physical attacks}.

                You can speak with and command water within a \areahuge zone from your location.
                You can ask the water simple questions and understand its responses.
                If you command the water to perform a task, it will do so do the best of its ability until this effect ends.
                You cannot compel the water to move faster than 30 feet per round.

                After you use this ability on a particular area of water, you cannot use it again on that same area for 24 hours.
            \end{attuneability}
            \parhead{Mastery}
            When you move, you can transform yourself into a rushing flow of water with a volume roughly equal to your normal volume until your movement is complete.
            In this form, you may move wherever water could go, you cannot take other actions, such as jumping, attacking, or casting spells.
            You may move through squares occupied by enemies without penalty.
            \par Your speed is halved when moving uphill and doubled when moving downhill.
            Unusually steep inclines may cause greater movement differences while in this form.
            \par If the water is split, you may reform from anywhere the water has reached, to as little as a single ounce of water.
            If not even an ounce of water exists contiguously, your body reforms from all of the largest available sections of water, cut into pieces of appropriate size.
            This usually causes you to die.

        \subsubsection{Wild}
            If you choose this domain, you add the \sphere{verdamancy} \glossterm{mystic sphere} to your list of divine mystic spheres (see \pcref{Mystic Spheres}).

            \parhead{Aspect} This ability functions like the \textit{wild aspect} druid ability from the Natural Influence archetype (see \pcref{Natural Influence}), except that you cannot spend \glossterm{insight points} to learn additional wild aspects.
            \parhead{Essence} You learn an additional \textit{wild aspect}.

            If you grossly violate the code of conduct required by your deity, you lose all spells and magical cleric class abilities.
            You cannot regain those abilities until you atone for your transgressions to your deity.

    \classbasics{Alignment} Neutral good, lawful neutral, neutral, chaotic neutral, or neutral evil.

    \classbasics{Archetypes} Druids have the Beastmaster, Nature Spellcasting, Nature Spell Mastery, and Shifter \glossterm{archetypes}.

    \subsection{Basic Class Abilities}
        If you are a druid, you gain the following abilities.

        \cf{Drd}{Defenses}
        You gain the following bonuses to your \glossterm{defenses}: \plus5 Fortitude, \plus3 Reflex, \plus4 Mental.

        \cf{Drd}{Skills}
        You have the following \glossterm{class skills}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \subparhead{Strength} Climb, Jump, Swim.
            \item \subparhead{Dexterity} Acrobatics, Ride, Stealth.
            \item \subparhead{Intelligence} Craft, Deduction, Heal, Knowledge (geography, nature).
            \item \subparhead{Perception} Awareness, Creature Handling, Survival.
            \item \subparhead{Other} Bluff, Intimidate, Persuasion, Profession.
        \end{itemize}

        \cf{Drd}{Weapon and Armor Proficiencies}
        Druids are proficient with simple weapons, any one other weapon group, scimitars, sickles, and slings.
        In addition, druids are proficient with light armor, medium armor, and shields.
        However, a druid cannot use metal armor; see the Metal Abhorrence ability, below.

        \cf{Drd}{Druidic Language}
        You know Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, in addition to your normal languages.
        Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.
        Druidic has its own alphabet.

        \cf{Drd}{Metal Abhorrence}
        The oaths that you swear as part of your druidic initiation prohibit you from wearing armor made of metal.
        If you wear prohibited armor or carry a prohibited shield, you are unable to cast druid spells or use any of your \glossterm{magical} druid abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.

        You can avoid this penalty by using armor made of wood altered with the \ritual{ironwood} ritual.
        Such wood is as strong as steel.

    \subsection{Shifter}\label{Shifter}
        This archetype grants you the ability to embody aspects of the natural world in your own form.

        \cf{Drd}[1]{Shifting Defense} You gain a \plus1 bonus to Armor defense.

        \cf{Drd}[2]{Wild Aspect}[Magical]
        You gain the ability to embody an aspect of an animal or of nature itself.
        Choose a single wild aspect from the list below.
        You can also spend \glossterm{insight points} to learn one additional \textit{wild aspect} per \glossterm{insight point}.

        As a \glossterm{standard action}, you can gain the effects of one wild aspect that you know.
        That effect lasts until you activate a different wild aspect you know.

        The abilities in the list below describe the effects of the aspect.
        Your appearance also changes to match the aspect's effects, but the nature of this change is not described.
        Different druids change in different ways.
        For example, one druid might grow brown fur when using the Form of the Bear, while another might instead change their face to become broader and more bear-shaped when embodying the same aspect.
        You choose how your appearance changes when you gain a wild aspect.
        This change cannot be used to gain an additional substantive benefit beyond the effects given in the description of the aspect.

        Many wild aspects grant natural weapons.
        See \pcref{Natural Weapons}, for details about natural weapons.

        If you die, except if by old age, you may choose to have your body and soul become an instrument of nature's will.
        Your body immediately decomposes or otherwise disappears, and your soul does not travel to an afterlife.
        You has no physical form, and cannot use any of your normal abilities.
        Instead, you have a \glossterm{fly speed} of 100 feet, with special maneuverability.
        As a standard action, you can temporarily possess any living plants or animals within a 10 mile radius of the place of your death.

        While possessing a living plant or animal, you can see through its senses and control its actions completely.
        In addition, you may cast spells, and the spells take effect as if the plant or animal had cast them.
        You use the plant or animal's position to determine range, visible targets, and so on.
        You do not require \glossterm{verbal components} to cast your spells in this form.
        % TODO: are there any spells or rituals that have material components or focus objects?
        % but are unable to cast spells or perform rituals that require material components or focus objects.

        While not possessing a plant or animal, you can rest, or you can focus on reincarnating your physical form.
        Creating a new body in this way takes 12 consecutive hours of concentration.
        At the end of that time, you are reincarnated in a new body in your location, as the effect of the \ritual{reincarnation} ritual, except that you can choose your species from among the species listed (not including the ``Other'' species).

        While you are an avatar of nature, you do not age and you cannot die of old age.
        You can continue to exist in this form indefinitely.

    \subsection{Beastmaster}
        This archetype improves your connection to animals, allowing you to control and command them in battle.

        \cf{Drd}[1]{Animal Speech}[Magical] You can use the \textit{wild speech} ability as a standard action.
        \begin{attuneability}{Wild Speech}[\glossterm{Attune} (self)]
            Choose an animal within \rnglong range.
            You can speak to and understand the speech of the target animal, and any other animals of the same species.

            This ability does not make the target any more friendly or cooperative than normal.
            Wary and cunning animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while stupid ones tend to make inane comments and are unlikely to say or understand anything of use.
        \end{attuneability}

        \cf{Drd}[2]{Animal Companion}
        You can use the \textit{animal companion} ability as a standard action.

            Choose a willing animal within your \glossterm{reach}.
            The target serves as a loyal companion to you.
            It follows your directions to the best of its ability.
            Animals are unable to understand complex concepts, so their ability to obey convoluted instructions is limited.

            Your magical connection to the animal improves its resilience and strength in combat.
            If any of its statistics are higher than the normal values below, the animal uses its own statistics instead.
            Its hit points are normally equal to three times your \glossterm{power}.
            Each of its defenses is normally equal to 4 \add your level.
            Its \glossterm{accuracy} is normally equal to the higher of your level and Perception.
            Its \glossterm{power} with its attacks is normally equal to your \glossterm{power}.
            All other aspects of the animal, such as its speed and natural weapons, are unchanged.
        \end{attuneability}

        \cf{Drd}[3]{Beast Lore} You gain two additional \glossterm{skill points}.

        \cf{Drd}[4]{Greater Wild Speech} When you use your \textit{wild speech} ability, you do not have to target an animal.
        Instead, you understand the speech of animals of any species.

        \cf{Drd}[5]{Beast Companion} When you use your \textit{animal companion} ability,
        you can target a willing \glossterm{magical beast} with an Intelligence of \minus6 or lower.

        \cf{Drd}[6]{Beast Tamer} You gain a \plus4 bonus to the Creature Handling skill (see \pcref{Creature Handling}).

        \cf{Drd}[8]{True Companion} When you use your \textit{animal companion} ability,
        you can target any willing creature with an Intelligence of \minus6 or lower.

        % \subcf{15th -- Air Mantle}

        % \subcf{15th -- Aqueous Step}
        % Wherever the druid moves, you leave a path of animated water that can grab creatures.

        % A failed attack deals half damage.
        % \subcf{15th -- Lifegiving Step}
        % Wherever the druid moves, you leave a path of small, living plants that entangle foes for 1 round.
        % When a creature crosses the path, the druid makes a Reflex attack to entangle the creature, causing it to waste the rest of its movement.
        % Your accuracy is equal to your druid level \add your Constitution.
        % The plants appear on any surface, and will continue to grow if they can survive, though they may die quickly if they appear on inhospitable terrain.
        % \subcf{17th -- Flaming Soul}
        % You gain the fire subtype, making your immune to fire but giving your a 50\% vulnerability to cold damage.
        % In addition, when you deal fire damage to a creature, the creature is \ignited for 5 rounds.
        % \subcf{17th -- Sunblessed Rejuvenation}
        % You gain fast healing equal to your druid level as long as you remain in sunlight or touches a plant of your size or larger.
        % \subcf{17th -- Sunscour}
        % This aspect functions like the heart of the sun natural aspect, except that it also suppresses shadow effects and the visual components of illusions within the area of bright light.

        % \subcf{17th -- Water's Flow}
        % As a minor action, the druid can transform herself into a rushing flow of water with a volume roughly equal to your normal volume until the end of your turn.
        % In this form, she may move wherever water could go, but she cannot take other actions, such as jumping, attacking, or casting spells.
        % Your speed is halved when moving uphill and doubled when moving downhill.
        % She may move through squares occupied by enemies without penalty.
        % She may return to your normal form as a free action.
        % \par If the water is split, she may reform from anywhere the water has reached, to as little as a single ounce of water.
        % If not even an ounce of water exists contiguously, your body reforms from the largest available parts of water, cut into pieces of appropriate size.
        % This usually causes the druid to die.

    \subsection{Ex-Druids}
        A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and magical druid class abilities.
        She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until you atone for your transgressions.

        % \subsection{Variant Druids}

        %     \subsubsection{Blighter}

        %         Blighters draw power from nature, as do other druids. However, while other druids revere nature and draw power from it gently, blighters steal power from nature forcefully. Wherever a blighter goes, destruction and death surely follows.

        %         \altcf{Blight} Instead of meditating to regain spell slots, a blighter draws power from your environment forcefully.
        %         This affects a \areahuge radius zone centered on your, and the process takes 1 minute of concentration.
        %         At the end of every round, every living thing in the area other than the blighter takes damage equal to your nature power.
        %         All inanimate plants of Huge size or smaller immediately wither and die.
        %         The earth becomes cracked and infertile, and any nutrients from the soil are destroyed.
        %         This ability has no effect on artificial environments or materials, such as metal or worked stone.
        %         At the end of the minute, the blighter regains your spent nature spell slots.

        %         A blighter can only blight your surroundings in this way once per hour.
        %         If your surroundings are already blighted or are not natural terrain, she cannot use this ability to regain your spells.
        %         Instead, she must meditate for 8 hours to slowly draw power from your surroundings, as a normal druid.

        %         \altcf{Spells} As normal, except that a blighter adds all Vivimancy arcane spells to your spell list.

        %         \altcf[2]{Wild Speech} As normal, except that a blighter gains a \plus5 bonus to Intimidate against your wild speech targets, and a \minus5 penalty to Persuasion.

        %         \altcf[10]{Blightcasting}

        %         \altcf[20]{Improved Blightcasting}

        % \subsubsection{Rotbringer}

        %     While most druids seek to emulate and interact with animals, rotbringers focus on the power of fungi, decay, and regeneration.

        %     \altcf{Invoke Rot} Instead of meditating to regain spell slots, a rotbringer accelerates the natural forces of decomposition and decay on your environment.
        %     This affects a \areahuge radius zone centered on your, and the process takes 1 minute of concentration.
        %     All organic objects of Huge size or smaller, such as plants and corpses, decompose.
        %     This decomposition kills inanimate, living plants.
        %     All organic objects, regardless of size, are covered with various fungi.
        %     This ability has no effect on artificial environments or materials, such as metal or worked stone.
        %     At the end of the minute, the rotbringer regains your spent nature spell slots.

        %     If the rotbringer decomposes a Huge object with this ability, or a combination of smaller objects equivalent in size to a Huge object, you gain an bonus nature spell slot of your highest available spell level.
        %     This extra spell slot lasts until it is used, or until you regain your spell slots again.

        %     A rotbringer can only invoke rot on your surroundings in this way once per hour.
        %     If your surroundings are already decomposed or are not natural terrain, she cannot use this ability to regain your spells.
        %     Instead, she must meditate for 8 hours to slowly draw power from your surroundings, as a normal druid.

        %     \altcf[2]{Wild Speech} The rotbringer gains the ability to speak with plants at 2nd level.
        %     You gain the ability to speak with animals at 6th level, instead of at 2nd level.

        %     \altcf[3rd]{Wild Aspect} The rotbringer does not gain this ability.

        %     \altcf[3rd]{Rot Spell} The druid learns an additional spell slot and spell known.
        %     The spell must be taken from the following list of spells.
        %     The spell's level cannot exceed half your druid level.
        %     If she already knows a spell from the list at every spell level you ha access to, she may instead learn any nature spell (see \pcref{Nature Spells}).

        %     At 5th level, and every odd level, the druid may learn a new spell.

        \cf{Mge}[2]{Rituals} You gain the ability to perform arcane rituals to create unique magical effects (see \pcref{Rituals}).
        The maximum level of arcane ritual you can learn or perform is equal to the maximum level of arcane spell that you can cast.

        \cf{Mge}[3]{Scholastic Insight}[Magical]
        You gain one of the following insights.
        Some insights can be chosen multiple times, as indicated in their descriptions.

        {
            \parhead{Expanded Sphere Access} You gain access to a new \glossterm{mystic sphere}.
            \par You cannot choose this insight multiple times.

            \parhead{Expanded Spell Knowledge} You learn an additional \glossterm{spell}.
            \par You can choose this insight multiple times, learning an additional spell each time.

            \parhead{Signature Spell} Choose a \glossterm{spell} you know.
            You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with that spell.
            In addition, you gain a \plus5 bonus to \glossterm{concentration} checks you make to cast that spell.
            \par If you choose this insight multiple times, you must choose a different \glossterm{spell} each time.

            \parhead{Sphere Specialization} Choose a a \glossterm{mystic sphere} you have access to.
            You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with abilities from that \glossterm{mystic sphere}.
            In addition, you learn an additional \glossterm{spell} from that \glossterm{mystic sphere}.
            In exchange, you must lose access to another \glossterm{mystic sphere} you have.
            You must exchange all spells you know from that \glossterm{mystic sphere} with spells from other \glossterm{mystic spheres} you have access to.
            \par You cannot choose this insight multiple times.

            \parhead{Memorized Sphere} % TODO: clarify you need to be high enough level?
            Choose a \glossterm{mystic sphere} you have access to.
            You can perform rituals from that \glossterm{mystic sphere} without having them written in your ritual book.
            If you lead a ritual from that \glossterm{mystic sphere}, it requires half the normal amount of time to perform and costs half the normal number of action points (minimum 1).
            \par You can choose this insight multiple times, choosing a different \glossterm{mystic sphere} each time.
        }

        \cf{Mge}[4]{Ritual Expertise} Each \glossterm{action point} you spend performing a \glossterm{ritual} contributes two action points towards the ritual's cost.

        % This may be a better fit?
        % \cf{Mge}[4]{Scholastic Knowledge} You gain a \plus2 bonus to all Knowledge skills.

        \cf{Mge}[5]{Contingency}  You learn the Contingency \glossterm{augment}, allowing you to prepare a spell so it takes effect automatically if specific circumstances arise.
        The Contingency \glossterm{augment} adds two levels to a spell's level.
        You can apply this augment to any arcane spell.
        % If any spells take more than one standard action, they would need to be excluded from Contingency, but none exist
        % You can apply this augment to any arcane spell that can be cast as a \glossterm{standard action} or \glossterm{minor action}.

        Casting a spell with the Contingency augment takes 5 minutes.
        When the casting is complete, the spell has no immediate effect.
        Instead, it automatically takes effect when some specific circumstances arise.
        During the time required to cast the spell, you specify what circumstances cause the spell to take effect.

        The spell can be set to trigger in response to any circumstances that a typical human observing you and your situation could detect.
        For example, you could specify ``when I fall at least 50 feet'' or ``when I become bloodied'', but not ``when there is an invisible creature within 50 feet of me'' or ``when I am at 17 hit points or fewer.''
        The more specific the required circumstances, the better -- vague requirements, such as ``when I am in danger'', may cause the spell to trigger unexpectedly or fail to trigger at all.
        If you attempt to specify multiple separate triggering conditions, such as ``when I take damage or when an enemy is adjacent to me'', the spell will randomly ignore all but one of the conditions.

        If the spell needs to be targeted, the trigger condition can specify a simple rule for identifying how to target the spell, such as ``the closest enemy''.
        If the rule is poorly worded or imprecise, the spell may target incorrectly or fail to activate at all.
        Any spells which require decisions, such as the \spell{dimension door} spell, must have those decisions made at the time it is cast.
        You cannot alter those decisions when the contingency takes effect.

        You can have only one spell with this augment active at a time.
        If you use the augment again with a different spell, the old contingency is removed.

        \cf*{Mge}[6]{Scholastic Insight}[Magical]
        You learn an additional \textit{scholastic insight}.

        \cf{Mge}[7]{Malleable Contingency} If you have a \textit{contingency} active, you can change the conditions of your \textit{contingency} as a standard action.

    \subsection{Innate Arcanist}
        This archetype deepens your innate connection to arcane magic.
        You be a sorcerer and have the Arcane Spellcasting archetype to gain the abilities from this archetype.

        \cf{Mge}[1]{Stilled Caster} When you cast a spell, you can omit that spell's \glossterm{somatic components}.
        This tests your focus when casting the spell, forcing you to make a \glossterm{concentration} check to cast the spell successfully (see \pcref{Concentration}).

        \cf{Mge}[2]{Mystic Healing}
        When a spell resolves, if you were a target of the spell, you heal hit points equal to that spell's \glossterm{power}.
        This healing applies even if the spell's attack fails.
        You can only gain this healing once per round.
        If you are affected by multiple spells simultaneously, you can choose which spell you benefit from.

        \cf{Mge}[3]{Spell Knowledge} You learn an additional arcane \glossterm{spell}.

        \cf{Mge}[4]{Nonverbal Caster} When you cast a spell, you can omit that spell's \glossterm{verbal components}.
        This tests your focus when casting the spell, forcing you to make a \glossterm{concentration} check to cast the spell successfully (see \pcref{Concentration}).
        If you also omit the spell's \glossterm{somatic components} with your \textit{stilled caster} ability,
            you take a \minus2 penalty to the \glossterm{concentration} check to cast the spell,
            as normal when there are multiple effects testing your concentration.

        \cf{Mge}[5]{Magic Resistance} You gain a \plus2 bonus to \glossterm{defenses} against \glossterm{magical} abilities.

        \cf*{Mge}[6]{Spell Knowledge} You learn an additional arcane \glossterm{spell}.

        \cf{Mge}[7]{Spell Absorption} When a spell is used to attack you, if the attack fails to beat your defenses, you gain the ability to cast the spell once.
        The spell retains its original \glossterm{augments}, if any, and you cannot apply any \glossterm{augments} to it.
        When you cast the spell, you use your own \glossterm{accuracy}, \glossterm{power}, and abilities to determine the effects of the spell.
        You must spend an \glossterm{action point} to cast the spell.
        Once you cast the spell, you expend the absorbed energy, and you cannot cast it again.

        If you resist multiple spells simultaneously, or if you resist another spell before casting the previous spell you resisted, you choose which spell you gain the ability to cast.

    \classbasics{Alignment} Any nonchaotic.

    \classbasics{Archetypes} Monks have the Ki, Unfettered Warrior, Transcendent Sage, and Perfected Form \glossterm{archetypes}.

    \subsection{Basic Class Abilities}
        If you are a monk, you gain the following abilities.

        \cf{Mnk}{Defenses}
        You gain the following bonuses to your \glossterm{defenses}: \plus3 Fortitude, \plus5 Reflex, \plus4 Mental.

        \cf{Mnk}{Skills}
        You have the following \glossterm{class skills}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \subparhead{Strength} Climb, Jump, Swim.
            \item \subparhead{Dexterity} Acrobatics, Escape Artist, Ride, Stealth.
            \item \subparhead{Intelligence} Craft, Deduction, Heal.
            \item \subparhead{Perception} Awareness, Spellcraft, Survival.
            \item \subparhead{Other} Bluff, Intimidate, Perform, Persuasion, Profession.
        \end{itemize}

        \cf{Mnk}{Weapon and Armor Proficiencies}
        Monks are proficient with simple weapons, monk weapons, and any one other weapon group.
        Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields.

    \subsection{Ki}
        This archtype grants you abilities you can use in combat.
        If you wear armor, use a shield, or have \glossterm{encumbrance}, you lose the benefit of all abilities from this archetype.

        \cf{Mnk}[1]{Ki Barrier}[Magical]
        If you are not wearing armor and have no \glossterm{encumbrance}, you gain a ki barrier around your body.
        This functions like body armor that provides a \plus2 bonus to Armor defense and has no \glossterm{encumbrance}.

        As long as you have a free hand, the barrier also manifests as a shield that provides a \plus1 bonus to Armor defense.
        This bonus is considered to come from a shield, and does not stack with the benefits of using a physical shield.

        \cf{Mnk}[1]{Ki Strike} You can use the \textit{ki strike} ability as a standard action.
        \begin{freeability}{Ki Strike}[Magical]
            Make a melee \glossterm{strike}.
            % TODO: wording
            Because this is a \glossterm{magical} ability, you use your \glossterm{power} with magical abilities to determine your damage with the strike.
        \end{freeability}

        \cf{Mnk}[2]{Ki Manifestations}[Magical]
        You can channel your ki to temporarily enhance your abilities.
        Choose one \textit{ki manifestation} from the list below.
        You can also spend \glossterm{insight points} to learn one additional \textit{ki manifestation} per \glossterm{insight point}.
        You can use any \textit{ki manifestation} ability you know using the type of action indicated in the ability's description.
        You cannot use more than one \textit{ki manifestation} per round.
        {
            \begin{apability}{Abandon the Fragile Self}[\glossterm{Swift}]
                You can use this ability as a \glossterm{minor action}.
                Remove one \glossterm{condition} affecting you.
                Because this ability has the \glossterm{Swift} tag, the penalties from the condition do not affect you during the current phase.

                \rankline
                \rank{4} You are also immune to all \glossterm{conditions} during the current phase, preventing new conditions from being applied to you.
                \rank{6} The immunity to conditions lasts until the end of the round.
                \rank{8} The immunity to conditions lasts until the end of the next round.
            \end{apability}

            \begin{apability}{Burst of Blinding Speed}
                You can use this ability at the start of the round.
                It lasts until the end of the round.
                You gain a \plus30 foot \glossterm{magic bonus} to your land speed, up to a maximum of double your original speed.

                \rankline
                \rank{4} You can also ignore \glossterm{difficult terrain}.
                \rank{6} You can also move or stand on liquids as if they were solid.
                \rank{8} The speed bonus increases to \plus60 feet, up to a maximum of triple your original speed.
            \end{apability}

            \begin{apability}{Elegant Whirl of Fluid Motion}
                You can use this ability at the start of the round.
                It lasts until the end of the round.
                You gain a \plus5 bonus to the Acrobatics skill (see \pcref{Acrobatics}).

                \rank{4} The bonus increases to \plus10.
                \rank{6} The bonus lasts until the end of the next round.
                \rank{8} The bonus increases to \plus20.

            \begin{apability}{Flash Step}[\glossterm{Teleportation}]
                You can use this ability at the start of the round.
                It lasts until the end of the round.
                % TODO: is 'horizontally' the correct word?
                When you move, you can teleport horizontally up to half your movement speed instead.
                This replaces the entire distance you would have moved that phase.
                If your \glossterm{line of effect} to your destination is blocked, or if this teleportation would somehow place you inside a solid object, your movement is cancelled and you remain where you are.

                \rankline
                \rank{4} The movement cost to teleport is reduced to be equal to the distance you teleport.
                \rank{6} You can teleport in multiple steps within the same phase.
                Each step costs movement equal to twice the distance you teleport.
                \rank{8} You can attempt to teleport to locations outside of \glossterm{line of sight} and \glossterm{line of effect}.
                If your intended destination is invalid, the distance you spent teleporting is wasted, but you suffer no other ill effects.
            \end{apability}

            \begin{apability}{Leap of the Heavens}
                You can use this ability at the start of the round.
                It lasts until the end of the round.
                You gain a \plus5 bonus to the Jump skill (see \pcref{Jump}).

                \rankline
                \rank{4} The bonus increases to \plus10.
                \rank{6} The bonus lasts until the end of the next round.
                \rank{8} The bonus increases to \plus20.
            \end{apability}

            \begin{apability}{Scale the Highest Tower}
                You can use this ability at the start of the round.
                It lasts until the end of the round.
                You gain a \plus5 bonus to the Climb skill (see \pcref{Climb}).
                % TODO: is this wording correct?

                \rankline
                \rank{4} The Climb bonus increases to \plus10.
                \rank{6} The bonus lasts until the end of the next round.
                \rank{6} The bonus increases to \plus20.

                You can use this ability at the start of the round.
                It lasts until the end of the round.
                You gain the ability to see the ki of living creatures.
                You can ``see'' any living creatures and their equipment within 50 feet perfectly, regardless of lighting conditions, blindness, invisibility, or any other means of concealment.
                This cannot detect living creatures through solid walls, however.

                \rankline
                \rank{4} The range of the ability is increased to 100 feet.
                \rank{6} This ability gains the \glossterm{Sustain} (minor) tag.
                \rank{8} This ability gains the \glossterm{Attune} tag in place of the \glossterm{Sustain} (minor) tag.

                It lasts until the end of the round.
                You gain a \plus2 bonus to \glossterm{defenses} against \glossterm{magical} abilities that directly target you.
                This does not protect you from abilities that affect an area.

                \rankline
                \rank{4} The defense bonus is increased to \plus4.
                \rank{6} The defense bonus is increased to \plus6.
                \rank{8} You cannot be directly targeted by \glossterm{magical} abilities.
            \end{apability}

                You can use this ability at the start of the round.
                It lasts until the end of the round.
                You can use your \glossterm{power} in place of your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution when making checks.

        The reformed body is in perfect health and can be any age you choose, to a minimum of the age of adulthood for your species.
        You can reform your body at the place where you died, or in any place on the same plane that is deeply familiar to you.

        You must choose one of your alignment components: good, evil, lawful, or chaotic.
        The alignment you choose is your devoted alignment.
        Your paladin abilities are affected by this choice.
        % seems unnecessary
        % You excel at slaying creatures with alignments opposed to your devoted alignment.
        Your alignment cannot be changed without extraordinary repurcussions.

    \subsection{Devoted Paragon}
        This archetype deepens your connection to your alignment, granting you an aura and improving your combat abilities.

        You constantly radiate an aura in a \areamed radius \glossterm{emanation} from you.
        You can freely choose whether creatures in the area are targeted by the aura, including yourself.
        The effect of the aura depends on your devoted alignment, as described below.
        You can suppress or resume the aura as a \glossterm{minor action}.

        \subparhead{Chaos} When a target rolls a 1 on an attack roll with a \glossterm{strike}, it \glossterm{explodes} (see \pcref{Exploding Attacks}.
        This does not affect bonus dice rolled for exploding attacks (see \pcref{Exploding Attacks}).
        \subparhead{Evil} Once per round, when a target takes damage, it increases that damage by an amount equal to your \glossterm{power}.
        If multiple targets take damage simultaneously, you can choose which target takes the increased damage after you know how much damage each target took,
        but before you know the results of the damage (such as whether a damaged creature became bloodied).
        % TODO: clarify what happens if multiple people try to Good aura the same target
        \subparhead{Good} When a target takes damage, you may take half that damage (rounded down) instead.
        Any abilities you have that would reduce or negate the effects of the attack have no effect.
        The protected creature takes the remaining half of the damage, and suffers any non-damaging effects of the attack normally.
        \subparhead{Law} When a target rolls a 1 on an attack roll with a \glossterm{strike}, the attack roll is treated as a 6.
        This does not affect bonus dice rolled for exploding attacks (see \pcref{Exploding Attacks}).

        \cf{Pal}[3]{Paragon Power}
        You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{power} with \glossterm{magical} abilities.

        \cf{Pal}[4]{Greater Aligned Resistance}[Magical]

        \subparhead{Evil} The damage increases to be equal to twice your \glossterm{power}.
        \subparhead{Good} When you redirect damage from a creature with this aura, you can redirect all damage from the attack to you instead of only half the damage.

        \subparhead{Law} The effect applies to all attacks, not just \glossterm{strikes}.

        \cf{Pal}[6]{Greater Paragon Power} The bonus from your \textit{paragon power} ability increases to \plus2.

        \cf{Pal}[8]{Aligned Soul}[Magical]
        While you are dead, you may approach the deity or governing figure of your afterlife and request to be returned to life to continue your mission.
        Travelling to the relevant figure and making the request takes 12 hours.
        Unless there are extenuating circumstances, this request is almost always granted, and you are resurrected in a new body at a location of the entity's choice.
        This functions like the \ritual{resurrection} ritual, except that no part of the body is required, and a new body is created by the entity.
        You can be resurrected in this way regardless of the condition of your body, but not if your soul has been trapped or otherwise prevented from going to the correct afterlife.

    \subsection{Divine Spellcasting}
        This archetype grants you the ability to cast divine spells.
        You must have a starting Willpower of at least 1 to gain this archetype.

        Your devotion to your alignment grants you the ability to use divine magic.
        You gain access to two divine \glossterm{mystic spheres} (see \pcref{Divine Mystic Spheres}).

        Divine spells require \glossterm{verbal components} to cast (see \pcref{Casting Components}).
        For details about mystic spheres and casting spells, see \pcref{Spell and Ritual Mechanics}.

        \cf{Pal}[2]{Spells} You learn two divine \glossterm{spells}.

        You can cast any \glossterm{spell} you know as a \glossterm{standard action}.
        Most spells also cost \glossterm{action points}, as indicated in their descriptions.
        When you gain access to a new \glossterm{mystic sphere} or spell level, you can exchange any number of spells you know for spells of other spells you know, including spells of the higher level.

        \cf{Pal}[3]{Spell Level}[Magical] You gain the ability to cast 2nd level divine spells.

        \cf{Pal}[1]{Zealous Power} You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{power} with \glossterm{mundane} abilities.

        \cf{Pal}[2]{Smite}[Magical] You can use the \textit{smite} ability as a standard action.
        \begin{apability}{Smite}
            Make a \glossterm{strike}.
            If your target shares your devoted alignment, the strike deals no damage.
            Otherwise, the strike gains a \plus2d bonus to damage.
        \end{apability}

        \cf{Pal}[3]{Recovering Smite} You can use the \textit{zealous recovery} ability as a standard action.
        \begin{freeability}{Recovering Smite}
            Make a \glossterm{strike} with a \minus1d penalty to damage.
            If it hits a creature that does not share your devoted alignment, you recover a spent \glossterm{recovery action point}.
        \end{freeability}

        \cf{Pal}[4]{Greater Smite}[Magical] The damage bonus from your \textit{smite} ability increases to \plus3d.
        In addition, when you use your \textit{smite} ability, you can spend an additional \glossterm{action point}.
        If you do, the target of your strike is treated as if it had the alignment opposed to your devoted alignment for the purpose of all abilities, including for your initial \textit{smite}.
        This only affects its alignment along the alignment axis your devoted alignment is on.
        For example, if your devoted alignment was evil, a chaotic neutral target would be treated as chaotic good.

        You can use this ability to do battle against foes who share your alignment, but you should exercise caution in doing so.
        Persecution of allies can lead you to fall and become an ex-paladin.

        % If you die in the service of your devoted alignment, you may choose to have your fallen body erupt in an immense burst of divine energy.
        % If you do, your body is almost completely consumed, preventing you from being raised with \ritual{resurrection} and similar effects that require an intact body.
        % This burst has two effects.
        % First, a \spell{sunburst} spell immediately takes effect over the area where you died.
        % Second, a \spell{storm of vengeance} spell begins to take effect, centered on the same area.
        % The spell lasts for 10 rounds, and the lightning strikes target the paladin's enemies.
        % Both of these effects harm only the paladin's foes, and do not harm your allies.
        % However, your allies' vision is still impeded by the \spell{storm of vengeance}.

    \subsection{Stalwart Guardian}
        This archetype grants you healing abilities and improves your defensive prowess.

        \cf{Pal}[1]{Lay on Hands}[Magical] You can use the \textit{lay on hands} ability as a standard action.
        \begin{freeability}{Lay on Hands}[Life]

            If the creature does not already hold the chosen belief, this ability automatically fails.
            \hit The target continues to maintain the chosen belief, regardless of any evidence to the contrary.
            It will interpret any evidence that the falsehood is incorrect to be somehow wrong -- an illusion, a conspiracy to decieve it, or any other reason it can think of to continue believing the falsehood.
            At the end of the effect, the creature can decide whether it believes the falsehood or not, as normal.
        \end{apability}

        \cf{Rog}[6]{Greater Confound} When you use the \textit{confound} ability, you can make the target \glossterm{stunned} instead of dazed or disoriented.

        \cf{Rog}[7]{Supreme Glibness} The bonus from your \textit{glibness} ability increases to \plus4.

    \classbasics{Alignment} Any.

    \classbasics{Archetypes} Warlocks have the Pact Spellcasting, Pact Spell Mastery, and Blessings of the Abyss \glossterm{archetypes}.

    \subsection{Basic Class Abilities}
        If you are a warlock, you gain the following abilities.

        \cf{War}{Defenses}
        You gain the following bonuses to your \glossterm{defenses}: \plus4 Fortitude, \plus3 Reflex, \plus5 Mental.

        \cf{War}{Skills}
        You have the following \glossterm{class skills}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \subparhead{Dexterity} Ride.
            \item \subparhead{Intelligence} Craft, Deduction, Disguise, Knowledge (arcana, planes, religion), Linguistics.
            \item \subparhead{Perception} Awareness, Sense Motive, Spellcraft.
            \item \subparhead{Other} Bluff, Intimidate, Persuasion, Profession.
        \end{itemize}

        \cf{War}{Weapon and Armor Proficiencies}
        You are proficient with simple weapons, any two other weapon groups, light and medium armor, and shields.
        Encumbrance from armor interferes with the gestures you make to cast spells, which can cause your spells with somatic components to fail (see \pcref{Somatic Component Failure}).

        \cf{War}{Infernal Pact}[Magical]
        To become a warlock, you must make a pact with a powerful demon or devil.
        % TODO: wording; intended to prevent Null warlocks who have no pact
        If you somehow lose this ability, you lose all other warlock abilities.
        You must make a dark sacrifice, the details of which are subject to negotiation, and offer a part of your immortal soul.
        In exchange, you gain the powers of a warlock.
        The creature you make the pact with is called your soulkeeper.

        Offering your soul to an entity in this way grants it the ability to communicate with you in limited ways.
        This communication typically manifests as unnatural emotional urges or whispered voices audible only to you.

        Your pact specifies how much of your soul is granted to your soulkeeper, and the circumstances of the transfer.
        The most common arrangement is for a soulkeeper to gain possession of your soul immediately after you die.
        It will keep the soul for one decade per year of your life that you spend as a warlock.
        During that time, it will not prevent you from being resurrected.
        At the end of that time, if your soul remains intact, your soul will pass on to its intended afterlife.
        However, other arrangements are possible, and each warlock's pact can be unique.

        The longer you spend in an afterlife that is not your own, the more likely you are to lose your sense of self and become subsumed by the plane you are on.
        Only a soul of extraordinary strength can maintain its integrity after decades or centuries in the Abyss.
        Many warlocks seek power zealously while mortal to gain the mental fortitude necessary to keep their soul after death.

        \cf{War}{Whispers of the Lost}[Magical]
        You hear the voices of souls lost to the Abyss, linked to you through your soulkeeper.
        Choose one of the following types of whispers that you hear.
        {
            \subcf{Mentoring Whispers} You hear the voice of a dead warlock whose soul is bound to the same soulkeeper as yours.

            % \subcf{Spiteful Whispers} You hear the voices of cruel souls who berate you for your flaws and mistakes.

            \subcf{Sycophantic Whispers} You hear the voices of adoring souls who praise your talents and everything you do.

            \subcf{Warning Whispers} You hear the voices of paranoid and fearful souls warning you of danger, both real and imagined.

            \subcf{Whispers of the Mighty} Your soulkeeper forges the connection to your soul into a boon granted to any soul in the Abyss strong enough to claim it in battle.
            You hear the voice of whatever soul currently possesses the boon, which may change suddenly and unexpectedly.
        }
