\chapter{Classes}\label{Classes}

Your character's class represents the things your character has chosen to train in.
This choice determines a great deal about your character's abilities.

\section{How Classes Work}
    When you first create a character, you choose a class.
    Each class grants some basic class features to all members of that class.
    In addition, each class has a number of \glossterm{archetypes} that grant more powerful and specific abilities.

    \subsection{Class-Based Power Bonuses}\label{Class-Based Power Bonuses}
        Your class gives you a bonus to your \glossterm{power} as part of its basic class abilities.
        The value of the bonus is listed in the table for each class.
        Most classes provide the same power bonus, while barbarians and warlocks have a slightly higher power bonus.

        The value of this power bonus increases as you gain ranks.
        Your rank for determining your power bonus is equal to your highest rank in any archetype from your base class.

    \subsection{Archetypes}\label{Archetypes}
        Each class has five class archetypes.
        An archetype is a collection of thematically related abilities.
        For examples, barbarians have the Battlerager archetype, which grants abilities related to being angry and flying into a rage in combat.

        You choose any three of the five archetypes from your class.
        This gives each class a broader narrative scope, and helps ensure that multiple character with the same class feel different from each other.

        \subsubsection{Archetype Ranks}\label{Archetype Ranks}
            You have an \glossterm{archetype rank} associated with each of your archetypes.
            Each ability from an archetype has a minimum rank required to gain the ability.
            When you gain a rank in an archetype, you gain all abilities associated with that rank.
            In addition, some of your existing abilities may increase their power based on your rank in that archetype.

            At 1st level, you choose three of the archetypes associated with your class.
            You are Rank 1 in one of those archetypes, and rank 0 in your other two archetypes.
            You have no ranks at all in any other archetypes, and can never gain abilities from archetypes other than your chosen three.

            Every level after 1st level, you increase your rank in one archetype of your choice.
            This gives you the abilities associated with that rank.
            Each \glossterm{archetype rank} has a minimum level, as shown on \trefnp{Archetype Ranks by Level}.
            This minimum level is included in each class table as a reminder.

            \begin{dtable}
                \lcaption{Archetype Ranks by Level}
                \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{l >{\lcol}X}
                    \tb{Archetype Rank} & \tb{Minimum Level} \tableheaderrule
                    1 & 1  \\
                    2 & 4  \\
                    3 & 7  \\
                    4 & 10 \\
                    5 & 13 \\
                    6 & 16 \\
                    7 & 19 \\
                \end{dtabularx}
            \end{dtable}

        \subsubsection{Duplicate Archetypes}\label{Duplicate Archetypes}
            Some archetypes can be gained by multiple classes.
            For example, both clerics and paladins have the Divine Magic archetype.
            You cannot gain two archetypes with the same name, even if you can choose archetypes from multiple classes.

        \subsection{Multiclass Characters}\label{Multiclass Characters}
            You can spend two \glossterm{insight points} to become a \glossterm{multiclass} character (see \pcref{Insight Points}).
            If you do, choose a class other than your original class.
            You gain the following benefits relating to that class.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item You gain the \glossterm{class skills} of that class in addition to your existing \glossterm{class skills}.
                \item You can choose which of your classes you are considered for the purpose of determining your basic class abilities, such as proficiencies and defense bonuses.
                    You must choose a single starting class for this purpose, so you cannot gain the power from one class and the weapon proficiencies from another.
                \item If that class has any special class abilities which are not part of an archetype, such as a warlock's \textit{soul pact} ability, you gain those abilities.
                \item You may replace any number of \glossterm{archetypes} from your original class with that many archetypes from your new class.
            \end{itemize}

            You may gain access to multiple classes in this way, spending two \glossterm{insight points} for each class.
            Unless your GM says otherwise, you can only become a multiclass character as part of initial character creation.
            Changing a higher level character character into a multiclass character can be a major change that requires losing access to abilities that you have already had for some time.
            Generally, you should have an explicit narrative justification for a major character change like that.
            Of course, every game is different, so talk to your GM.
