\chapter{Classes}\label{Classes}

Your character's class represents the things your character has chosen to train in.
This choice determines a great deal about your character's abilities.

\section{How Classes Work}
    When you first create a character, you choose a class.
    Each class grants some basic class features to all members of that class.
    In addition, each class has a number of \glossterm{archetypes} that grant more powerful and specific abilities.

    \subsection{Archetypes}\label{Archetypes}
        Each class has a number of \glossterm{archetypes}.
        An archetype is a collection of thematically related abilities.
        For examples, barbarians have the Battlerager archetype, which grants abilities related to being angry and flying into a rage in combat.
        You have an \glossterm{archetype rank} associated with each archetype you have.

        \subsubsection{Archetype Ranks}\label{Archetype Ranks}
            Each ability from an archetype has a minimum rank required to gain the ability.
            When you gain a rank in an archetype, you gain all abilities associated with that rank.
            In addition, some of your existing abilities may increase their power based on your rank in that archetype.

            At 1st level, you choose three of the archetypes associated with your class.
            You are Rank 1 in one of those archetypes, and rank 0 in your other two archetypes.
            You have no ranks at all in any other archetypes, and can never gain abilities from archetypes other than your chosen three.

            Every level after 1st level, you increase your rank in one archetype of your choice.
            This gives you the abilities associated with that rank.
            Each \glossterm{archetype rank} has a minimum level, as shown on \trefnp{Archetype Ranks by Level}.
            This minimum level is included in each class table as a reminder.

            \begin{dtable}
                \lcaption{Archetype Ranks by Level}
                \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{l >{\lcol}X}
                    \tb{Archetype Rank} & \tb{Minimum Level} \tableheaderrule
                    1 & 1  \\
                    2 & 4  \\
                    3 & 7  \\
                    4 & 10 \\
                    5 & 13 \\
                    6 & 16 \\
                    7 & 19 \\
                \end{dtabularx}
            \end{dtable}

        \subsubsection{Duplicate Archetypes}\label{Duplicate Archetypes}
            Some archetypes can be gained by multiple classes.
            For example, both clerics and paladins have the Divine Magic archetype.
            You cannot gain two archetypes with the same name, even if you can choose archetypes from multiple classes.

        \subsection{Multiclass Characters}\label{Multiclass Characters}
            You can spend two \glossterm{insight points} to become a \glossterm{multiclass} character (see \pcref{Insight Points}).
            If you do, choose a class other than your base class.
            You gain the following benefits relating to that class.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item You gain the \glossterm{class skills} of that class in addition to your existing \glossterm{class skills}.
                \item You can exchange any number of your basic class abilities, such as weapon proficiencies, for the corresponding abilities of that class.
                \item If that class has any class abilities which are not part of an archetype, such as a druid's \textit{metal abhorrence} ability, you gain those abilities.
                \item You may gain one \glossterm{archetype} from your that class in place of one \glossterm{archetype} from your base class.
            \end{itemize}

            You may gain access to multiple classes in this way, spending two \glossterm{insight points} for each class.

    Barbarians are primal warriors that draw power from the physical strength of their bodies.
    A typical barbarian is strong, fast, and durable - and a terrifying threat for their unfortunate enemies to behold.
    They are more inclined to chaos than law, and often have little respect for civilized society, though they may respect authorities with the power to back up their claims.
    They tend to forgo defense in favor of offense, trusting their physical durability to keep them in the fight.
    Barbarians have limited utility outside of combat, though their physical prowess often gives them high physical skills.

    Clerics are divine spellcasters that draw power from their worship of a specific deity.
    Divine magic tends to be more subtle than other forms of magic, and focuses more on aiding yourself and allies than destroy foes with flashy bursts.
    A cleric's deity often grants them influence over specific aspects of the world that the deity has purview over, aligning the cleric's power more closely with that of the deity.

                The creature is able to refuse to speak with you, though you can attempt to persuade it to speak normally, and some creatures may be more willing to talk if they know they are already dead.
                The corpse must have an intact mouth to be able to speak.
                This ability ends if 24 hours have passed since the creature died.
            \end{attuneability}
            \parhead{Mastery} Whenever you inflict a \glossterm{vital wound} on a living creature, you may cause that creature to immediately die.

        \subsubsection{Destruction}
            % This ability gets rank upgrades while maneuvers don't
            % because maneuvers are upgraded into higher rank maneuvers,
            % while this has no upgrades and should remain relevant alone.
            \parhead{Gift} You can use the \textit{destructive attack} ability as a standard action.
            \begin{freeability}{Destructive Attack}
                Make a \glossterm{strike} with a \minus2 penalty to \glossterm{accuracy}.
                You gain a \plus2d bonus damage with the strike.

                \rankline
                \rank{3} The damage bonus increases to \plus3d.
                \rank{5} The damage bonus increases to \plus4d.

                \hit For each target, if its \glossterm{resistance} against \glossterm{physical damage} is lower than your \glossterm{power}, it crumbles into a fine power and is irreparably \glossterm{destroyed}.

                \rankline
                \rank{6} The area increases to a \arealarge radius.

        \subsubsection{Evil}
            \parhead{Gift} At the start of each phase, you may choose an adjacent \glossterm{ally}.
            If you do, the first time you would lose a \glossterm{hit point} that phase, the target loses that hit point instead.
            If the target is unable to lose hit points, such as if it has no hit points remaining, you suffer the hit point loss normally.
            \parhead{Aspect} You can use this domain's domain gift to target any \glossterm{ally} within \rngmed range.
            \parhead{Essence} You can use the \textit{compel evil} ability as a standard action.
            \begin{freeability}{Compel Evil}[\glossterm{Compulsion}]
                Make an attack vs. Mental against a creature within \rngmed range.
                Creatures who have strict codes prohibiting them from taking evil actions, such as paladins devoted to Good, are immune to this ability.
                \hit The target takes an evil action as soon as it can.
                You have no control over the act the creature takes, but circumstances can make the target more likely to take an action you desire.
                \glance As above, except that the effect ends at the end of the next round.

                \rankline
                You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with the attack for each rank beyond 4.
            \end{freeability}
            \parhead{Mastery} You can use your domain gift to redirect your hit point loss to an adjacent unwilling creature.
            You cannot target the same unwilling creature more than once with this ability between \glossterm{short rests}.

            If you choose this domain, you add the \sphere{pyromancy} \glossterm{mystic sphere} to your list of divine mystic spheres (see \pcref{Mystic Spheres}).

            \parhead{Gift} You gain a bonus equal to twice your rank in this archetype to your \glossterm{resistance} against fire damage.
            \parhead{Aspect} Your abilities cannot deal fire damage to your \glossterm{allies}.
            \parhead{Essence} You can use the \textit{speak with fire} ability as a standard action.

                You can speak with and command fire within a \areahuge radius \glossterm{zone} from your location.
                You can ask the fire simple questions and understand its responses.
                If you command the fire to perform a task, it will do so do the best of its ability until this effect ends.
                You cannot compel the fire to move farther than 30 feet in a single round.
                Fire that ends the round on non-combustable materials usually goes out, depending on the circumstances.

                After you use this ability on a particular area of fire, you cannot use it again on that same area for 24 hours.
                % TODO: What does an ``area of fire'' mean?

                \rankline
                \rank{6} The area increases to a \areagarg radius.
            \end{attuneability}
            \parhead{Mastery} Whenever you deal fire damage, you also treat that damage as being pure energy damage.
            This can help you deal damage to enemies that are highly resistant to fire damage.
            In addition, you become immune to fire damage.

        \subsubsection{Good}
            \parhead{Gift} Whenever an adjacent \glossterm{ally} suffers a \glossterm{vital wound}, you may gain a \glossterm{vital wound} instead.
            You gain a \plus2 bonus to the \glossterm{vital roll} of each \glossterm{vital wound} you gain this way.
            The original target suffers any other effects of the attack normally.
            \parhead{Aspect} This domain's domain gift affects any \glossterm{ally} within a \areamed radius \glossterm{emanation} from you.
            \parhead{Essence} You can use the \textit{compel good} ability as a standard action.
            \begin{freeability}{Compel Good}[\glossterm{Compulsion}]

                Creatures who have strict codes prohibiting them from taking evil actions, such as paladins devoted to Good, are immune to this ability.
                \hit The target takes an good action as soon as it can.
                You have no control over the act the creature takes, but circumstances can make the target more likely to take an action you desire.
                \glance As above, except that the effect ends at the end of the next round.

                \rankline
                You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with the attack for each rank beyond 4.
            \end{freeability}
            \parhead{Mastery} Once per round, when an \glossterm{ally} within a \areamed radius \glossterm{emanation} from you would lose \glossterm{hit points}, you may lose those hit points instead.
            The target suffers any other effects of the attack normally, though it is not treated as if it lost hit points from the attack for the purpose of special attack effects.

        \subsubsection{Knowledge}
            If you choose this domain, you add all Knowledge skills to your cleric \glossterm{class skill} list.

            \parhead{Gift} You gain two skill points.

            \parhead{Essence} You can use the \textit{share knowledge} ability as a standard action.
            \begin{freeability}{Share Knowledge}
                You make a Knowledge check of any kind.
                You and your \glossterm{allies} within a \arealarge radius learn the results of your check.
                Creatures believe the information gained in this way to be true as if they it had seen it with their own eyes.

                You cannot alter the knowledge you gain with this check in any way, such as by adding or withholding information.

                \rankline
                \rank{6} You gain a \plus3 bonus to the Knowledge check.
            \end{freeability}
            \parhead{Mastery} You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with all attacks.
            In addition, you can use your \textit{share knowledge} ability to affect all creatures, not just your allies.

            \parhead{Gift} You gain a \plus2 bonus to Mental defense.
            % Clarify - does this apply to exploding dice?
            \parhead{Aspect} When you roll a 1 on an \glossterm{attack roll}, it is treated as if you had rolled a 6.
            \parhead{Essence} You can use the \textit{compel law} ability as a standard action.
            \begin{freeability}{Compel Law}[\glossterm{Compulsion}]

                \hit Each target is unable to break the laws that apply in the area, and any attempt to do so simply fails.
                The laws which are applied are those which are most appropriate for the area, regardless of whether you or any other creature know those laws.

                % Sufficiently clear that this isn't part of the hit effect?
                When you use this ability, you also gain the condition.
                If this condition is removed from you, it is also removed from all other affected creatures.
                In areas under ambiguous or nonexistent government, this ability may have unexpected effects, or it may have no effect at all.
                \glance As above, except that the effect ends at the end of the next round.

                \rankline
                You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with the attack for each rank beyond 4.
            \end{freeability}
            % on average, slightly better than +1 accuracy
            \parhead{Mastery} When you roll less than a 6 on an \glossterm{attack roll}, it is treated as if you had rolled a 6.

            \parhead{Essence} At the end of each round, if you became \glossterm{unconscious} from a \glossterm{vital wound} that round, you can use one \glossterm{magical} ability you have that modifies \glossterm{vital rolls} or removes \glossterm{vital wounds} on yourself without taking an action.
            \parhead{Mastery} You gain a \plus1 bonus to your base Constitution.

        \subsubsection{Magic}

            \begin{freeability}{Dimensional Travel}[\glossterm{Teleportation}]
                You teleport up to 1 mile in any direction.
                You do not need \glossterm{line of sight} or \glossterm{line of effect} to your destination, but you must be able to clearly visualize it.

                \rankline
                \rank{6} The maximum distance increases to 5 miles.
            \end{freeability}
            \parhead{Mastery} When you would move, you can teleport the same distance instead.
            This does not change the total distance you can move, but you can teleport in any direction, including vertically.
            Being \glossterm{grappled} or otherwise physically constrained does not prevent you from teleporting in this way.

            You can even attempt to move to locations outside of \glossterm{line of sight} and \glossterm{line of effect}, up to the limit of your remaining movement speed.
            If your intended destination is invalid, the distance you tried to teleport is taken from your remaining movement, but you suffer no other ill effects.

        \subsubsection{Trickery}

                Make an attack vs. Mental against a creature within \rngmed range.
                You must also choose a belief that the target has.
                The belief may be a lie that you told it, or even a simple misunderstanding (such as believing a hidden creature is not present in a room).
                If the creature does not already hold the chosen belief, this ability automatically fails.
                \hit The target continues to maintain the chosen belief, regardless of any evidence to the contrary.
                It will interpret any evidence that the falsehood is incorrect to be somehow wrong -- an illusion, a conspiracy to decieve it, or any other reason it can think of to continue believing the falsehood.
                At the end of the effect, the creature can decide whether it believes the falsehood or not, as normal.
                \glance As above, except that the effect ends at the end of the next round.

                \rankline
                You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with the attack for each rank beyond 4.
            \end{freeability}
            % This seems like it's a complicated muddle of weird and possibly hilarious edge cases
            \parhead{Mastery} You are undetectable to all \glossterm{magical} abilities.
            They cannot detect your presence, sounds you make, or any actions you take.
            For example, a scrying sensor created by a \glossterm{Scrying} effect would be unable to detect your presence, and a creature with magical \glossterm{darkvision} would not be able to see you without light.

        \subsubsection{War}
            \parhead{Gift} You gain proficiency with heavy armor and an additional \glossterm{weapon group} of your choice.
            \parhead{Aspect} You deal half damage to your allies with \glossterm{magical} abilities.
            \parhead{Essence} Whenever you miss by 2 or less with a \glossterm{strike}, the target takes half damage from the strike.
            This is called a \glossterm{glancing blow}.
            \parhead{Mastery} You gain a \plus4 bonus to your \glossterm{power} with all abilities.

        \subsubsection{Water}
            If you choose this domain, you add the \sphere{aquamancy} \glossterm{mystic sphere} to your list of divine mystic spheres (see \pcref{Mystic Spheres}).

            \parhead{Gift} You gain a \plus2 bonus to the Flexibility and Swim skills.
            \parhead{Aspect} You can breathe water as easily as a human breathes air, preventing you from drowning or suffocating underwater.
            \parhead{Essence} You can use the \textit{speak with water} ability as a standard action.
            \begin{attuneability}{Speak with Water}[\glossterm{Attune} (self)]
                You can speak with and command water within a \areahuge \glossterm{zone} from your location.
                You can ask the water simple questions and understand its responses.
                If you command the water to perform a task, it will do so do the best of its ability until this effect ends.
                You cannot compel the water to move faster than 30 feet per round.

                After you use this ability on a particular area of water, you cannot use it again on that same area for 24 hours.

                \rankline
                \rank{6} The area increases to a \areagarg radius.
            \end{attuneability}
            \parhead{Mastery} Your body becomes partially aquatic, allowing you to manipulate it more easily.
            The bonuses from this domain's gift increase to \plus10.
            In addition, you gain a \plus1 bonus to Armor and Reflex defenses.

        \subsubsection{Wild}
            If you choose this domain, you add the \sphere{verdamancy} \glossterm{mystic sphere} to your list of divine mystic spheres (see \pcref{Mystic Spheres}).
            In addition, you add the Creature Handling, Knowledge (nature), and Survival skills to your cleric \glossterm{class skill} list.

            \parhead{Gift} You gain two skill points.
            % TODO: clarify whether you can have this and the druid ability
            \parhead{Aspect} This ability functions like the \textit{wild aspect} druid ability from the Shifter archetype (see \pcref{Shifter}), except that you cannot spend \glossterm{insight points} to learn additional wild aspects.
            \parhead{Essence} You learn an additional \textit{wild aspect}.
            \parhead{Mastery} You can maintain both of your wild aspects simultaneously.

        \subsubsection{Ex-Clerics}
            If you grossly violate the code of conduct required by your deity, you lose all spells and magical cleric class abilities.
            You cannot regain those abilities until you atone for your transgressions to your deity.

    Druids are nature spellcasters that draw power from their veneration of the natural world.
    Nature magic can be used to help allies or to crush foes with natural elements like air or fire.
    Many druids live outside of organized society, either on their own or in small communes with other druids and similarly minded people.
    Druids have strong ties to the natural world with a variety of abilities other than their spells.
    They can speak with and command animals or elements, or even change their body to take on on aspects of animals themselves.

    \newpage
    \subsection{Elementalist}\label{Elementalist}
        This archetype grants you influence over four elements that define the natural world: air, earth, fire, and water.

        \cf{Drd}[0]{Elemental Lore} You gain two skill points.

        \cf{Drd}[1]{Elemental Balance} You gain a small benefit from each of the four elements.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Air: You gain a \plus2 bonus to the Jump skill.
            \item Earth: You gain a \plus1 bonus to Fortitude defense.
            \item Fire: You gain a bonus equal to twice your rank in this archetype to your \glossterm{resistance} against fire damage.
            \item Water: You gain a \plus2 bonus to the Swim skill.
        \end{itemize}

        \cf{Drd}[2]{Elemental Magic} Choose one of the \glossterm{mystic spheres} associated with the four elements: \sphere{aeromancy}, \sphere{aquamancy}, \sphere{pyromancy}, or \sphere{terramancy}.
        If you already have access to that mystic sphere, you learn two spells from that sphere.
        Otherwise, you gain access to that mystic sphere, including all \glossterm{cantrips} from that sphere.

        \cf{Drd}[3]{Elemental Influence} You can use the \textit{elemental influence} ability as a standard action.
        \begin{freeability}{Elemental Influence}[\glossterm{Sustain} (standard)]
            You can speak with air, earth, fire, and water within a \areahuge \glossterm{zone} from your location.
            You can ask the elements simple questions and understand their responses.
            Air, earth, and water are only able to give information about what they touch.
            This includes the general shapes, sizes, and locations of creatures and objects they interacted with, but not any details about color or subjective appearance.
            Fire is also able to give information about anything illuminated by its light, allowing it to report more detailed information like color.
            It is still unable to make meaningful subjective judgments like a creature would.
            Each element has different limitations on its memory and awareness, as described below.

            \begin{itemize}
                \item Air: Air can remember events up to an hour ago on a very calm day or only a few minutes ago on a windy day.
                    Moving air is aware of events near where it blew through, not necessarily in your current location.
                \item Earth: Earth can remember events up to a year ago, but its awareness is extremely limited.
                    It can only remember very large events, such as giant creatures tearing up the terrain, earthquakes, or major construction.
                    Earth can tell you whether there exist underground tunnels within the area, but any sort of detailed mapping is beyond its ability to communicate.
                \item Fire: Fire can remember everything it touched and consumed since it started burning.
                    Individual pieces of a very large fire, such as a particular burning tree in a forest fire, are not aware of the behavior of the entirety of the fire.
                    However, the fire on burning tree could tell you how it got to the tree and everything it burned along the way, including the event that started the forest fire.
                \item Water: Water can remember events up to a day ago in a very calm pool or only a few minutes ago in a turbulent river.
                    Moving water is aware of events near where it moved through, not necessarily in your current location.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{freeability}

        \cf{Drd}[4]{Greater Elemental Balance} The bonuses from your \textit{elemental balance} ability improve.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Air: You gain a \glossterm{glide speed} equal to your \glossterm{base speed}.
            \item Earth: The bonus to Fortitude defense increases to \plus2.
            \item Fire: The bonus to your \glossterm{resistance} increases to be equal to three times your rank in this archetype.
            \item Water: You gain a \glossterm{swim speed} equal to your \glossterm{base speed}.
        \end{itemize}

        % Should this give two spells or another side benefit?
        \cf{Drd}[5]{Elemental Spell} You learn an additional spell from any of the spheres associated with the four elements: \sphere{aeromancy}, \sphere{aquamancy}, \sphere{pyromancy}, or \sphere{terramancy}.

        % This should probably be granted before rank 6
        \cf{Drd}[6]{Elemental Control} When you use your \textit{elemental influence} ability, you can also command the elements to move as you desire.
        Each element has different limitations on its ability to move, as described below.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Air: You can change the wind speed of air by up to 50 miles per hour.
                If you reduce the air's speed to 0 and then increase it again, you can change the direction the air blows.
            \item Earth: You can reshape earth or unworked stone at a rate of up to one foot per round.
            \item Fire: You can make fire leap up to 30 feet between combustable materials, suppress fire so it smolders without being extinguished, or snuff out fire entirely.
            \item Water: You can change the speed of water by up to 30 feet per round.
                If you reduce the water's speed to 0 and then increase it again, you can change the direction the water flows.
        \end{itemize}

        \cf{Drd}[7]{Supreme Elemental Balance} The bonuses from your \textit{elemental balance} ability improve.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Air: You gain a \glossterm{fly speed} equal to your \glossterm{base speed} with a maximum height of 60 feet (see \pcref{Flying}).
            At the start of each phase, you can gain a \glossterm{fatigue point} to ignore this height limit until the end of the round.
            \item Earth: The bonus to Fortitude defense increases to \plus3.
            \item Fire: The bonus to your \glossterm{resistance} increases to be equal to four times your rank in this archetype.
            \item Water: You suffer no penalties for fighting underwater, and you can breathe water as if it was air.
        \end{itemize}

        You automatically learn all \glossterm{cantrips} from any mystic sphere you have access to.
        You do not yet gain access to any other spells from those mystic spheres.

        \cf{Drd}[1]{Spellcasting}[Magical]
        You become a rank 1 nature spellcaster.
        You learn two rank 1 \glossterm{spells} from nature \glossterm{mystic spheres} you have access to.
        You can also spend \glossterm{insight points} to learn one additional rank 1 spell per \glossterm{insight point}.
        Unless otherwise noted in a spell's description, casting a spell requires a \glossterm{standard action}.

        When you gain access to a new \glossterm{mystic sphere} or spell \glossterm{rank},
            you can forget any number of spells you know to learn that many new spells in exchange,
            including spells of the higher rank.

        You can also spend \glossterm{insight points} to learn one additional \textit{wild aspect} per \glossterm{insight point}.

        As a \glossterm{standard action}, you can gain the effects of one wild aspect that you know.
        That effect lasts until you activate a different wild aspect you know or until you dismiss it as a \glossterm{free action}.

        The abilities in the list below describe the effects of the aspect.
        Your appearance also changes to match the aspect's effects, but the nature of this change is not described.
        Different druids change in different ways.
        For example, one druid might grow brown fur when using the Form of the Bear, while another might instead change their face to become broader and more bear-shaped when embodying the same aspect.
        You choose how your appearance changes when you gain a wild aspect.
        This change cannot be used to gain an additional substantive benefit beyond the effects given in the description of the aspect.

    \subsection{Wildspeaker}\label{Wildspeaker}

        \cf{Drd}[0]{Nature's Ally} Wild animals will not willingly attack you.
        They can be compelled to attack you with a Creature Handling check with a \glossterm{difficulty rating} equal to 10 \add twice your rank in this archetype.
        If you attack a creature you are protected from, this ability no longer provides protection against it and its \glossterm{allies}.
        This effect does not protect your allies from attack, though it may give you time to make Creature Handling checks to avoid the attack.

        \cf{Drd}[1]{Natural Servant}[Magical]
        You can use the \textit{natural servant} ability.
        This ability requires spending 1 hour performing rituals in a natural area.
        \begin{attuneability}{Natural Servant}[\glossterm{Attune} (self), \glossterm{Magical}]
            An animal native to the local environment appears to help you.
            It follows your directions to the best of its ability as long as you remain in its natural environment.
            Animals are unable to understand complex concepts, so their ability to obey convoluted instructions is limited.
            If you leave the animal's natural habitat, it remains behind and this effect ends.
            If the animal gains a \glossterm{vital wound} or has no hit points remaining at the end of the round, this effect ends.

            Your magical connection to the animal improves its resilience and strength in combat.
            The animal's statistics use the values below, except that each animal also gains a special ability based on the environment you are in.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Its \glossterm{fatigue tolerance} is 1.
                \item Its \glossterm{hit points} are equal to the base value for your level (see \tref{Character Advancement}).
                \item Its \glossterm{resistances} are equal to the base value for your level (see \pcref{Character Advancement}).
                \item Each of its \glossterm{defenses} is equal to 5 \add your level.
                \item Its \glossterm{accuracy} is equal to your level \add half your base Perception \add your \glossterm{magic bonuses} to accuracy.
                \item Its \glossterm{power} with its attacks is equal to your \glossterm{power} \sub 2.
                \item Its \glossterm{base speed} is the normal base speed for its size (see \tref{Size in Combat}).
                \item It has no \glossterm{attunement points}.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{attuneability}

        The special ability of the animal that appears depends on your environment, as described below.
        You may choose a different animal native to that environment that is similar in size and type, but that does not change the animal's statistics.
        For example, your \textit{natural servant} in an aquatic environment may be a fish or seal instead of a shark.
        Unusual environments may have different animals than the standard animals listed below.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Aquatic: A Small shark appears that has a 30 foot \glossterm{swim speed} and no land speed.
                It has a bite \glossterm{natural weapon}.
            \item Arctic: An Small arctic fox appears that has no penalties for being in cold environments.
                It has a bite \glossterm{natural weapon}.
            \item Desert: A Small hyena appears that has no penalties for being in hot environments.
                It has a bite \glossterm{natural weapon}.
            \item Mountain: A Small goat appears that can move up or down steep slopes without slowing its movement.
                It has a ram \glossterm{natural weapon}.
            \item Forest: A Small wolverine appears that has two additional \glossterm{hit points}.
                It has a bite \glossterm{natural weapon}.
            \item Plains: A Small wolf appears that has the \glossterm{scent} ability.
                It has a bite \glossterm{natural weapon}.
            \item Swamp: A Small crocodile appears that has a 15 foot \glossterm{land speed} and a 25 foot \glossterm{swim speed}.
                It has a bite \glossterm{natural weapon}.
            \item Underground: A Small dire rat appears that has \glossterm{low-light vision}.
                It has a bite \glossterm{natural weapon}.
        \end{itemize}

        \cf{Drd}[2]{Animal Speech}[Magical] You can use the \textit{animal speech} ability as a standard action.
        \begin{attuneability}{Animal Speech}[\glossterm{Sustain} (minor)]
            Choose an animal within \rnglong range.
            You can speak to and understand the speech of the target animal, and any other animals of the same species.

            This ability does not make the target any more friendly or cooperative than normal.
            Wary and cunning animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while stupid ones tend to make inane comments and are unlikely to say or understand anything of use.
        \end{attuneability}

        \cf{Drd}[3]{Greater Nature's Ally}[Magical] Your \glossterm{allies} within a \arealarge radius \glossterm{emanation} from you also gain the benefit of your \textit{nature's ally} ability.
        The protection ends if any target attacks a creature you are protected from instead of only if you attack.
        In addition, the \glossterm{difficulty rating} of the Creature Handling check increases to 20 \add twice your rank in this archetype.

        \cf{Drd}[4]{Greater Natural Servant}[Magical] Your \textit{natural servant} gains an \glossterm{attunement point}.
        This attunement point is shared among any creatures you summon with your \textit{natural servant} ability, and is only recovered when you take a \glossterm{long rest}.
        In addition, you can summon an alternate \textit{natural servant} based on your local environment, as described below.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Aquatic: A Medium shark appears that has a 40 foot \glossterm{swim speed} and no land speed.
                It has a bite \glossterm{natural weapon}.
            \item Arctic: An Medium polar bear appears that has a bonus equal to twice your rank in this archetype to its \glossterm{resistance} against cold damage.
                It has a bite \glossterm{natural weapon} and two claw \glossterm{natural weapons}.
            \item Desert: A Medium camel appears that has no penalties for being in hot environments.
                It has a bite \glossterm{natural weapon}.
            \item Mountain: A Medium goat appears that can move up or down steep slopes without slowing its movement.
                It has a ram \glossterm{natural weapon}.
            \item Forest: A Medium bear appears that has four additional \glossterm{hit points}.
                It has a bite \glossterm{natural weapon} and two claw \glossterm{natural weapons}.
            \item Plains: A Medium wolf appears that has the \glossterm{scent} ability.
                It has a bite \glossterm{natural weapon}.
            % TODO: define shallow water
            \item Swamp: A Medium crocodile appears that has a 20 foot \glossterm{land speed} and a 30 foot \glossterm{swim speed}.
                It has a bite \glossterm{natural weapon}.
            \item Underground: A Medium dire rat appears that has \glossterm{low-light vision} and \glossterm{darkvision}.
                It has a bite \glossterm{natural weapon}.
        \end{itemize}

        \cf{Drd}[5]{Plant Speech}[Magical] When you use your \textit{animal speech} ability, you can target a plant instead of an animal.
        When you do, you can speak to and understand the speech of the target plant, and any other plants of the same species.

        \cf{Drd}[6]{Supreme Nature's Ally}[Magical] Your \textit{nature's ally} ability also protects you and your allies from plant creatures and elementals.
        In addition, all creatures that you are protected from with this ability automatically attempt to aid you and your allies if they observe you fighting.
        Finally, the effect can no longer be bypassed with a Creature Handling check or any other form of control that does not first suppress this effect.
        Even creatures summoned by enemies to fight you will immediately turn on their summoners.

        \cf{Drd}[7]{Supreme Natural Servant}[Magical] Your \textit{natural servant} gains two additional \glossterm{attunement points}.

        % \subcf{17th -- Water's Flow}
        % As a minor action, the druid can transform herself into a rushing flow of water with a volume roughly equal to your normal volume until the end of your turn.
        % In this form, she may move wherever water could go, but she cannot take other actions, such as jumping, attacking, or casting spells.
        % Your speed is halved when moving uphill and doubled when moving downhill.
        % She may move through squares occupied by enemies without penalty.
        % She may return to your normal form as a free action.
        % \par If the water is split, she may reform from anywhere the water has reached, to as little as a single ounce of water.
        % If not even an ounce of water exists contiguously, your body reforms from the largest available parts of water, cut into pieces of appropriate size.
        % This usually causes the druid to die.

    \subsection{Ex-Druids}
        A druid who ceases to revere nature or who changes to a prohibited alignment loses all magical druid class abilities.
        They cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until they atone for their transgressions.

        %     \subsubsection{Blighter}

        %         Blighters draw power from nature, as do other druids. However, while other druids revere nature and draw power from it gently, blighters steal power from nature forcefully. Wherever a blighter goes, destruction and death surely follows.

        %         \altcf{Blight} Instead of meditating to regain spell slots, a blighter draws power from your environment forcefully.
        %         This affects a \arealarge radius zone centered on your, and the process takes 1 minute of concentration.
        %         At the end of every round, every living thing in the area other than the blighter takes damage equal to your nature power.
        %         All inanimate plants of Huge size or smaller immediately wither and die.

        % \subsubsection{Rotbringer}

        %     While most druids seek to emulate and interact with animals, rotbringers focus on the power of fungi, decay, and regeneration.

        %     \altcf{Invoke Rot} Instead of meditating to regain spell slots, a rotbringer accelerates the natural forces of decomposition and decay on your environment.
        %     This affects a \arealarge radius zone centered on your, and the process takes 1 minute of concentration.
        %     All organic objects of Huge size or smaller, such as plants and corpses, decompose.
        %     This decomposition kills inanimate, living plants.
        %     All organic objects, regardless of size, are covered with various fungi.
        %     This ability has no effect on artificial environments or materials, such as metal or worked stone.
        %     At the end of the minute, the rotbringer regains your spent nature spell slots.

        %     This extra spell slot lasts until it is used, or until you regain your spell slots again.

        %     A rotbringer can only invoke rot on your surroundings in this way once per hour.
        %     If your surroundings are already decomposed or are not natural terrain, she cannot use this ability to regain your spells.
        %     Instead, she must meditate for 8 hours to slowly draw power from your surroundings, as a normal druid.

        %     \altcf[2]{Wild Speech} The rotbringer gains the ability to speak with plants at 2nd level.
        %     You gain the ability to speak with animals at 6th level, instead of at 2nd level.

        %     \altcf[3rd]{Wild Aspect} The rotbringer does not gain this ability.

        %     \altcf[3rd]{Rot Spell} The druid learns an additional spell slot and spell known.
        %     The spell must be taken from the following list of spells.
        %     The spell's level cannot exceed half your druid level.
        %     If she already knows a spell from the list at every spell level you ha access to, she may instead learn any nature spell (see \pcref{Nature Spells}).

        %     At 5th level, and every odd level, the druid may learn a new spell.

    Monks are agile warriors that use intensive training to move beyond the limits of their physical bodies.

        This archetype improves your combat prowess with unusual abilities you can use in combat.

        \cf{Mnk}[0]{Esoteric Fluidity} You gain a \plus1 bonus to Dexterity-based \glossterm{checks}, except \glossterm{initiative} checks.

        {

            As a \glossterm{standard action}, you can use any \glossterm{maneuver} you know.

            When you gain access to a new \glossterm{rank} in this archetype,
                you can exchange any number of maneuvers you know for other maneuvers,
                including maneuvers of the higher rank.
        }

        {
            \cf{Mnk}[2]{Maneuver Rank} You become a rank 2 esoteric maneuverist.

        }

            This is called a \glossterm{glancing blow}.
        }

        {
            \cf*{Mnk}[4]{Maneuver Rank} You become a rank 4 esoteric maneuverist.

    \subsection{Ki}
        This archtype grants you unusual abilities based on tapping into your inner ki.
        If you have any \glossterm{encumbrance}, you lose the benefit of all abilities from this archetype.

        \cf{Mnk}[0]{Ki Barrier}[Magical]
        If you are not wearing armor, you gain a ki barrier around your body.
        This functions like body armor that provides a \plus2 bonus to Armor defense and has no \glossterm{encumbrance}.
        It also provides a \plus4 bonus to \glossterm{resistance} against \glossterm{energy damage}, and a \plus2 bonus to \glossterm{resistance} against \glossterm{physical damage}.
        The armor has no \glossterm{encumbrance}.

        As long as you have a free hand, the barrier also manifests as a shield that provides a \plus1 bonus to Armor defense.
        This bonus is considered to come from a shield, and does not stack with the benefits of using a physical shield.

        \cf{Mnk}[1]{Ki Manifestations}[Magical]
        You can channel your ki to temporarily enhance your abilities.
        Choose one \textit{ki manifestation} from the list below.
        You can also spend \glossterm{insight points} to learn one additional \textit{ki manifestation} per \glossterm{insight point}.
        You can use any \textit{ki manifestation} ability you know using the type of action indicated in the ability's description.

        After you use a \textit{ki manifestation}, you cannot use a \textit{ki manifestation} until after the end of the next round.

                You can use this ability as part of movement.
                % TODO: is 'horizontally' the correct word?
                You teleport horizontally instead of moving normally.
                If your \glossterm{line of effect} to your destination is blocked, or if this teleportation would somehow place you inside a solid object, your teleportation is cancelled and you remain where you are.

                Teleporting a given distance costs movement equal to twice that distance.
                For example, if you have a 30 foot movement speed, you can move 10 feet, teleport 5 feet, and move an additional 10 feet before your movement ends.

                \rank{7} You can attempt to teleport to locations outside of \glossterm{line of sight} and \glossterm{line of effect}.
                If your intended destination is invalid, the distance you spent teleporting is wasted, but you suffer no other ill effects.

        % You are resurrected in a new body at a location of the entity's choice, which is usually a place of power for the entity.
        % This functions like the \ritual{resurrection} ritual, except that no part of the body is required, and a new body is created by the entity.

        This archetype grants you the ability to cast divine spells.

        You can also spend \glossterm{insight points} to learn one additional rank 1 spell per \glossterm{insight point}.
        Unless otherwise noted in a spell's description, casting a spell requires a \glossterm{standard action}.

        When you gain access to a new \glossterm{mystic sphere} or spell \glossterm{rank},
            you can forget any number of spells you know to learn that many new spells in exchange,
            including spells of the higher rank.

        \begin{freeability}{Lay on Hands}
            \target{Yourself or a living \glossterm{ally} within \glossterm{reach}}
            The target regains \glossterm{hit points} equal to 1d6 plus half your \glossterm{power}.

            \rankline

        In addition, the bonus from your \textit{greater enduring defender} ability increases to \plus2.

        \cf{Pal}[7]{Supreme Lay on Hands}[Magical] When you use your \textit{lay on hands} ability, you both remove a condition from the target and restore its hit points instead of having to choose between the two.
        In addition, you can also choose to remove a \glossterm{vital wound} of the target's choice from it.
        If you do, you gain two \glossterm{fatigue points}.

    \newpage
    \subsection{Zealous Warrior}
        This archetype improves your combat prowess, especially against foes who do not share your devoted alignment.

        \cf{Pal}[0]{Zealous Exertion} You gain a \plus2 bonus to any roll that you use the \textit{desperate exertion} ability on.
        This bonus stacks with the normal \plus2 bonus provided by that ability.

        \cf{Pal}[1]{Smite}[Magical] You can use the \textit{smite} ability as a standard action.
        % This ability gets rank upgrades while maneuvers don't
        % because maneuvers are upgraded into higher rank maneuvers,
        % while this has no upgrades and should remain relevant alone.
        \begin{freeability}{Smite}
            Make a \glossterm{strike}.
            Because this is a \glossterm{magical} ability, you use your \glossterm{magical} \glossterm{power} to determine your damage instead of your \glossterm{mundane} power.
            If your target shares your devoted alignment, the strike deals no damage.
            Otherwise, you gain a \plus1d bonus to damage with the strike.

            \rankline
            \rank{3} The damage bonus increases to \plus2d.
            \rank{5} The damage bonus increases to \plus3d.

        \end{freeability}

        \cf{Pal}[2]{Zealous Offense} You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy}.

        \cf{Pal}[3]{Glancing Strikes} Whenever you miss by 2 or less with a \glossterm{strike}, the target takes half damage from the strike.
        This is called a \glossterm{glancing blow}.

        \cf{Pal}[4]{Zealous Purge} You can use your \textit{zealous purge} ability as a standard action.
        \begin{freeability}{Zealous Purge}
            Make a \glossterm{strike}.
            You add half your \glossterm{power} to damage with the strike instead of your full power.
            Because this is a \glossterm{magical} ability, you use your \glossterm{magical} \glossterm{power} to determine your damage instead of your \glossterm{mundane} power.

            If the target takes damage from the strike, it stops being \glossterm{attuned} to one effect.
            It can freely choose which effect it releases its attunement to.

            \rankline
            \rank{6} The target stops being attuned to two effects instead of one.
        \end{freeability}

        \cf{Pal}[6]{Zealous Fixation} Whenever you hit a creature with a \glossterm{strike}, you ignore \glossterm{concealment} and all \glossterm{miss chances} against that creature with your attacks until you take a \glossterm{short rest} or until you hit a different creature with a strike.
        If you hit multiple creatures with the same strike, you may freely choose which creature to fixate on with this ability.

        \cf{Pal}[7]{Pass Judgment}[Magical] You can use the \textit{pass judgment} ability as a \glossterm{minor action}.
        \begin{freeability}{Pass Judgment}
            \target{One creature within \rnglong range}
            The target is treated as if it had the alignment opposed to your devoted alignment for the purpose of all abilities.
            This only affects its alignment along the alignment axis your devoted alignment is on.
            For example, if your devoted alignment was evil, a chaotic neutral target would be treated as chaotic good.
            This ability lasts until you \glossterm{dismiss} it as a \glossterm{free action}.

            You can use this ability to do battle against foes who share your alignment, but you should exercise caution in doing so.
            Persecution of those who share your ideals can lead you to fall and become an ex-paladin.
        \end{freeability}

        % TODO: Doesn't work with new spell system
        % \cf{Pal}[20]{Martyr's Retribution}[Mag]
        % If you die in the service of your devoted alignment, you may choose to have your fallen body erupt in an immense burst of divine energy.
        % If you do, your body is almost completely consumed, preventing you from being raised with \ritual{resurrection} and similar effects that require an intact body.
        % This burst has two effects.
        % First, a \spell{sunburst} spell immediately takes effect over the area where you died.
        % Second, a \spell{storm of vengeance} spell begins to take effect, centered on the same area.
        % The spell lasts for 10 rounds, and the lightning strikes target the paladin's enemies.
        % Both of these effects harm only the paladin's foes, and do not harm your allies.
        % However, your allies' vision is still impeded by the \spell{storm of vengeance}.

    \subsection{Ex-Paladins}
        If you cease to follow your devoted alignment, you lose all \glossterm{magical} paladin class abilities.
        If your atone for your misdeeds and resume the service of your devoted alignment, you can regain your abilities.

        This ability requires 8 hours of training and attunement which the target must actively participate in.
        You can compel a wild animal to undergo this training by sustaining the \textit{command} ability from the Creature Handling skill (see \pcref{Command}).

            The target serves as a loyal companion to you.
            It follows your directions to the best of its ability.
            Animals are unable to understand complex concepts, so their ability to obey convoluted instructions is limited.

            Your magical connection to the animal improves its resilience and strength in combat.
            If any of its statistics are higher than the normal values below, the animal uses its own statistics instead.
            All other aspects of the animal, such as its speed and natural weapons, are unchanged.
            % Same as Natural Servant except that it gains resistances since having the animal die is more problematic

                \item Its \glossterm{resistance} to \glossterm{energy damage} is equal to your Willpower \add the base value for your level.
                \item Each of its \glossterm{defenses} is normally equal to 5 \add your level.
                \item Its \glossterm{accuracy} is equal to your level \add half your base Perception \add your \glossterm{magic bonuses} to accuracy.
                \item Its \glossterm{power} with its attacks is normally equal to your \glossterm{power} \sub 2.
                \item It has no \glossterm{attunement points}.

        This archetype grants you the ability to inspire your allies and impair your foes with musical performances.

        \cf{Rog}[0]{Bardic Lore} You gain two additional skill points.
        In addition, you gain all Knowledge skills as \glossterm{class skills}.

        \cf{Rog}[1]{Bardic Performances}[Magical]
        You learn two \textit{bardic performances} from the list below.
        You can also spend \glossterm{insight points} to learn one additional bardic performance per \glossterm{insight point}.
        You can use any bardic performance you know as a \glossterm{standard action} unless it specifies that it requires a different type of action to activate.

        All \textit{bardic performances} have the \glossterm{Auditory} tag.
        When you use a \textit{bardic performance} ability, you begin a performance using one of your Perform skills.
        You must use either an instrumental performance or a vocal performance, and not a visual performance.
        If you use a vocal performance, the bardic performance gains the \glossterm{Speech} tag, preventing it from affecting creatures that do not speak the language you perform in.
        You must be \glossterm{trained} with a Perform skill capable of making an auditory performance to use a bardic performance ability.
        If you are \glossterm{mastered} with an appropriate Perform skill, you gain a \plus2 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with the ability.

        The names of bardic performances do not have to precisely match your actual performance.
        For example, you can use the \textit{palliative poem} ability with a gentle song using Perform (wind instruments) or a distracting joke using Perform (comedy) instead of a poem.

        Many bardic performances require you to sustain the performance as a \glossterm{minor action}.
        If the targets stop being able to see or hear you, depending on the nature of your performance, the effect ends for them as if you had stopped sustaining the performance.
        However, targets do not stop being affected by your performance simply by travelling beyond the initial range of the bardic performance ability.
        Using a bardic performance ability with an immediate effect does not interfere with your ability to sustain other bardic performance abilities.

            % Bardic performance power guidelines:
            % These generally start from the same rank 1 baseline effect as spells.
            % Since there are no higher rank bardic performances, they need more aggressive rank scalings to ensure
            % that a rank 7 bardic performance is comparable to a rank 7 spell. That is provided by the greater/supreme
            % bardic performance class abilities, and doesn't need to be included in each individual performance.
            % In general, bardsongs are likely to trade damage or accuracy for increased area.
            %
            % Bardsong debuffs are interesting, since they can't be removed like conditions, but also can't be stacked.

    \classbasics{Alignment} Any.

    \classbasics{Archetypes} Sorcerers have the Arcane Magic, Arcane Spell Mastery, Draconic Magic, Innate Arcanist, and Wild Magic \glossterm{archetypes}.

        \cf{Sor}{Defenses}

        You are proficient with simple weapons.

        \cf{Sor}{Armor Proficiencies} 
        You are not proficient with any type of armor.
        Encumbrance from armor interferes with the gestures you make to cast spells, which can cause your spells with \glossterm{somatic components} to fail (see \pcref{Somatic Component Failure}).

    \newpage
    \subsection{Arcane Magic}
        This archetype grants you the ability to cast arcane spells.

        \cf{Sor}[0]{Cantrips}[Magical]
        Your deity grants you the ability to use arcane magic.
        You gain access to one arcane \glossterm{mystic sphere} (see \pcref{Arcane Mystic Spheres}).

        You automatically learn all \glossterm{cantrips} from any mystic sphere you have access to.
        You do not yet gain access to any other spells from those mystic spheres.

        Arcane spells require both \glossterm{verbal components} and \glossterm{somatic components} to cast (see \pcref{Casting Components}).
        For details about mystic spheres and casting spells, see \pcref{Spell and Ritual Mechanics}.

        \cf{Sor}[0]{Mage Armor}[Magical] You can use the \textit{mage armor} ability as a standard action.
        \begin{freeability}{Mage Armor}
            You create a translucent suit of magical armor on your body and over your hands.
            This functions like body armor that provides a \plus2 bonus to Armor defense and has no \glossterm{encumbrance}.
            It also provides a \plus4 bonus to \glossterm{resistance} against \glossterm{energy damage}, and a \plus2 bonus to \glossterm{resistance} against \glossterm{physical damage}.
            The body armor does not appear if you are wearing other body armor of any kind.

            As long as you have a free hand, the barrier also manifests as a shield that provides a \plus1 bonus to Armor defense.
            This bonus is considered to come from a shield, and does not stack with the benefits of using a physical shield.

            This ability lasts until you use it again or until you \glossterm{dismiss} it as a free action.
        \end{freeability}

            you can forget any number of spells you know to learn that many new spells in exchange,

        In addition, its bonus to \glossterm{resistance} against \glossterm{energy damage} increases to be equal to four times your rank in this archetype, and its bonus to resistances against \glossterm{physical damage} increaess to be equal to twice your rank in this archetype.

        In addition, the bonus to \glossterm{resistance} from your \textit{draconic bloodline} ability increases to be equal to four times your rank in this archetype.

        \cf{Sor}[7]{Greater Draconic Precision} The bonus from your \textit{draconic precision} ability increases to \plus2.

    \newpage
    \subsection{Innate Arcanist}
        This archetype deepens your innate connection to arcane magic.
        You must have the Arcane Magic archetype from the sorcerer class to gain the abilities from this archetype.

        \cf{Sor}[0]{Arcane Body} You gain a \plus2 bonus to the Spellsense skill and a \plus1 bonus to Fortitude defense.

        \cf{Sor}[1]{Innate Magic} None of your arcane spells have \glossterm{somatic components} or \glossterm{verbal components}.

        \cf{Sor}[2]{Mystic Tolerance} You gain a bonus equal to twice your rank in this archetype to your \glossterm{resistance} against \glossterm{energy damage}.

        \cf{Sor}[3]{Personal Enhancement} You gain a \plus1 \glossterm{magic bonus} to \glossterm{accuracy}, \glossterm{defenses}, and \glossterm{power}.
        Because this is a magic bonus, it does not stack with other magic bonuses (see \pcref{Stacking Rules}).

        \cf{Sor}[4]{Spell Absorption} Whenever another creature uses a spell to attack you, you gain the ability to cast the spell once.
        When you cast the spell, you use your own \glossterm{accuracy}, \glossterm{power}, and abilities to determine the effects of the spell.
        Once you cast the spell, you expend the absorbed energy, and you cannot cast it again.

        Whenever you are attacked by a new spell, if you already have the ability to cast a spell with this ability, you choose which spell you gain the ability to cast.
        When you take a \glossterm{long rest}, you lose the ability to cast any spells you have stored with this ability.

        \cf{Sor}[5]{Greater Mystic Tolerance} The bonus from your \textit{mystic tolerance} ability increases to be equal to three times your rank in this archetype.

        \cf{Sor}[6]{Greater Personal Enhancement} The bonuses from your \textit{personal enhancement} ability increase to \plus2.

        \cf{Sor}[7]{Greater Spell Absorption} You can store the ability to cast up to three spells with your \textit{spell absorption} ability.
        In addition, you can cast each stored spell twice before you lose the ability to cast it instead of only once.

    \newpage
    \subsection{Wild Magic}
        This archetype makes the magic you cast more chaotic, generally increasing its power at the cost of your control over your magic.
        You must have the Arcane Magic archetype from the sorcerer class to gain the abilities from this archetype.

        \cf{Sor}[0]{Chaotic Exertion} You gain a \plus2 bonus to the roll when you use the \textit{desperate exertion} ability.
        This bonus stacks with the normal \plus2 bonus provided by that ability.

        \cf{Sor}[1]{Wildspell} Whenever you cast a spell that does not have the \glossterm{Attune} or \glossterm{Sustain} tags, you may use this ability after making all other decisions for the spell (such as targets, intended area, and so on).
        When you do, you gain a bonus equal to your rank in this archetype to \glossterm{power} with the spell.
        In addition, roll 1d10 and apply the corresponding wild magic effect from \trefnp{Wild Magic Effects}.
        Some wild magic effects cannot be meaningfully applied to all spells.
        For example, changing the damage dealt by a spell does not affect spells that do not deal damage.
        Any wildspell effects that do not make sense for a particular spell should be ignored.

        \begin{dtable}
            \lcaption{Wild Magic Effects}

                5 & The spell's area is doubled this round \\

            \end{dtabularx}
        \end{dtable}

        \cf{Sor}[2]{Chaotic Miscast} Whenever you \glossterm{miscast} a spell for any reason other than a wild magic effect, you may instead roll on the \trefnp{Wild Magic Effects} table to determine the spell's effect.
        You take a \minus5 penalty to the roll.
        If the spell's effect is impossible after this roll, such as if all of its targets are invalid, it fails with no effect and is not miscast.

        \cf{Sor}[2]{Wild Soul} You are immune to \glossterm{Compulsion} attacks.

        \cf{Sor}[3]{Greater Chaotic Exertion} Once per \glossterm{long rest}, you can use the \textit{desperate exertion} ability without gaining any \glossterm{fatigue points}.

        \cf{Sor}[4]{Greater Wildspell} The bonus to \glossterm{power} from your \textit{wildspell} ability increases to be equal to twice your rank in this archetype.

        \cf{Sor}[5]{Controlled Chaos} Whenever you make a wild magic roll, you can choose to gain a \plus1 bonus to the roll after seeing the result.

        \cf{Sor}[6]{Supreme Chaotic Exertion} The number of times you can use the \textit{desperate exertion} ability with your \textit{greater chaotic exertion} ability increases to two.

        \cf{Sor}[7]{Supreme Wildspell} You replace your normal wild magic effects from your \textit{wildspell} ability with the effects from the table below.

                3 & When you attack with the spell this round, you roll twice and take the higher result \\
                4 & When you deal damage with the spell this round, you roll twice for the spell and take the higher result \\
                5 & Any \glossterm{conditions} inflicted by the spell this round become a \glossterm{Curse} instead of a condition, and are removed when the target takes a \glossterm{short rest} \\
                6 & When the spell would cause a creature to lose hit points this round, that creature loses twice as many hit points \\
                7 & The spell's area is tripled this round \\

    \end{dtable!*}

    \classbasics{Alignment} Any.

    \classbasics{Archetypes} Warlocks have the Pact Magic, Pact Spell Mastery, and Blessings of the Abyss \glossterm{archetypes}.

    \subsection{Basic Class Abilities}
        If you are a warlock, you gain the following abilities.

        \cf{War}{Defenses}
        You gain the following bonuses to your \glossterm{defenses}: \plus1 Armor, \plus4 Fortitude, \plus3 Reflex, \plus6 Mental.

        \cf{War}{Skills}
        You have the following \glossterm{class skills}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \subparhead{Dexterity} Ride.
            \item \subparhead{Intelligence} Craft, Deduction, Disguise, Knowledge (arcana, planes, religion), Linguistics.
            \item \subparhead{Perception} Awareness, Social Insight, Spellsense.
            \item \subparhead{Other} Deception, Intimidate, Persuasion, Profession.
        \end{itemize}

        \cf{War}{Weapon Proficiencies} 
        You are proficient with simple weapons.

        \cf{War}{Armor Proficiencies}
        You are proficient with light armor.
        Encumbrance from armor interferes with the gestures you make to cast spells, which can cause your spells with \glossterm{somatic components} to fail (see \pcref{Somatic Component Failure}).

        \cf{War}{Infernal Pact}[Magical]
        To become a warlock, you must make a pact with a powerful demon or devil.
        % TODO: wording; intended to prevent Null warlocks who have no pact
        If you somehow lose this ability, you lose all other warlock abilities.
        You must make a dark sacrifice, the details of which are subject to negotiation, and offer a part of your immortal soul.
        In exchange, you gain the powers of a warlock.
        The creature you make the pact with is called your soulkeeper.

        Offering your soul to an entity in this way grants it the ability to communicate with you in limited ways.
        This communication typically manifests as unnatural emotional urges or whispered voices audible only to you.

        Your pact specifies how much of your soul is granted to your soulkeeper, and the circumstances of the transfer.
        The most common arrangement is for a soulkeeper to gain possession of your soul immediately after you die.
        It will keep the soul for one decade per year of your life that you spend as a warlock.
        During that time, it will not prevent you from being resurrected.
        At the end of that time, if your soul remains intact, your soul will pass on to its intended afterlife.
        However, other arrangements are possible, and each warlock's pact can be unique.

        The longer you spend in an afterlife that is not your own, the more likely you are to lose your sense of self and become subsumed by the plane you are on.
        Only a soul of extraordinary strength can maintain its integrity after decades or centuries in the Abyss.
        Many warlocks seek power zealously while mortal to gain the mental fortitude necessary to keep their soul after death.

        \cf{War}{Whispers of the Lost}[Magical]
        You hear the voices of souls lost to the Abyss, linked to you through your soulkeeper.
        Choose one of the following types of whispers that you hear.
        {
            \subcf{Mentoring Whispers} You hear the voice of a dead warlock whose soul is bound to the same soulkeeper as yours.

            \subcf{Spiteful Whispers} You hear the voices of cruel souls who berate you for your flaws and mistakes.

            \subcf{Sycophantic Whispers} You hear the voices of adoring souls who praise your talents and everything you do.

            \subcf{Warning Whispers} You hear the voices of paranoid and fearful souls warning you of danger, both real and imagined.

            \subcf{Whispers of the Mighty} Your soulkeeper forges the connection to your soul into a boon granted to any soul in the Abyss strong enough to claim it in battle.
            You hear the voice of whatever soul currently possesses the boon, which may change suddenly and unexpectedly.
        }

    \newpage
    \subsection{Blessings of the Abyss}

            \rank{3} The damage increases to 2d10.
                In addition, if you miss by 2 or less, the target takes half damage.

            If it loses \glossterm{hit points} from this damage, it is briefly teleported into the Abyss.
            At the end of the next round, it teleports back to its original location, or into the closest open space if that location is occupied.
            After this effect ends, it becomes immune to this spell until it takes a \glossterm{short rest}.
            \glance As above, except that the target takes half damage.

            \rankline
            The damage increases by \plus1d for each rank beyond 3.

            \rank{7} The accuracy bonus increases to \plus2.
        \end{freeability}

        Any other aspects of the ability remain unchanged.

        \cf{War}[6]{Abyssal Curse} You can use the \textit{abyssal curse} ability as a standard action.
        \begin{freeability}{Abyssal Curse}[\glossterm{Curse}, \glossterm{Magical}]

            \hit The target is \glossterm{nauseated} until it takes a \glossterm{short rest}.
            \glance The target is nauseated until the end of the next round.
            \crit The target is nauseated until this curse is removed.

            \rankline
            You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with the attack for each rank beyond 6.
        \end{freeability}

        \cf{War}[7]{Greater Abyssal Substitution} Whenever you use an ability that deals damage, you may change the type of damage it deals to be fire damage.
        Any other aspects of the ability remain unchanged.

    \newpage
    \subsection{Pact Magic}
        This archetype grants you the ability to cast pact spells.

        Unless otherwise noted in a spell's description, casting a spell requires a \glossterm{standard action}.

        When you gain access to a new \glossterm{mystic sphere} or spell \glossterm{rank},
            you can forget any number of spells you know to learn that many new spells in exchange,
            including spells of the higher rank.
        All of those spells must be from pact mystic spheres you have access to.

        \cf{War}[1]{Possession} You can use the \textit{possession} ability as a \glossterm{free action} to allow your soulkeeper to directly control your actions.
        Your soulkeeper's objectives may differ from your own, but except in very unusual circumstances, your soulkeeper is invested in continuing your life and ensuring your victory in difficult circumstances.
        \begin{attuneability}{Possession}[\glossterm{Attune} (self)]
            You gain the following benefits and drawbacks:
            \begin{itemize}
                % This is powerful, but not as strong as Rage, since this ability is less mechanically restrictive.
                \item You gain a bonus equal to twice your rank in this archetype to your \glossterm{power} with \glossterm{magical} abilities.
                \item You gain a \plus4 bonus to your \glossterm{fatigue tolerance}.

            \end{itemize}
        \end{attuneability}

        \cf{War}[2]{Exchange Soul Fragment} Your connection to your soulkeeper deepens, allowing you to send a fragment of your experiences through the link.
        You can use the \textit{exchange soul fragment} ability as a \glossterm{minor action}.

            When you use this ability, you gain a \glossterm{fatigue point}.

            Remove a \glossterm{condition} affecting you.
            This cannot remove a condition applied during the current round.

        You can use the \textit{exchange vitality} ability as a \glossterm{minor action}.
        \begin{freeability}{Exchange Vitality}[\glossterm{Magical}, \glossterm{Swift}]
            When you use this ability, you gain two \glossterm{fatigue points}.

            Remove one of your \glossterm{vital wounds}.
            This cannot remove a vital wound applied during the current round.
            Because this ability has the \glossterm{Swift} tag, the penalties from the removed vital wound do not affect you during the current phase.
        \end{freeability}

        \cf{War}[6]{Supreme Empowering Whispers}[Magical] You gain an additional ability depending on the voices you chose with your \textit{whispers of the lost} ability.

    \end{dtable!*}

    \classbasics{Alignment} Any.

    \classbasics{Archetypes} Mages have the Alchemist, Arcane Magic, Arcane Spell Mastery, and Arcane Scholar \glossterm{archetypes}.

    \subsection{Basic Class Abilities}
        If you are a wizard, you gain the following abilities.

        \cf{Wiz}{Defenses}
        You gain the following bonuses to your \glossterm{defenses}: \plus0 Armor, \plus3 Fortitude, \plus4 Reflex, \plus7 Mental.

        \cf{Wiz}{Skills}
        You have the following \glossterm{class skills}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \subparhead{Intelligence} Craft, Deduction, Knowledge (all kinds, taken individually), Linguistics.
            \item \subparhead{Perception} Awareness, Spellsense.
            \item \subparhead{Other} Deception, Intimidate, Persuasion, Profession.
        \end{itemize}

        \cf{Wiz}{Weapon Proficiencies} 
        You are proficient with simple weapons.

        \cf{Wiz}{Armor Proficiencies}
        You are not proficient with any type of armor.
        Encumbrance from armor interferes with the gestures you make to cast spells, which can cause your spells with \glossterm{somatic components} to fail (see \pcref{Somatic Component Failure}).

    \newpage
    \subsection{Alchemist}
        This archetype improves your ability to use alchemy to create unusual concoctions to aid your allies and harm your foes.

        \cf{Wiz}[0]{Alchemical Infusion} You gain a \plus2 bonus to Craft (alchemy) checks.
        In addition, whenever you create or use an alchemical item, you may use your \glossterm{magical} \glossterm{power} in place of the item's normal power to determine its effects.

        \cf{Wiz}[1]{Portable Workshop} 
        You carry materials necessary to refine low-grade alchemical items wherever you are.
        Items created with this ability deteriorate and become useless after 24 hours or after you finish a long rest, whichever comes first.
        The items are just as effective when used as items created normally.
        You can use this ability create alchemical items with a item level up to your level (see \pcref{Item Levels}).

        Creating an item in this way functions in the same way as crafting alchemical items normally, with the following changes.
        First, you do not require any raw materials.
        Second, the difficulty rating goes up by 5 after each successful craft.
        Third, if you fail to craft an item in this way, you cannot try again until you destroy all items crafted with this ability and finish a short rest.

        If you use this ability extensively without visiting civilization or some other area where you can restock your personal supplies for weeks, you may run low on supplies and your ability to use this ability may be limited.

        \cf{Wiz}[2]{Alchemical Discovery} You gain your choice of one of the following benefits.
        {
            \parhead{Complex Construction} You can use your portable workshop ability to create items with an item level up to two levels higher than your level.
            \parhead{Durable Construction} You double the range of alchemical items you create.
            \parhead{Efficient Crafting} It takes you half the normal time and material components to craft alchemical items.
            \parhead{Explosive Construction} You double the area affected by alchemical items you create.
            \parhead{Potent Construction} Alchemical items you create gain a \plus2 bonus to power.
            \parhead{Repetitive Construction} Whenever you use your portable workshop ability, you can create two copies of the same alchemical item.
            This only counts as one item for the purpose of determining the increase to your crafting difficulty.
            \parhead{Safe Construction} Creatures who are not trained in Craft (alchemy) can use alchemical items you create without a mishap chance.
        }

        \cf{Wiz}[3]{Greater Alchemical Infusion} The skill bonus from your \textit{alchemical infusion} ability increases to \plus4.
        In addition, you gain a \plus1 bonus to accuracy with alchemical items.

        \cf{Wiz}[4]{Experienced Quaffing} You can drink up to two doses of potions, elixirs, and other drinkable alchemical items simultaneously with no mishap risk.

        \cf*{Wiz}[5]{Alchemical Discovery} You gain an additional \textit{alchemical discovery} ability.

        \cf{Wiz}[6]{Supreme Alchemical Infusion} The skill bonus from your \textit{alchemical infusion} ability increases to \plus6.
        In addition, the accuracy bonus from your \textit{greater alchemical infusion} ability increases to \plus2.

        \cf{Wiz}[7]{Greater Portable Workshop} The difficulty rating to craft a new alchemical item with your \textit{portable workshop} ability does not increase with each successful craft.

    \newpage
    \subsection{Arcane Magic}
        This archetype grants you the ability to cast arcane spells.

        \cf{Wiz}[0]{Cantrips}[Magical]
        Your deity grants you the ability to use arcane magic.
        You gain access to one arcane \glossterm{mystic sphere} (see \pcref{Arcane Mystic Spheres}).
        You may spend \glossterm{insight points} to learn one additional arcane \glossterm{mystic sphere} per two \glossterm{insight points}.
        You automatically learn all \glossterm{cantrips} from any mystic sphere you have access to.
        You do not yet gain access to any other spells from those mystic spheres.

        Arcane spells require both \glossterm{verbal components} and \glossterm{somatic components} to cast (see \pcref{Casting Components}).
        For details about mystic spheres and casting spells, see \pcref{Spell and Ritual Mechanics}.

        \cf{Wiz}[0]{Mage Armor}[Magical] You can use the \textit{mage armor} ability as a standard action.
        \begin{freeability}{Mage Armor}
            You create a translucent suit of magical armor on your body and over your hands.
            This functions like body armor that provides a \plus2 bonus to Armor defense and has no \glossterm{encumbrance}.
            It also provides a \plus4 bonus to \glossterm{resistance} against \glossterm{energy damage}, and a \plus2 bonus to \glossterm{resistance} against \glossterm{physical damage}.
            The body armor does not appear if you are wearing other body armor of any kind.

            As long as you have a free hand, the barrier also manifests as a shield that provides a \plus1 bonus to Armor defense.
            This bonus is considered to come from a shield, and does not stack with the benefits of using a physical shield.

            This ability lasts until you use it again or until you \glossterm{dismiss} it as a free action.
        \end{freeability}

        \cf{Wiz}[1]{Spellcasting}[Magical]
        You become a rank 1 arcane spellcaster.
        You learn two rank 1 \glossterm{spells} from arcane \glossterm{mystic spheres} you have access to.
        You can also spend \glossterm{insight points} to learn one additional rank 1 spell per \glossterm{insight point}.
        Unless otherwise noted in a spell's description, casting a spell requires a \glossterm{standard action}.

        When you gain access to a new \glossterm{mystic sphere} or spell \glossterm{rank},
            you can forget any number of spells you know to learn that many new spells in exchange,
            including spells of the higher rank.
        All of those spells must be from arcane mystic spheres you have access to.

        \cf{Wiz}[2]{Spell Rank}[Magical] You become a rank 2 arcane spellcaster.
        This gives you access to spells that require a minimum rank of 2.

        \cf{Wiz}[2]{Spell Knowledge} You learn an additional arcane \glossterm{spell}.

        \cf*{Wiz}[3]{Spell Rank}[Magical] You become a rank 3 arcane spellcaster.
        This gives you access to spells that require a minimum rank of 3 and can improve the effectiveness of your existing spells.

        \cf{Wiz}[3]{Greater Mage Armor}[Magical]
        The defense bonus from the body armor created by your \textit{mage armor} ability increases to \plus3.
        In addition, its bonus to \glossterm{resistance} against \glossterm{energy damage} increases to be equal to three times your rank in this archetype, and its bonus to resistance against \glossterm{physical damage} increases to be equal to your rank in this archetype.

        \cf*{Wiz}[4]{Spell Rank}[Magical] You become a rank 4 arcane spellcaster.
        This gives you access to spells that require a minimum rank of 4 and can improve the effectiveness of your existing spells.

        \cf*{Wiz}[4]{Spell Knowledge} You learn an additional arcane \glossterm{spell}.

        \cf*{Wiz}[5]{Spell Rank}[Magical] You become a rank 5 arcane spellcaster.
        This gives you access to spells that require a minimum rank of 5 and can improve the effectiveness of your existing spells.

        \cf*{Wiz}[6]{Spell Rank}[Magical] You become a rank 6 arcane spellcaster.
        This gives you access to spells that require a minimum rank of 6 and can improve the effectiveness of your existing spells.

        \cf{Wiz}[6]{Supreme Mage Armor}[Magical]
        The defense bonus from the body armor created by your \textit{mage armor} ability increases to \plus4.
        In addition, its bonus to \glossterm{resistance} against \glossterm{energy damage} increases to be equal to four times your rank in this archetype, and its bonus to resistances against \glossterm{physical damage} increaess to be equal to twice your rank in this archetype.

        \cf*{Wiz}[7]{Spell Rank}[Magical] You become a rank 7 arcane spellcaster.
        This gives you access to spells that require a minimum rank of 7 and can improve the effectiveness of your existing spells.

        \cf*{Wiz}[7]{Spell Knowledge} You learn an additional arcane \glossterm{spell}.

    \newpage
    \subsection{Arcane Scholar}
        This archetype deepens your study of arcane magic.
        You have the Arcane Magic archetype from the wizard class to gain the abilities from this archetype.

        \cf{Wiz}[0]{Scholastic Lore} You gain a \plus2 bonus to the Spellsense skill and all Knowledge skills.

        \cf{Wiz}[1]{Ritualist} You gain the ability to perform arcane rituals to create unique magical effects (see \pcref{Rituals}).
        The maximum \glossterm{rank} of arcane ritual you can learn or perform is equal to the maximum rank of arcane spell that you can cast.
        If you have the ability to cast rank 1 arcane spells, you may immediately scribe one rank 1 ritual without paying the normal costs.
        In addition, whenever you gain access to a new spell rank, you can scribe one ritual of that rank or lower without paying the normal costs.

        \cf{Wiz}[2]{Scholastic Insight}[Magical]
        You gain one of the following insights.
        Some insights can be chosen multiple times, as indicated in their descriptions.

        {
            \parhead{Esoteric Spell Knowledge} You learn a single spell from any arcane \glossterm{mystic sphere}.
            You do not not need to have access to that mystic sphere.
            This does not grant you access to that mystic sphere for any other purposes.
            Whenever you gain access to a new mystic sphere or spell rank, you may choose a different spell with this ability.
            \par You can choose this insight multiple times, learning an additional spell each time.

            \parhead{Expanded Sphere Access} You gain access to a new \glossterm{mystic sphere}.
            \par You cannot choose this insight multiple times.

            \parhead{Signature Spell} Choose a \glossterm{spell} you know.
            The spell loses the \glossterm{Focus} tag, allowing you to cast it without lowering your guard in combat.
            \par If you choose this insight multiple times, you must choose a different \glossterm{spell} each time.

            \parhead{Sphere Specialization} Choose a a \glossterm{mystic sphere} you have access to.
            You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with abilities from that \glossterm{mystic sphere}.
            In addition, you learn an additional \glossterm{spell} from that \glossterm{mystic sphere}.
            In exchange, you must lose access to another \glossterm{mystic sphere} you have.
            You must exchange all spells you know from that \glossterm{mystic sphere} with spells from other \glossterm{mystic spheres} you have access to.
            \par You cannot choose this insight multiple times.

            \parhead{Memorized Sphere} % TODO: clarify you need to be high enough rank?
            Choose a \glossterm{mystic sphere} you have access to.
            You can perform rituals from that \glossterm{mystic sphere} without having them written in your ritual book.
            If you lead a ritual from that \glossterm{mystic sphere}, it requires half the normal amount of time to perform and causes half the normal number of \glossterm{fatigue points}.
            \par You can choose this insight multiple times, choosing a different \glossterm{mystic sphere} each time.
        }

        \cf{Wiz}[3]{Greater Scholastic Lore} The bonuses from your \textit{scholastic lore} ability increase to \plus4.

        \cf{Wiz}[4]{Contingency} You gain the ability to prepare a spell so it takes effect automatically if specific circumstances arise.
        % If any spells take more than one standard action, they would need to be excluded from Contingency, but none exist
        % You can apply this ability to any arcane spell that can be cast as a \glossterm{standard action} or \glossterm{minor action}.
        Preparing a spell with this ability takes 5 minutes.
        When the preparation is complete, the spell has no immediate effect.
        Instead, it automatically takes effect when some specific circumstances arise.
        During the time required to cast the spell, you specify what circumstances cause the spell to take effect.

        The spell can be set to trigger in response to any circumstances that a typical human observing you and your situation could detect.
        For example, you could specify ``when I fall at least 50 feet'' or ``when I take a \glossterm{vital wound}'', but not ``when there is an invisible creature within 50 feet of me'' or ``when I have only one \glossterm{hit point} remaining.''
        The more specific the required circumstances, the better -- vague requirements, such as ``when I am in danger'', may cause the spell to trigger unexpectedly or fail to trigger at all.
        If you attempt to specify multiple separate triggering conditions, such as ``when I take damage or when an enemy is adjacent to me'', the spell will randomly ignore all but one of the conditions.

        If the spell needs to be targeted, the trigger condition can specify a simple rule for identifying how to target the spell, such as ``the closest enemy''.
        If the rule is poorly worded or imprecise, the spell may target incorrectly or fail to activate at all.
        Any spells which require decisions, such as the \spell{dimension door} spell, must have those decisions made at the time it is cast.
        You cannot alter those decisions when the contingency takes effect.

        You can have only one spell with this ability active at a time.
        If you use this ability again with a different spell, the old contingency is removed.

        \cf*{Wiz}[5]{Arcane Insight}[Magical]
        You learn an additional \textit{arcane insight}.

        \cf{Wiz}[6]{Greater Ritualist} Whenever you lead a ritual, it requires half the normal number of \glossterm{fatigue points} and half the normal time to complete.

        \cf{Wiz}[7]{Multiple Contingency} You may have two separate \textit{contingency} abilities active at the same time.
