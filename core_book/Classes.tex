\chapter{Classes}\label{Classes}

Your character's class represents the things your character has chosen to train in.
This choice determines a great deal about your character's abilities.

\section{How Classes Work}
    When you first create a character, you choose a class.
    You gain all abilities granted by the \glossterm{archetypes} of your chosen class at the levels indicated in the archetype's description (see Archetypes, below).
    As you gain levels, you gain more abilities from your class.

    \subsection{Archetypes}\label{Archetypes}
        Each class has three or four \glossterm{archetypes}.
        An archetype is a collection of thematically related class abilities.
        For examples, barbarians have the Battlerager archetype, which grants abilities related to flying into a rage in combat.

        You choose three of the archetypes associated with your class at 1st level.
        You gain the abilities from those three archetypes, and you gain no abilities from any additional archetypes the class has.

        \subsubsection{Archetype Ranks}\label{Archetype Ranks}
            You have an \glossterm{archetype rank} associated with each archetype you have.
            Each ability from an archetype has a minimum rank required to gain the ability.

            At 1st level, you are Rank 1 in each archetype.
            This gives you the Rank 1 abilities from each of your archetypes.
            Every level thereafter, you increase your rank in one archetype of your choice.
            This gives you the abilities associated with that rank.

            Each \glossterm{archetype rank} has a minimum level, as shown on \trefnp{Archetype Ranks by Level}.
            This minimum level is included in each class table as a reminder.

            \begin{dtable}
                \lcaption{Archetype Ranks by Level}
                \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{l >{\lcol}X}
                    \tb{Archetype Rank} & \tb{Minimum Level} \tableheaderrule
                    1     & 1
                    \\ 2  & 2
                    \\ 3  & 5
                    \\ 4  & 8
                    \\ 5 & 11
                    \\ 6 & 14
                    \\ 7 & 17
                    \\ 8 & 20
                \end{dtabularx}
            \end{dtable}

        \subsubsection{Duplicate Archetypes}\label{Duplicate Archetypes}
            Some archetypes can be gained by multiple classes.
            For example, both clerics and paladins have the Divine Magic archetype.
            You cannot gain two archetypes with the same name, even if you can choose archetypes from multiple classes.

        \subsection{Multiclass Characters}\label{Multiclass Characters}
            You can spend two \glossterm{insight points} to become a \glossterm{multiclass} character (see \pcref{Insight Points}).
            If you do, choose a class other than your base class.
            You gain the following benefits relating to that class.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item You gain the \glossterm{class skills} of that class in addition to your existing \glossterm{class skills}.
                \item You can exchange any number of your basic class abilities, such as weapon proficiencies, for the corresponding abilities of that class.
                \item If that class has any class abilities which are not part of an archetype, such as a cleric's \textit{divine power}, you gain those abilities.
                \item You may gain one \glossterm{archetype} from your that class in place of one \glossterm{archetype} from your base class.
            \end{itemize}

            You may gain access to multiple classes in this way, spending two \glossterm{insight points} for each class.

    Barbarians are primal warriors that draw power from the physical strength of their bodies.
    A typical barbarian is strong, fast, and durable - and a terrifying threat for their unfortunate enemies to behold.
    They are more inclined to chaos than law, and often have little respect for civilized society, though they may respect authorities with the power to back up their claims.
    They tend to forgo defense in favor of offense, trusting their physical durability to keep them in the fight.
    Barbarians have limited utility outside of combat, though their physical prowess often gives them high physical skills.

    Clerics are divine spellcasters that draw power from their worship of a specific deity.
    Divine magic tends to be more subtle than other forms of magic, and focuses more on aiding yourself and allies than destroy foes with flashy bursts.
    A cleric's deity often grants them influence over specific aspects of the world that the deity has purview over, aligning the cleric's power more closely with that of the deity.
    Some clerics pursue a path of healing, allowing them to keep themselves and their allies healthy through dangerous trials.
    These clerics are commonly found in temples of their gods, tending to the needs of their fellow followers or the wider community.

    \classbasics{Alignment} Your alignment must be within one step of your deity's (that is, it may be one step away on either the lawful-chaotic axis or the good-evil axis, but not both).

                You can ask the fire simple questions and understand its responses.
                If you command the fire to perform a task, it will do so do the best of its ability until this effect ends.
                You cannot compel the fire to move farther than 30 feet in a single round.
                Fire that ends the round on non-combustable materials usually goes out, depending on the circumstances.

                After you use this ability on a particular area of fire, you cannot use it again on that same area for 24 hours.
                % TODO: What does an ``area of fire'' mean?
            \end{attuneability}
            \parhead{Mastery} This domain's domain aspect makes the target \glossterm{ignited} as a \glossterm{condition} instead of dealing damage directly.
            The condition can still be removed in the same way.

        \subsubsection{Good}
            \parhead{Gift} Whenever an adjacent \glossterm{ally} suffers a \glossterm{vital wound}, you may gain a \glossterm{vital wound} instead.
            You gain a \plus2 bonus to the \glossterm{vital roll} of each \glossterm{vital wound} you gain this way.
            The original target suffers any other effects of the attack normally.
            \parhead{Aspect} This domain's domain gift affects any \glossterm{ally} within a \areamed radius \glossterm{emanation} from you.
            \parhead{Essence} You can use the \textit{compel good} ability as a standard action.
            \begin{freeability}{Compel Good}[\glossterm{Compulsion}]
                Make an attack vs. Mental against a creature within \rngmed range.
                Creatures who have strict codes prohibiting them from taking evil actions, such as paladins devoted to Good, are immune to this ability.
                \hit The target takes an good action as soon as it can.
                You have no control over the act the creature takes, but circumstances can make the target more likely to take an action you desire.
            \end{freeability}
            \parhead{Mastery} Whenever an \glossterm{ally} within a \areamed radius \glossterm{emanation} from you loses one or more \glossterm{hit points}, you may lose a single hit point instead.
            The target suffers any other effects of the attack normally.

        \subsubsection{Knowledge}
            If you choose this domain, you add all Knowledge skills to your cleric \glossterm{class skill} list.

            \parhead{Gift} You gain two skill points.
            \parhead{Aspect} Your extensive knowledge of all methods of attack and defense grants you a \plus1 bonus to all defenses.
            \parhead{Essence} You can use the \textit{share knowledge} ability as a standard action.
            \begin{freeability}{Share Knowledge}
                You make a Knowledge check of any kind with a bonus equal to your \glossterm{power}.
                You and your \glossterm{allies} within a \arealarge radius learn the results of your check.
                Creatures believe the information gained in this way to be true as if they it had seen it with their own eyes.

                You cannot alter the knowledge you gain with this check in any way, such as by adding or withholding information.
            \end{freeability}
            \parhead{Mastery} You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with all attacks.

        \subsubsection{Law}
            \parhead{Gift} You gain a \plus2 bonus to Mental defense.
            % Clarify - does this apply to exploding dice?
            \parhead{Aspect} When you roll a 1 on an \glossterm{attack roll}, it is treated as if you had rolled a 6.
            \parhead{Essence} You can use the \textit{compel law} ability as a standard action.
            \begin{freeability}{Compel Law}[\glossterm{Compulsion}]
                Make an attack vs. Mental against all creatures within a \arealarge radius.
                \hit Each target is unable to break the laws that apply in the area, and any attempt to do so simply fails.
                The laws which are applied are those which are most appropriate for the area, regardless of whether you or any other creature know those laws.

                % Sufficiently clear that this isn't part of the hit effect?
                When you use this ability, you also gain the condition.
                If this condition is removed from you, it is also removed from all other affected creatures.
                In areas under ambiguous or nonexistent government, this ability may have unexpected effects, or it may have no effect at all.
            \end{freeability}
            \parhead{Mastery} When you roll less than a 5 on an \glossterm{attack roll}, it is treated as if you had rolled a 5.

        \subsubsection{Life}
            \parhead{Gift} You gain a \plus4 bonus to the Medicine skill (see \pcref{Medicine}).
            \parhead{Aspect} You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{vital rolls}.
            \parhead{Essence} At the end of each round, if you became \glossterm{unconscious} from a \glossterm{vital wound} that round, you can use one \glossterm{magical} ability you have that modifies \glossterm{vital rolls} or removes \glossterm{vital wounds} on yourself without taking an action.
            \parhead{Mastery} The bonus to \glossterm{vital rolls} from this domain's aspect increases to \plus3.

        \subsubsection{Magic}
            If you choose this domain, you add the \sphere{thaumaturgy} \glossterm{mystic sphere} to your list of divine mystic spheres (see \pcref{Mystic Spheres}).

            \parhead{Gift} You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{power} with \glossterm{magical} abilities.
            \parhead{Aspect} You learn an additional \glossterm{spell} for a divine \glossterm{mystic sphere} you have access to.
            \parhead{Essence} You learn an \glossterm{augment} (see \pcref{Augments}).
            You can apply augments to spells to change their effects.
            When you gain access to a new divine spell \glossterm{rank}, you may change which augments you know.
            \parhead{Mastery} You learn an additional \glossterm{augment} (see \pcref{Augments}).
            In addition, the power bonus from this domain's gift increases to \plus2.

        \subsubsection{Protection}
            \parhead{Gift} You gain a \plus1 bonus to your level for the purpose of determining your \glossterm{resistances} (see \pcref{Resistances}).
            \parhead{Aspect} You gain a \plus1 bonus to Armor defense.
            \parhead{Essence} All \glossterm{allies} within a \areamed \glossterm{emanation} from you gain a \plus1 bonus to Armor defense.
            \parhead{Mastery} The area affected by this domain's essence ability increases to a \areahuge emanation.

        \subsubsection{Strength}
            If you choose this domain, you add the Climb, Jump, and Swim skills to your cleric \glossterm{class skill} list.

            \parhead{Gift} You gain two skill points.
            \parhead{Aspect} You gain a \plus4 bonus to Strength for the purpose of checks and determining your carrying capacity.
            \parhead{Essence} You can use the \textit{divine strength} ability as a \glossterm{minor action}.

                You gain a \plus4 \glossterm{magic bonus} to Strength.
            \end{attuneability}
            \parhead{Mastery} You gain a \plus1 bonus to your base Strength.

        \subsubsection{Travel}
            If you choose this domain, you add the \sphere{astromancy} \glossterm{mystic sphere} to your list of divine mystic spheres (see \pcref{Mystic Spheres}).

            \parhead{Essence} You can use the \textit{dimensional travel} ability as a standard action.
            \begin{freeability}{Dimensional Travel}[\glossterm{Teleportation}]
                You teleport up to 1 mile in any direction.
                You do not need \glossterm{line of sight} or \glossterm{line of effect} to your destination, but you must be able to clearly visualize it.
            \end{freeability}
            \parhead{Mastery} When you move, you can teleport the same distance instead.
            This does not change the total distance you can move, but you can teleport in any direction, including vertically.

            You can even attempt to move to locations outside of \glossterm{line of sight} and \glossterm{line of effect}, up to the limit of your remaining movement speed.
            If your intended destination is invalid, the distance you tried to teleport is taken from your remaining movement, but you suffer no other ill effects.

        \subsubsection{Trickery}
            If you choose this domain, you add the Deception, Disguise, and Stealth skills to your cleric \glossterm{class skill} list.

            \parhead{Gift} You gain two skill points.
            \parhead{Aspect} You gain a \plus2 \glossterm{magic bonus} to the Deception, Disguise, and Stealth skills.
            \parhead{Essence} You can use the \textit{compel belief} ability as a standard action.

                Make an attack vs. Mental against a creature within \rngmed range.
                You must also choose a belief that the target has.
                The belief may be a lie that you told it, or even a simple misunderstanding (such as believing a hidden creature is not present in a room).
                If the creature does not already hold the chosen belief, this ability automatically fails.
                \hit The target continues to maintain the chosen belief, regardless of any evidence to the contrary.
                It will interpret any evidence that the falsehood is incorrect to be somehow wrong -- an illusion, a conspiracy to decieve it, or any other reason it can think of to continue believing the falsehood.
                At the end of the effect, the creature can decide whether it believes the falsehood or not, as normal.
            \end{freeability}
            \parhead{Mastery} You are undetectable by Divination spells and effects.
            They cannot detect your presence, sounds you make, or any actions you take.

        \subsubsection{War}
            \parhead{Gift} You gain proficiency with heavy armor and an additional \glossterm{weapon group} of your choice.
            \parhead{Aspect} You reduce your \glossterm{focus penalty} by 1.
            \parhead{Essence} You learn one of the Legion, Selective, or Widened \glossterm{augments} (see \pcref{Augments}).
            You can apply augments to spells to change their effects.
            When you gain access to a new arcane spell \glossterm{rank}, you may change which augments you know, though this augment can only be one of the three listed.
            \parhead{Mastery} You gain a \plus2 bonus to \glossterm{power} with \glossterm{mundane} abilities.

        \subsubsection{Water}
            If you choose this domain, you add the \sphere{aquamancy} \glossterm{mystic sphere} to your list of divine mystic spheres (see \pcref{Mystic Spheres}).
            In addition, you add the Swim skill to your cleric \glossterm{class skill} list.

            \parhead{Gift} You gain a \plus4 \glossterm{magic bonus} to the Swim skill.
            In addition, you gain a \plus1 bonus to Reflex defense.
            \parhead{Aspect} You can breathe water as easily as a human breathes air, preventing you from drowning or suffocating underwater.
            \parhead{Essence} You can use the \textit{speak with water} ability as a standard action.
            \begin{attuneability}{Speak with Water}[\glossterm{Attune} (self)]
                You can speak with and command water within a \areahuge \glossterm{zone} from your location.
                You can ask the water simple questions and understand its responses.
                If you command the water to perform a task, it will do so do the best of its ability until this effect ends.
                You cannot compel the water to move faster than 30 feet per round.

                After you use this ability on a particular area of water, you cannot use it again on that same area for 24 hours.
            \end{attuneability}
            \parhead{Mastery}
            When you move, you can transform yourself into a rushing flow of water with a volume roughly equal to your normal volume until your movement is complete.
            In this form, you may move wherever water could go, you cannot take other actions, such as jumping, attacking, or casting spells.
            You may move through squares occupied by enemies without penalty.
            \par Your speed is halved when moving uphill and doubled when moving downhill.
            Unusually steep inclines may cause greater movement differences while in this form.
            \par If the water is split, you may reform from anywhere the water has reached, to as little as a single ounce of water.
            If not even an ounce of water exists contiguously, your body reforms from all of the largest available sections of water, cut into pieces of appropriate size.
            This usually causes you to die.

        \subsubsection{Wild}
            If you choose this domain, you add the \sphere{verdamancy} \glossterm{mystic sphere} to your list of divine mystic spheres (see \pcref{Mystic Spheres}).
            In addition, you add the Creature Handling, Knowledge (nature), and Survival skills to your cleric \glossterm{class skill} list.

            \parhead{Gift} You gain two skill points.
            % TODO: clarify whether you can have this and the druid ability
            \parhead{Aspect} This ability functions like the \textit{wild aspect} druid ability from the Shifter archetype (see \pcref{Shifter}), except that you cannot spend \glossterm{insight points} to learn additional wild aspects.
            \parhead{Essence} You learn an additional \textit{wild aspect}.
            \parhead{Mastery} You learn an additional \textit{wild aspect}.
            % TODO: essence, mastery

        \subsubsection{Ex-Clerics}
            If you grossly violate the code of conduct required by your deity, you lose all spells and magical cleric class abilities.
            You cannot regain those abilities until you atone for your transgressions to your deity.

    Druids are nature spellcasters that draw power from their veneration of the natural world.
    Nature magic can be used to help allies or to crush foes with natural elements like air or fire.
    Many druids live outside of organized society, either on their own or in small communes with other druids and similarly minded people.
    Druids have strong ties to the natural world with a variety of abilities other than their spells.
    They can speak with and command animals or elements, or even change their body to take on on aspects of animals themselves.

    \classbasics{Alignment} Neutral good, lawful neutral, neutral, chaotic neutral, or neutral evil.

    \classbasics{Archetypes} Druids have the Elementalist, Nature Spellcasting, Nature Spell Mastery, Shifter, and Wildspeaker \glossterm{archetypes}.

    \subsection{Basic Class Abilities}
        If you are a druid, you gain the following abilities.

        \cf{Drd}{Defenses}
        You gain the following bonuses to your \glossterm{defenses}: \plus2 Armor, \plus5 Fortitude, \plus4 Reflex, \plus5 Mental.

        \cf{Drd}{Skills}
        You have the following \glossterm{class skills}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \subparhead{Strength} Climb, Jump, Swim.
            \item \subparhead{Dexterity} Acrobatics, Ride, Stealth.
            \item \subparhead{Constitution} Endurance.
            \item \subparhead{Intelligence} Craft, Deduction, Knowledge (geography, nature), Medicine.
            \item \subparhead{Perception} Awareness, Creature Handling, Survival.
            \item \subparhead{Other} Deception, Intimidate, Persuasion, Profession.
        \end{itemize}

        \cf{Drd}{Weapon Proficiencies} 
        You are proficient with simple weapons, any one other \glossterm{weapon group}, scimitars, and sickles.

        \cf{Drd}{Armor Proficiencies} 
        You are proficient with light and medium armor.
        However, you cannot use metal armor; see the Metal Abhorrence ability, below.

        \cf{Drd}{Metal Abhorrence}
        The oaths that you swear as part of your druidic initiation prohibit you from using armor made of metal.
        If you wear prohibited armor or carry a prohibited shield, you are unable to cast druid spells or use any of your \glossterm{magical} druid abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.
        % TODO: if weapon materials were more clearly defined, this could be prohibited as well
        This does not prevent you from using metallic weapons.

        You can avoid this penalty by using armor made of wood altered with the \ritual{ironwood} ritual.
        Such wood is as strong as steel.

    \subsection{Elementalist}\label{Elementalist}
        This archetype grants you influence over four elements that define the natural world: air, earth, fire, and water.

        \cf{Drd}[1]{Elemental Balance} You gain a small benefit from each of the four elements.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Air: You gain a \plus2 bonus to the Jump skill.
            \item Earth: You gain a \plus1 bonus to Fortitude defense.
            \item Fire: You gain a bonus to \glossterm{resistances} against fire damage equal to half your \glossterm{power}.
            \item Water: You gain a \plus2 bonus to the Swim skill.
        \end{itemize}

        \cf{Drd}[2]{Elemental Magic} Choose one of the \glossterm{mystic spheres} associated with the four elements: \sphere{aeromancy}, \sphere{aquamancy}, \sphere{pyromancy}, or \sphere{terramancy}.
        If you already have access to that mystic sphere, you learn two spells from that sphere.
        Otherwise, you gain access to that mystic sphere, including all \glossterm{cantrips} from that sphere.

        \cf{Drd}[3]{Elemental Influence} You can use the \textit{elemental influence} ability as a standard action.
        \begin{freeability}{Elemental Influence}[\glossterm{Sustain} (standard)]
            You can speak with air, earth, fire, and water within a \areahuge \glossterm{zone} from your location.
            You can ask the elements simple questions and understand their responses.
            Each element is only able to give information based on what it touched, not any more subtle characteristics.
            For example, air and water could tell you the size category and general shape (such as bipedal or four-legged) of a creature that passed through them recently, but not any details about color or subjective appearance.
            Each element has different limitations on its memory and awareness, as described below.

            \begin{itemize}
                \item Air: Air can remember events up to an hour ago on a very calm day or only a few minutes ago on a windy day.
                    Moving air is aware of events near where it blew through, not necessarily in your current location.
                \item Earth: Earth can remember events up to a year ago, but its awareness is extremely limited.
                    It can only remember very large events, such as giant creatures tearing up the terrain, earthquakes, or major construction.
                    Earth can tell you whether there exist underground tunnels within the area, but any sort of detailed mapping is beyond its ability to communicate.
                \item Fire: Fire can remember everything it touched and consumed since it started burning.
                    Individual pieces of a very large fire, such as a particular burning tree in a forest fire, are not aware of the behavior of the entirety of the fire.
                    However, the fire on burning tree could tell you how it got to the tree and everything it burned along the way, including the event that started the forest fire.
                \item Water: Water can remember events up to a day ago in a very calm pool or only a few minutes ago in a rushing river.
                    Moving water is aware of events near where it moved through, not necessarily in your current location.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{freeability}

        % TODO: are there any spells or rituals that have material components or focus objects?
        % but are unable to cast spells or perform rituals that require material components or focus objects.

        While not possessing a plant or animal, you can rest, or you can focus on reincarnating your physical form.
        Creating a new body in this way takes 12 consecutive hours of concentration.
        At the end of that time, you are reincarnated in a new body in your location, as the effect of the \ritual{reincarnation} ritual, except that you can choose your species from among the species listed (not including the ``Other'' species).

        While you are an avatar of nature, you do not age and you cannot die of old age.
        You can continue to exist in this form indefinitely.

    \subsection{Wildspeaker}\label{Wildspeaker}

        \cf{Drd}[1]{Natural Servant}[Magical]
        You can use the \textit{natural servant} ability.
        This ability requires spending 1 hour performing rituals in a natural area.
        \begin{attuneability}{Natural Servant}[\glossterm{Attune} (self), \glossterm{Magical}]
            An animal native to the local environment appears to help you.
            It follows your directions to the best of its ability as long as you remain in its natural environment.
            Animals are unable to understand complex concepts, so their ability to obey convoluted instructions is limited.
            If you leave the animal's natural habitat, it remains behind and this effect ends.
            If the animal gains a \glossterm{vital wound} or has no hit points remaining at the end of the round, this effect ends.

            Your magical connection to the animal improves its resilience and strength in combat.
            The animal's statistics use the values below, except that each animal also gains a special ability based on the environment you are in.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Its \glossterm{wound resistance} and \glossterm{vital resistance} are equal to the base values for your level (see \pcref{Resistance Values}).
                \item It has 10 \glossterm{hit points}.
                \item Each of its \glossterm{defenses} is equal to 5 \add your level.
                \item Its \glossterm{accuracy} is equal to your \glossterm{accuracy} \sub 1.
                \item Its \glossterm{power} with its attacks is equal to your \glossterm{power}.
                \item Its \glossterm{base speed} is the normal base speed for its size.
                \item It has no \glossterm{action points}.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{attuneability}

        The special ability of the animal that appears depends on your environment, as described below.
        You may choose a different animal native to that environment that is similar in size and type, but that does not change the animal's statistics.
        For example, your \textit{natural servant} in an aquatic environment may be a fish or seal instead of a shark.
        Unusual environments may have different animals than the standard animals listed below.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Aquatic: A Small shark appears that has a 30 foot \glossterm{swim speed} and no land speed.
                It has a bite \glossterm{natural weapon}.
            \item Arctic: An Small arctic fox appears that has no penalties for being in cold environments.
                It has a bite \glossterm{natural weapon}.
            \item Desert: A Small hyena appears that has no penalties for being in hot environments.
                It has a bite \glossterm{natural weapon}.
            \item Mountain: A Small goat appears that can move up or down steep slopes without slowing its movement.
                It has a ram \glossterm{natural weapon}.
            \item Forest: A Small wolverine appears that has two additional \glossterm{hit points}.
                It has a bite \glossterm{natural weapon}.
            \item Plains: A Small wolf appears that has the \glossterm{scent} ability.
                It has a bite \glossterm{natural weapon}.
            \item Swamp: A Small crocodile appears that has a 15 foot \glossterm{land speed} and a 25 foot \glossterm{swim speed}.
                It has a bite \glossterm{natural weapon}.
            \item Underground: A Small dire rat appears that has \glossterm{low-light vision}.
                It has a bite \glossterm{natural weapon}.
        \end{itemize}

        \cf{Drd}[2]{Animal Speech}[Magical] You can use the \textit{animal speech} ability as a standard action.
        \begin{attuneability}{Animal Speech}[\glossterm{Sustain} (minor)]
            Choose an animal within \rnglong range.
            You can speak to and understand the speech of the target animal, and any other animals of the same species.

            This ability does not make the target any more friendly or cooperative than normal.
            Wary and cunning animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while stupid ones tend to make inane comments and are unlikely to say or understand anything of use.
        \end{attuneability}

        \cf{Drd}[3]{Wild Guardian}[Magical] Wild animals and plants will not willingly attack you.
        They can be compelled to attack you with a Creature Handling check with a \glossterm{difficulty rating} equal to 10 \add your \glossterm{power}.
        If you attack an animal or plant, this ability no longer provides protection against it and its \glossterm{allies}.
        This effect does not protect your allies from attack.

        \cf{Drd}[4]{Greater Natural Servant}[Magical] Your \textit{natural servant} gains an \glossterm{action point}.
        This action point is shared among any creatures you summon with your \textit{natural servant} ability, and is only recovered when you take a \glossterm{long rest}.
        In addition, you can summon an alternate \textit{natural servant} based on your local environment, as described below.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Aquatic: A Medium shark appears that has a 40 foot \glossterm{swim speed} and no land speed.
                It has a bite \glossterm{natural weapon}.
            \item Arctic: An Medium polar bear appears that has a bonus to \glossterm{resistances} against cold damage equal to your \glossterm{power}.
                It has a bite \glossterm{natural weapon} and two claw \glossterm{natural weapons}.
            \item Desert: A Medium camel appears that has no penalties for being in hot environments.
                It has a bite \glossterm{natural weapon}.
            \item Mountain: A Medium goat appears that can move up or down steep slopes without slowing its movement.
                It has a ram \glossterm{natural weapon}.
            \item Forest: A Medium bear appears that has four additional \glossterm{hit points}.
                It has a bite \glossterm{natural weapon} and two claw \glossterm{natural weapons}.
            \item Plains: A Medium wolf appears that has the \glossterm{scent} ability.
                It has a bite \glossterm{natural weapon}.
            % TODO: define shallow water
            \item Swamp: A Medium crocodile appears that has a 20 foot \glossterm{land speed} and a 30 foot \glossterm{swim speed}.
                It has a bite \glossterm{natural weapon}.
            \item Underground: A Medium dire rat appears that has \glossterm{low-light vision} and \glossterm{darkvision}.
                It has a bite \glossterm{natural weapon}.
        \end{itemize}

        \cf{Drd}[5]{Plant Speech}[Magical] When you use your \textit{animal speech} ability, you can target a plant instead of an animal.
        When you do, you can speak to and understand the speech of the target plant, and any other plants of the same species.

        \cf{Drd}[6]{Greater Wild Guardian}[Magical] Your \glossterm{allies} within a \arealarge radius \glossterm{emanation} from you also gain the benefit of your \textit{wild guardian} ability.
        The protection ends if any target attacks an animal or plant instead of only if you attack.
        In addition, the \glossterm{difficulty rating} of the Creature Handling check increases to 20 \add your \glossterm{power}.

        \cf{Drd}[7]{Supreme Natural Servant}[Magical] Your \textit{natural servant} gains two additional \glossterm{action points}.
        These action points are shared among any creatures you summon with your \textit{natural servant} ability, and are only recovered when you take a \glossterm{long rest}.

        % \subcf{15th -- Air Mantle}
        % You are surrounded by a mantle of air.
        % Thrown and projectile weapons have a 50\% chance to miss your while this effect is active.
        % Unusually large weapons, such as a giant's boulders, may suffer a decreased miss chance as appropriate to their size.
        % \subcf{15th -- Aqueous Step}
        % Wherever the druid moves, you leave a path of animated water that can grab creatures.
        % When a creature crosses the path, the druid makes a Reflex attack to trip the creature, causing it to fall prone and waste the rest of its movement.
        % Your accuracy is equal to your druid level \add your Constitution.
        % \subcf{15th -- Flaming Step}
        % Wherever the druid moves, you leave a path of burning flame behind your that lasts for 1 round.
        % When a creature crosses the path, the druid makes a Reflex attack to deal damage to the creature.
        % The attack deals 1d8 points of fire damage per two druid levels.
        % Your accuracy is equal to your druid level \add your Constitution.
        % A failed attack deals half damage.
        % \subcf{15th -- Lifegiving Step}
        % Wherever the druid moves, you leave a path of small, living plants that entangle foes for 1 round.
        % When a creature crosses the path, the druid makes a Reflex attack to entangle the creature, causing it to waste the rest of its movement.
        % Your accuracy is equal to your druid level \add your Constitution.
        % The plants appear on any surface, and will continue to grow if they can survive, though they may die quickly if they appear on inhospitable terrain.
        % \subcf{17th -- Flaming Soul}
        % You gain the fire subtype, making your immune to fire but giving your a 50\% vulnerability to cold damage.
        % In addition, when you deal fire damage to a creature, the creature is \ignited for 5 rounds.
        % \subcf{17th -- Sunblessed Rejuvenation}
        % You gain fast healing equal to your druid level as long as you remain in sunlight or touches a plant of your size or larger.
        % \subcf{17th -- Sunscour}
        % This aspect functions like the heart of the sun natural aspect, except that it also suppresses shadow effects and the visual components of illusions within the area of bright light.

        % \subcf{17th -- Water's Flow}
        % As a minor action, the druid can transform herself into a rushing flow of water with a volume roughly equal to your normal volume until the end of your turn.
        % In this form, she may move wherever water could go, but she cannot take other actions, such as jumping, attacking, or casting spells.
        % Your speed is halved when moving uphill and doubled when moving downhill.
        % She may move through squares occupied by enemies without penalty.
        % She may return to your normal form as a free action.
        % \par If the water is split, she may reform from anywhere the water has reached, to as little as a single ounce of water.
        % If not even an ounce of water exists contiguously, your body reforms from the largest available parts of water, cut into pieces of appropriate size.
        % This usually causes the druid to die.

    \subsection{Ex-Druids}
        A druid who ceases to revere nature or who changes to a prohibited alignment loses all magical druid class abilities.
        They cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until they atone for their transgressions.

        % \subsection{Variant Druids}

        %     \subsubsection{Blighter}

        %         Blighters draw power from nature, as do other druids. However, while other druids revere nature and draw power from it gently, blighters steal power from nature forcefully. Wherever a blighter goes, destruction and death surely follows.

        %         \altcf{Blight} Instead of meditating to regain spell slots, a blighter draws power from your environment forcefully.
        %         This affects a \areahuge radius zone centered on your, and the process takes 1 minute of concentration.
        %         At the end of every round, every living thing in the area other than the blighter takes damage equal to your nature power.
        %         All inanimate plants of Huge size or smaller immediately wither and die.
        %         The earth becomes cracked and infertile, and any nutrients from the soil are destroyed.
        %         This ability has no effect on artificial environments or materials, such as metal or worked stone.
        %         At the end of the minute, the blighter regains your spent nature spell slots.

        %         A blighter can only blight your surroundings in this way once per hour.
        %         If your surroundings are already blighted or are not natural terrain, she cannot use this ability to regain your spells.
        %         Instead, she must meditate for 8 hours to slowly draw power from your surroundings, as a normal druid.

        %         \altcf{Spells} As normal, except that a blighter adds all Vivimancy arcane spells to your spell list.

        %         \altcf[2]{Wild Speech} As normal, except that a blighter gains a \plus5 bonus to Intimidate against your wild speech targets, and a \minus5 penalty to Persuasion.

        %         \altcf[10]{Blightcasting}

        %         \altcf[20]{Improved Blightcasting}

        % \subsubsection{Rotbringer}

        %     While most druids seek to emulate and interact with animals, rotbringers focus on the power of fungi, decay, and regeneration.

        %     \altcf{Invoke Rot} Instead of meditating to regain spell slots, a rotbringer accelerates the natural forces of decomposition and decay on your environment.
        %     This affects a \areahuge radius zone centered on your, and the process takes 1 minute of concentration.
        %     All organic objects of Huge size or smaller, such as plants and corpses, decompose.
        %     This decomposition kills inanimate, living plants.
        %     All organic objects, regardless of size, are covered with various fungi.
        %     This ability has no effect on artificial environments or materials, such as metal or worked stone.
        %     At the end of the minute, the rotbringer regains your spent nature spell slots.

        %     If the rotbringer decomposes a Huge object with this ability, or a combination of smaller objects equivalent in size to a Huge object, you gain an bonus nature spell slot of your highest available spell level.
        %     This extra spell slot lasts until it is used, or until you regain your spell slots again.

        %     A rotbringer can only invoke rot on your surroundings in this way once per hour.
        %     If your surroundings are already decomposed or are not natural terrain, she cannot use this ability to regain your spells.
        %     Instead, she must meditate for 8 hours to slowly draw power from your surroundings, as a normal druid.

        %     \altcf[2]{Wild Speech} The rotbringer gains the ability to speak with plants at 2nd level.
        %     You gain the ability to speak with animals at 6th level, instead of at 2nd level.

        %     \altcf[3rd]{Wild Aspect} The rotbringer does not gain this ability.

        %     \altcf[3rd]{Rot Spell} The druid learns an additional spell slot and spell known.
        %     The spell must be taken from the following list of spells.
        %     The spell's level cannot exceed half your druid level.
        %     If she already knows a spell from the list at every spell level you ha access to, she may instead learn any nature spell (see \pcref{Nature Spells}).

        %     At 5th level, and every odd level, the druid may learn a new spell.

        The armor has no \glossterm{encumbrance}.

        As long as you have a free hand, the barrier also manifests as a shield that provides a \plus1 bonus to Armor defense.
        This bonus is considered to come from a shield, and does not stack with the benefits of using a physical shield.

        \cf{Mnk}[1]{Ki Manifestations}[Magical]

        Choose one \textit{ki manifestation} from the list below.

                You can use this ability as part of movement.
                % TODO: is 'horizontally' the correct word?
                You teleport horizontally instead of moving normally.
                If your \glossterm{line of effect} to your destination is blocked, or if this teleportation would somehow place you inside a solid object, your teleportation is cancelled and you remain where you are.

                Teleporting a given distance costs movement equal to twice that distance.
                For example, if you have a 30 foot movement speed, you can move 10 feet, teleport 5 feet, and move an additional 10 feet before your movement ends.

        % seems unnecessary
        % You excel at slaying creatures with alignments opposed to your devoted alignment.
        Your alignment cannot be changed without extraordinary repurcussions.

    \subsection{Devoted Paragon}
        This archetype deepens your connection to your alignment, granting you an aura and improving your combat abilities.

        \cf{Pal}[1]{Aligned Aura}[Magical]
        Your devotion to your alignment affects the world around you, bringing it closer to your ideals.
        You constantly radiate an aura in a \areamed radius \glossterm{emanation} from you.
        You can freely choose whether yourself and your \glossterm{allies}, \glossterm{enemies}, and other creatures are affected by the aura.
        The effect of the aura depends on your devoted alignment, as described below.
        You can suppress or resume the aura as a \glossterm{minor action}.

        \subparhead{Chaos} When a target rolls a 1 on an attack roll with a \glossterm{strike}, it \glossterm{explodes} (see \pcref{Exploding Attacks}.
        This does not affect bonus dice rolled for exploding attacks (see \pcref{Exploding Attacks}).
        \subparhead{Evil} Each target suffers a \minus1 penalty to \glossterm{defenses} as long as it is affected by at least one \glossterm{condition}.
        % TODO: clarify what happens if multiple people try to Good aura the same target
        \subparhead{Good} When a target gains a \glossterm{vital wound}, you may gain a \glossterm{vital wound} instead.
        You gain a \plus2 bonus to the \glossterm{vital roll} of each \glossterm{vital wound} you gain this way.
        The target suffers any other effects of the attack normally.
        \subparhead{Law} When a target rolls a 1 on an attack roll with a \glossterm{strike}, the attack roll is treated as a 6.
        This does not affect bonus dice rolled for exploding attacks (see \pcref{Exploding Attacks}).

        Your ability to resist attacks based on your alignment improves.

        \subparhead{Chaos} You are immune to hostile \glossterm{Compulsion} abilities.

        \cf{Pal}[3]{Paragon Power}

        \cf{Pal}[4]{Greater Aligned Aura}[Magical]
        The effect of your \textit{aligned aura} becomes stronger, as described below.

        \subparhead{Chaos} The effect applies to all attacks, not just \glossterm{strikes}.
        \subparhead{Evil} When a target would remove a \glossterm{condition}, the condition instead remains unless it spends an additional \glossterm{action point}.
        \subparhead{Good} When a target loses a \glossterm{hit point}, you may lose that hit point instead.
        The target suffers any other effects of the attack normally.

        \cf{Pal}[8]{Aligned Soul}[Magical]
        While you are dead, you may approach the deity or governing figure of your afterlife and request to be returned to life to continue your mission.
        Travelling to the relevant entity and making the request takes 12 hours.
        This request is almost always granted unless there are extenuating circumstances.
        You are resurrected in a new body at a location of the entity's choice, which is usually a place of power for the entity.
        This functions like the \ritual{resurrection} ritual, except that no part of the body is required, and a new body is created by the entity.
        You can be resurrected in this way regardless of the condition of your body, but not if your soul has been trapped or otherwise prevented from going to the correct afterlife.

    \subsection{Divine Magic}
        This archetype grants you the ability to cast divine spells.

        \cf{Pal}[1]{Spellcasting}[Magical]
        Your devotion to your alignment grants you the ability to use divine magic.
        You gain access to one divine \glossterm{mystic sphere} (see \pcref{Divine Mystic Spheres}).
        You may spend \glossterm{insight points} to learn one additional \glossterm{mystic sphere} per two \glossterm{insight points}.
        Each \glossterm{mystic sphere} has a set of \glossterm{spells} associated with it.

        You automatically learn all \glossterm{cantrips} from any mystic sphere you have access to.
        In addition, you learn two rank 1 \glossterm{spells} from your chosen \glossterm{mystic sphere}.
        You can also spend \glossterm{insight points} to learn one additional divine spell per \glossterm{insight point}.
        Unless otherwise noted in a spell's description, casting a spell requires a \glossterm{standard action}.

        When you gain access to a new \glossterm{mystic sphere} or spell \glossterm{rank},
            you can exchange any number of spells you know for other spells,
            including spells of the higher rank.

        Divine spells require \glossterm{verbal components} to cast (see \pcref{Casting Components}).
        For details about mystic spheres and casting spells, see \pcref{Spell and Ritual Mechanics}.

        \cf{Pal}[2]{Battle Prayer} You reduce your \glossterm{focus penalties} by 2.

        This is a \glossterm{Swift} ability, and it affects attacks made against you in the phase when you cast the spell.

        \cf{Pal}[6]{Greater Wellspring of Power}[Magical]
        The bonus from your \textit{wellspring of power} ability increases to \plus2.

        \cf*{Pal}[7]{Insight Point} You gain an additional \glossterm{insight point}.

    \subsection{Stalwart Guardian}

        \cf{Pal}[1]{Lay on Hands}[Magical] You can use the \textit{lay on hands} ability as a standard action.
        \begin{freeability}{Lay on Hands}
            \target{Yourself or a living \glossterm{ally} within \glossterm{reach}}
            The target regains two \glossterm{hit points}.

            \rankline
            \rank{3} Instead of regaining hit points, the target can choose to remove a \glossterm{condition} affecting it.
            \rank{5} Instead of regaining hit points, the target can choose to spend an \glossterm{action point} to remove a \glossterm{vital wound} affecting it.

        \begin{freeability}{Smite}
            Make a \glossterm{strike}.
            Because this is a \glossterm{magical} ability, you use your \glossterm{power} with \glossterm{magical} abilities to determine your damage instead of your power with \glossterm{mundane} abilities.
            If your target shares your devoted alignment, the strike deals no damage.
            Otherwise, the strike gains a \plus1d bonus to damage.

            \rankline
            \rank{3} The damage bonus increases to \plus2d.
            \rank{5} The damage bonus increases to \plus3d.
            \rank{7} The damage bonus increases to \plus4d.
        \end{freeability}

        \cf{Pal}[2]{Zealous Conviction} You gain a \plus1 bonus to Fortitude and Mental defenses.

        \cf{Pal}[3]{Zealous Purge} You can use your \textit{zealous purge} ability as a standard action.
        \begin{freeability}{Zealous Purge}
            Make a \glossterm{strike}.
            Because this is a \glossterm{magical} ability, you use your \glossterm{power} with \glossterm{magical} abilities to determine your damage instead of your power with \glossterm{mundane} abilities.
            If the target is \glossterm{wounded} by your attack, the target stops being \glossterm{attuned} to one ability of its choice that it is currently attuned to.
            This ability does not affect attunement to magic items.

            \rankline
            \rank{5} If you deal damage with a \glossterm{critical hit}, the target stops being \glossterm{attuned} to all abilities that it is attuned to other than \glossterm{magic items}.
            \rank{7} You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with the strike.
        \end{freeability}

        \cf{Pal}[4]{Pass Judgment}[Magical] When you use your \textit{smite} ability, you can use the \textit{pass judgment} ability.
        \begin{attuneability}{Pass Judgment}[\glossterm{Attune} (self)]
            The target of your \textit{smite} is treated as if it had the alignment opposed to your devoted alignment for the purpose of all abilities, including for your initial \textit{smite}.
            This only affects its alignment along the alignment axis your devoted alignment is on.
            For example, if your devoted alignment was evil, a chaotic neutral target would be treated as chaotic good.

            You can use this ability to do battle against foes who share your alignment, but you should exercise caution in doing so.
            Persecution of those who share your ideals can lead you to fall and become an ex-paladin.
        \end{attuneability}

        \cf{Pal}[5]{Greater Zealous Conviction} The bonus from your \textit{zealous conviction} ability increases to \plus2.

        \cf{Pal}[6]{Zealous Offense} You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy}.

        \cf{Pal}[7]{Greater Pass Judgment} Your \textit{pass judgment} ability loses the \glossterm{Attune} tag.
        Instead, it lasts until you decide to lift your judgment on the target as a \glossterm{free action}.

        % TODO: Doesn't work with new spell system
        % \cf{Pal}[20]{Martyr's Retribution}[Mag]
        % If you die in the service of your devoted alignment, you may choose to have your fallen body erupt in an immense burst of divine energy.
        % If you do, your body is almost completely consumed, preventing you from being raised with \ritual{resurrection} and similar effects that require an intact body.
        % This burst has two effects.
        % First, a \spell{sunburst} spell immediately takes effect over the area where you died.
        % Second, a \spell{storm of vengeance} spell begins to take effect, centered on the same area.
        % The spell lasts for 10 rounds, and the lightning strikes target the paladin's enemies.
        % Both of these effects harm only the paladin's foes, and do not harm your allies.
        % However, your allies' vision is still impeded by the \spell{storm of vengeance}.

    \subsection{Ex-Paladins}
        If you cease to follow your devoted alignment, you lose all \glossterm{magical} paladin class abilities.
        If your atone for your misdeeds and resume the service of your devoted alignment, you can regain your abilities.

        \cf{Rgr}{Armor Proficiencies} 
        You are proficient with light and medium armor.

    \subsection{Beastmaster}
        This archetype improves your connection to animals, allowing you to control and command them in battle.

        \cf{Rgr}[1]{Animal Companion}
        You can use the \textit{animal companion} ability.
        This ability requires 8 hours of training and attunement which the target must actively parcipate in.
        You can compel a wild animal to undergo this training by sustaining the \textit{command} ability from the Creature Handling skill (see \pcref{Command}).
        \begin{attuneability}{Animal Companion}[\glossterm{Attune} (self), \glossterm{Emotion}, \glossterm{Magical}]
            Choose a Medium or smaller animal \glossterm{ally} within your \glossterm{reach} with a level no higher than your level and a \glossterm{challenge rating} no higher than 1.
            The target serves as a loyal companion to you.
            It follows your directions to the best of its ability.
            Animals are unable to understand complex concepts, so their ability to obey convoluted instructions is limited.

            Your magical connection to the animal improves its resilience and strength in combat.
            If any of its statistics are higher than the normal values below, the animal uses its own statistics instead.
            All other aspects of the animal, such as its speed and natural weapons, are unchanged.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Its \glossterm{wound resistance} and \glossterm{vital resistance} are equal to the base values for your level (see \pcref{Resistance Values}).
                \item It has 10 \glossterm{hit points}.
                \item Each of its \glossterm{defenses} is normally equal to 5 \add your level.
                \item Its \glossterm{accuracy} is normally equal to your \glossterm{accuracy} \sub 1.
                \item Its \glossterm{power} with its attacks is normally equal to your \glossterm{power} \sub 2.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{attuneability}

        \cf{Rgr}[2]{Handling Lore} You gain two additional \glossterm{skill points}.
        In addition, you gain a \plus2 bonus to the Creature Handling skill (see \pcref{Creature Handling}).

        \cf{Rgr}[3]{Pack Tactics} You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{defenses} against creatures that are \glossterm{overwhelmed}.

        \cf{Rgr}[4]{Greater Animal Companion} Your \textit{animal companion} gains an \glossterm{action point}.
        In addition, it gains a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy}, \glossterm{defenses}, and \glossterm{vital rolls}.

        \cf{Rgr}[5]{Greater Handling Lore} The bonus from your \textit{handling lore} ability increases to \plus6.

        \cf{Rgr}[6]{Greater Pack Tactics} You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} against \glossterm{overwhelmed} creatures.

        \cf{Rgr}[7]{Supreme Animal Companion} Your \textit{animal companion} gains an additional \glossterm{action point}.
        In addition, the bonuses from your \textit{greater animal companion} ability increase to \plus2.

    \subsection{Keen Senses}
        This archetype improves your senses.

        \cf{Rgr}[1]{Keen Vision}
        You reduce your \glossterm{range increment} penalties for attacking at long range by 1.
        In addition, you gain \glossterm{low-light vision}, allowing you to treat sources of light as if they had double their normal illumination range.
        If you already have low-light vision, you double its benefit, allowing you to treat sources of light as if they had four times their normal illumination range.

        \cf{Rgr}[2]{Learned Perception} You gain two additional skill points.
        In addition, you gain a \plus2 bonus to \glossterm{Awareness}.

        \cf{Rgr}[3]{Blindsense}
        Your perceptions are so finely honed that you can sense your enemies without seeing them.
        You gain the \glossterm{blindsense} ability out to 50 feet.
        This ability allows you to sense the presence and location of objects and foes within 50 feet without seeing them.
        If you already have the blindsense ability, you increase its range by 50 feet.

        \cf{Rgr}[4]{Greater Keen Vision} The penalty reduction from your \textit{keen vision} ability increases to 2.
        In addition, you gain \glossterm{darkvision} with a 50 foot range, allowing you to see in complete darkness clearly.

        You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy}.

        \cf{Rgr}[6]{Blindsight}
        You gain the \glossterm{blindsight} ability, allowing you to ``see'' perfectly without your eyes in a 50 foot radius around you.
        With this ability, you can fight just as well with your eyes closed as with them open.
        In addition, the range of your \glossterm{blindsense} ability increases by 50 feet.

        \cf{Rgr}[7]{Supreme Keen Vision}
        The penalty reduction from your \textit{keen vision} ability increases to 3.
        In addition, your perceptions are accurate enough to defeat even powerful magic.
        You can see through normal and magical darkness and see the truth behind any \glossterm{Visual} effects.
        This ability works at any range.

    \subsection{Huntmaster}
        This archetype grants you and your allies abilities to hunt down specific foes.

        \cf{Rgr}[1]{Quarry}\label{Quarry} You can use the \textit{quarry} ability as a \glossterm{minor action}.
        \begin{attuneability}{Quarry}[\glossterm{Attune} (self)]
            Choose a creature within \rnglong range.
            The target becomes your quarry.
            You and your \glossterm{allies} within the same range are called your hunting party.
            Your hunting party gains a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with \glossterm{mundane} attacks against your quarry.
        \end{attuneability}

        \cf{Rgr}[2]{Hunting Style}
        You learn specific hunting styles to defeat particular quarries.
        Choose one hunting style from the list below.
        You can also spend \glossterm{insight points} to learn one additional \textit{hunting style} per \glossterm{insight point}.
        When you use your \textit{quarry} ability, you may also use one of your \textit{hunting styles}.
        Each \textit{hunting style} ability lasts as long as the \textit{quarry} ability you used it with.
        {
            \begin{freeability}{Anchoring}[Magical]
                As long as your quarry is \glossterm{threatened} by at least two members of your hunting party, it cannot travel extradimensionally.
                This prevents all \glossterm{Manifestation}, \glossterm{Planar}, and \glossterm{Teleportation} effects.

    \classbasics{Alignment} Any.

    \classbasics{Archetypes} Sorcerers have the Arcane Magic, Arcane Spell Mastery, Draconic Magic, Innate Arcanist, and Wild Magic \glossterm{archetypes}.

    \subsection{Basic Class Abilities}
        If you are a sorcerer, you gain the following abilities.

        \cf{Sor}{Defenses}
        You gain the following bonuses to your \glossterm{defenses}: \plus1 Armor, \plus3 Fortitude, \plus4 Reflex, \plus7 Mental.

        \cf{Sor}{Skills}
        You have the following \glossterm{class skills}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \subparhead{Intelligence} Craft, Deduction, Knowledge (arcana, the planes), Linguistics.
            \item \subparhead{Perception} Awareness, Spellcraft.
            \item \subparhead{Other} Deception, Intimidate, Persuasion, Profession.
        \end{itemize}

        \cf{Sor}{Weapon Proficiencies} 
        You are proficient with simple weapons and any one other \glossterm{weapon group}.

        \cf{Sor}{Armor Proficiencies} 
        You are not proficient with any type of armor.
        Encumbrance from armor interferes with the gestures you make to cast spells, which can cause your spells with \glossterm{somatic components} to fail (see \pcref{Somatic Component Failure}).

    \subsection{Arcane Magic}
        This archetype grants you the ability to cast arcane spells.

        \cf{Sor}[1]{Spellcasting}[Magical]
        You have the ability to use arcane magic.
        You gain access to one arcane \glossterm{mystic sphere} (see \pcref{Arcane Mystic Spheres}).
        You may spend \glossterm{insight points} to learn one additional \glossterm{mystic sphere} per two \glossterm{insight points}.
        Each \glossterm{mystic sphere} has a set of \glossterm{spells} associated with it.

        You automatically learn all \glossterm{cantrips} from any mystic sphere you have access to.
        In addition, you learn two rank 1 \glossterm{spells} from your chosen \glossterm{mystic sphere}.
        You can also spend \glossterm{insight points} to learn one additional arcane spell per \glossterm{insight point}.
        Unless otherwise noted in a spell's description, casting a spell requires a \glossterm{standard action}.

        When you gain access to a new \glossterm{mystic sphere} or spell \glossterm{rank},
            you can exchange any number of spells you know for other spells,
            including spells of the higher rank.

        Arcane spells require both \glossterm{verbal components} and \glossterm{somatic components} to cast (see \pcref{Casting Components}).
        For details about mystic spheres and casting spells, see \pcref{Spell and Ritual Mechanics}.

        \cf{Sor}[2]{Innate Focus} You reduce your \glossterm{focus penalties} by 2.

        \cf{Sor}[3]{Spell Rank}[Magical] You become a rank 3 arcane spellcaster.
        This can improve the effectiveness of your spells and give you access to spells that require a minimum rank of 3.

        \cf{Sor}[3]{Spell} You learn an additional \glossterm{spell} for any arcane \glossterm{mystic sphere} you know.

        \cf*{Sor}[4]{Spell Rank}[Magical] You become a rank 4 arcane spellcaster.
        This can improve the effectiveness of your spells and give you access to spells that require a minimum rank of 4.

        \cf*{Sor}[5]{Spell Rank}[Magical] You become a rank 5 arcane spellcaster.
        This can improve the effectiveness of your spells and give you access to spells that require a minimum rank of 5.

        \cf*{Sor}[6]{Spell Rank}[Magical] You become a rank 6 arcane spellcaster.
        This can improve the effectiveness of your spells and give you access to spells that require a minimum rank of 6.

        \cf*{Sor}[6]{Spell} You learn an additional \glossterm{spell} for any arcane \glossterm{mystic sphere} you know.

        \cf*{Sor}[7]{Spell Rank}[Magical] You become a rank 7 arcane spellcaster.
        This can improve the effectiveness of your spells and give you access to spells that require a minimum rank of 7.

        \cf*{Sor}[8]{Spell Rank}[Magical] You become a rank 8 arcane spellcaster.
        This can improve the effectiveness of your spells and give you access to spells that require a minimum rank of 8.

    \subsection{Arcane Spell Mastery}
        This archetype improves the arcane spells you cast.
        You must have the Arcane Magic archetype from the sorcerer class to gain the abilities from this archetype.

        \cf{Sor}[1]{Mystic Insight}[Magical]
        You gain your choice of one of the following abilities.
        {
            \parhead{Focused Caster} You reduce your \glossterm{focus penalty} by 1.
                You cannot choose this ability multiple times.
            \parhead{Insight Point} You gain an additional \glossterm{insight point}.
                You can choose this ability multiple times, gaining an additional insight point each time.
            \parhead{Spell Power} Choose an arcane \glossterm{spell} you know.
                You gain a \plus2 bonus to \glossterm{power} with that spell.
                You can choose this ability multiple times, choosing a different spell each time.
            \parhead{Spell Precision} Choose an arcane \glossterm{spell} you know.
                You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with that spell.
                You can choose this ability multiple times, choosing a different spell each time.
        }

        \cf{Sor}[2]{Mage Armor}[Magical] You can use the \textit{mage armor} ability as a standard action.
        \begin{freeability}{Mage Armor}
            You create a translucent suit of magical armor on your body and over your hands.
            This functions like body armor that provides a \plus2 bonus to Armor defense and has no \glossterm{encumbrance}.
            It also provides a bonus to \glossterm{resistances} against \glossterm{energy damage} equal to 2 \add half your level.
            The body armor does not appear if you are wearing other body armor of any kind.

            As long as you have a free hand, the barrier also manifests as a shield that provides a \plus1 bonus to Armor defense.
            This bonus is considered to come from a shield, and does not stack with the benefits of using a physical shield.

            This ability lasts until you \glossterm{dismiss} it as a free action.
        \end{freeability}

        \cf{Sor}[3]{Wellspring of Power}[Magical]
        You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{power} with \glossterm{magical} abilities.

        \cf*{Sor}[4]{Mystic Insight}[Magical]
        You gain an additional \textit{mystic insight} ability.

        \cf{Sor}[5]{Greater Mage Armor}[Magical]
        The defense bonus from the body armor created by your \textit{mage armor} ability increases to \plus3.
        In addition, the bonus to \glossterm{resistances} against \glossterm{energy damage} increases to be equal to your level \add 2.

        \cf{Sor}[6]{Greater Wellspring of Power}[Magical]
        The bonus from your \textit{wellspring of power} ability increases to \plus2.

        \cf*{Sor}[7]{Mystic Insight}[Magical]
        You gain an additional \textit{mystic insight} ability.

    \subsection{Draconic Magic}
        Not all sorcerers know the reason for their innate connection to magic.
        Some discover that they have draconic blood in their veins, and some of those sorcerers learn how to tap into their heritage.
        This archetype deepens your magical connection to your draconic ancestor and enhances your spellcasting.
        You must have the Arcane Magic archetype from the sorcerer class to gain the abilities from this archetype.

        \cf{Sor}[1]{Draconic Bloodline} Choose a type of dragon from among the dragons on \trefnp{Dragon Types}.
        You have the blood of that type of dragon in your veins.
        You gain a bonus equal to your level to your \glossterm{resistances} against the damage type dealt by that dragon's breath weapon.
        In addition, you learn an additional spell from the \glossterm{mystic sphere} associated with your dragon if you have access to that mystic sphere.

        \begin{dtable}
            \lcaption{Dragon Types}
            \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{l >{\lcol}X >{\lcol}X}
                \tb{Dragon} & \tb{Damage Type} & \tb{Mystic Sphere} \tableheaderrule
                Black       & Acid             & Vivimancy    \\
                Blue        & Electricity      & Electromancy \\
                Brass       & Fire             & Delusion     \\
                Bronze      & Electricity      & Revelation   \\
                Copper      & Acid             & Terramancy   \\
                Gold        & Fire             & Photomancy   \\
                Green       & Acid             & Compulsion   \\
                Red         & Fire             & Pyromancy    \\
                Silver      & Cold             & Telekinesis  \\
                White       & Cold             & Cryomancy    \\
            \end{dtabularx}
        \end{dtable}

        \cf{Sor}[2]{Draconic Focus} You reduce your \glossterm{focus penalties} by 1.

        \cf{Sor}[3]{Draconic Precision} You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with any spell that either deals damage of your dragon's damage type or is from your dragon's \glossterm{mystic sphere}.

        \cf{Sor}[4]{Greater Draconic Bloodline} You learn an additional spell from the mystic sphere associated with your dragon.
        In addition, the bonus to \glossterm{resistances} from your \textit{draconic bloodline} ability increases to be equal to twice your level.

        \cf{Sor}[5]{Draconic Hide} You gain a \plus1 bonus to Armor and Fortitude defenses.

        \cf{Sor}[6]{Greater Draconic Precision} The bonus from your \textit{draconic precision} ability increases to \plus2.

        \cf{Sor}[7]{Supreme Draconic Bloodline} You learn an additional spell from the mystic sphere associated with your dragon.
        In addition, you treat all damage of the type your dragon resists as \glossterm{environmental damage}, preventing you from losing hit points from attacks that do not beat your \glossterm{wound resistance} (see \pcref{Environmental Damage}).

    \subsection{Innate Arcanist}
        This archetype deepens your innate connection to arcane magic.
        You must have the Arcane Magic archetype from the sorcerer class to gain the abilities from this archetype.

        \cf{Sor}[1]{Innate Magic} None of your spells have \glossterm{somatic components} or \glossterm{verbal components}.

        \cf{Sor}[2]{Mystic Tolerance} You gain a bonus to \glossterm{resistances} against \glossterm{energy damage} equal to half your level.

        \cf{Sor}[3]{Augment} You learn one \glossterm{augment} (see \pcref{Augments}).
        You can apply augments to spells to change their effects.
        When you gain access to a new arcane spell \glossterm{rank}, you may change which augments you know.

        \cf{Sor}[4]{Spell Absorption} Whenever another creature uses a spell to attack you, you gain the ability to cast the spell once.
        The spell retains its original \glossterm{augments}, if any, and you cannot apply any \glossterm{augments} to it.
        When you cast the spell, you use your own \glossterm{accuracy}, \glossterm{power}, and abilities to determine the effects of the spell.
        Once you cast the spell, you expend the absorbed energy, and you cannot cast it again.

        Whenever you are attacked by a new spell, if you already have the ability to cast a spell with this ability, you choose which spell you gain the ability to cast.
        When you take a \glossterm{long rest}, you lose the ability to cast any spells you have stored with this ability.

        \cf{Sor}[5]{Greater Mystic Tolerance} The bonus from your \textit{mystic tolerance} ability increases to be equal to your level.

        \cf*{Sor}[6]{Augment} You learn an additional \glossterm{augment}.

        \cf{Sor}[7]{Greater Spell Absorption} You can store the ability to cast up to three spells with your \textit{spell absorption} ability.
        In addition, you can cast each stored spell twice before you lose the ability to cast it instead of only once.

    \subsection{Wild Magic}
        This archetype makes the magic you cast more chaotic, generally increasing its power at the cost of your control over your magic.

        \cf{Sor}[1]{Wildspell} Whenever you cast a spell that does not have the \glossterm{Attune} or \glossterm{Sustain} tags, you may use this ability after making all other decisions for the spell (such as targets, intended area, and so on).
        When you do, you gain a \plus2 bonus to \glossterm{power} with the spell.
        In addition, roll 1d10 and apply the corresponding wild magic effect from \trefnp{Wild Magic Effects}.
        Some wild magic effects cannot be meaningfully applied to all spells.
        For example, changing the damage dealt by a spell does not affect spells that do not deal damage.
        Any wildspell effects that do not make sense for a particular spell should be ignored.

        \begin{dtable}
            \lcaption{Wild Magic Effects}
            \begin{dtabularx}{\textwidth}{l X}
                \tb{Roll} & \tb{Effect} \tableheaderrule
                1 or lower & You \glossterm{miscast} the spell \\
                2 & You roll the attack roll twice for the spell and take the lower result \\
                3 & If you are a valid target for the spell, it also targets you in addition to any other targets \\
                4 & All damage dealt by the spell changes to physical damage \\
                5 & All damage dealt by the spell changes to energy damage \\
                6 & The spell's area is doubled \\
                7 & Each target \glossterm{wounded} by the spell this round is also \glossterm{dazed} as a \glossterm{condition} \\
                8 & You roll damage twice for the spell and take the higher result \\
                9 & You roll the attack roll twice for the spell and take the higher result \\
                10 or higher & During the \glossterm{action phase} of the next round, the spell takes effect again with the same choices for all decisions, such as targets \\
            \end{dtabularx}
        \end{dtable}

        \cf{Sor}[2]{Chaotic Miscast} Whenever you \glossterm{miscast} a spell for any reason other a wild magic effect, you may instead roll on the \trefnp{Wild Magic Effects} table to determine the spell's effect.
        You take a \minus5 penalty to the roll.

    \end{dtable!*}

    \classbasics{Alignment} Any.

    \classbasics{Archetypes} Warlocks have the Pact Magic, Pact Spell Mastery, and Blessings of the Abyss \glossterm{archetypes}.

    \subsection{Basic Class Abilities}
        If you are a warlock, you gain the following abilities.

        \cf{War}{Defenses}
        You gain the following bonuses to your \glossterm{defenses}: \plus2 Armor, \plus4 Fortitude, \plus3 Reflex, \plus6 Mental.

        \cf{War}{Skills}
        You have the following \glossterm{class skills}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \subparhead{Dexterity} Ride.
            \item \subparhead{Intelligence} Craft, Deduction, Disguise, Knowledge (arcana, planes, religion), Linguistics.
            \item \subparhead{Perception} Awareness, Social Insight, Spellcraft.
            \item \subparhead{Other} Deception, Intimidate, Persuasion, Profession.
        \end{itemize}

        \cf{War}{Weapon Proficiencies} 
        You are proficient with simple weapons and any one other \glossterm{weapon group}.

        \cf{War}{Armor Proficiencies} 
        You are proficient with light armor.
        Encumbrance from armor interferes with the gestures you make to cast spells, which can cause your spells with \glossterm{somatic components} to fail (see \pcref{Somatic Component Failure}).

        \cf{War}{Infernal Pact}[Magical]
        To become a warlock, you must make a pact with a powerful demon or devil.
        % TODO: wording; intended to prevent Null warlocks who have no pact
        If you somehow lose this ability, you lose all other warlock abilities.
        You must make a dark sacrifice, the details of which are subject to negotiation, and offer a part of your immortal soul.
        In exchange, you gain the powers of a warlock.
        The creature you make the pact with is called your soulkeeper.

        Offering your soul to an entity in this way grants it the ability to communicate with you in limited ways.
        This communication typically manifests as unnatural emotional urges or whispered voices audible only to you.

        Your pact specifies how much of your soul is granted to your soulkeeper, and the circumstances of the transfer.
        The most common arrangement is for a soulkeeper to gain possession of your soul immediately after you die.
        It will keep the soul for one decade per year of your life that you spend as a warlock.
        During that time, it will not prevent you from being resurrected.
        At the end of that time, if your soul remains intact, your soul will pass on to its intended afterlife.
        However, other arrangements are possible, and each warlock's pact can be unique.

        The longer you spend in an afterlife that is not your own, the more likely you are to lose your sense of self and become subsumed by the plane you are on.
        Only a soul of extraordinary strength can maintain its integrity after decades or centuries in the Abyss.
        Many warlocks seek power zealously while mortal to gain the mental fortitude necessary to keep their soul after death.

        \cf{War}{Whispers of the Lost}[Magical]
        You hear the voices of souls lost to the Abyss, linked to you through your soulkeeper.
        Choose one of the following types of whispers that you hear.
        {
            \subcf{Mentoring Whispers} You hear the voice of a dead warlock whose soul is bound to the same soulkeeper as yours.

            \subcf{Spiteful Whispers} You hear the voices of cruel souls who berate you for your flaws and mistakes.

            \subcf{Sycophantic Whispers} You hear the voices of adoring souls who praise your talents and everything you do.

            \subcf{Warning Whispers} You hear the voices of paranoid and fearful souls warning you of danger, both real and imagined.

            \subcf{Whispers of the Mighty} Your soulkeeper forges the connection to your soul into a boon granted to any soul in the Abyss strong enough to claim it in battle.
            You hear the voice of whatever soul currently possesses the boon, which may change suddenly and unexpectedly.
        }

        \end{freeability}

        \cf{War}[1]{Spellcasting}[Magical]

        You gain access to one pact \glossterm{mystic sphere} (see \pcref{Pact Mystic Spheres}).
        Each \glossterm{mystic sphere} has a set of \glossterm{spells} associated with it.
        You may spend \glossterm{insight points} to learn one additional \glossterm{mystic sphere} per two \glossterm{insight points}.

        You automatically learn all \glossterm{cantrips} from any mystic sphere you have access to.

            you can exchange any number of spells you know for other spells,

    \end{dtable!*}

    \classbasics{Alignment} Any.

    \classbasics{Archetypes} Mages have the Alchemist, Arcane Magic, Arcane Spell Mastery, and Arcane Scholar \glossterm{archetypes}.

    \subsection{Basic Class Abilities}
        If you are a wizard, you gain the following abilities.

        \cf{Wiz}{Defenses}
        You gain the following bonuses to your \glossterm{defenses}: \plus1 Armor, \plus3 Fortitude, \plus4 Reflex, \plus7 Mental.

        \cf{Wiz}{Skills}
        You have the following \glossterm{class skills}:
        \begin{itemize}

        \cf{Wiz}{Armor Proficiencies}
        You are not proficient with any type of armor.
        Encumbrance from armor interferes with the gestures you make to cast spells, which can cause your spells with \glossterm{somatic components} to fail (see \pcref{Somatic Component Failure}).

    \subsection{Alchemist}
        This archetype improves your ability to use achemy to create unusual concoctions to aid your allies and harm your foes.

        \cf{Wiz}[1]{Portable Workshop} 
        You carry materials necessary to refine low-grade alchemical items wherever you are.
        Items created with this ability deteriorate and become useless after 24 hours or after you finish a long rest, whichever comes first.
        The items are just as effective when used as items created normally.
        You can use this ability create alchemical items with a item level up to your level.

        Creating an item in this way functions in the same way as crafting alchemical items normally, with the following changes.
        First, you do not require any raw materials.
        Seond, the difficulty rating goes up by 5 after each successful craft.
        Third, if you fail to craft an item in this way, you cannot try again until you destroy all items crafted with this ability and finish a short rest.

        If you use this ability extensively without visiting civilization or some other area where you can restock your personal supplies for weeks, you may run low on supplies and your ability to use this ability may be limited.

        \cf{Wiz}[2]{Alchemical Infusion} Whenever you create or use an alchemical item, you may use your \glossterm{power} with \glossterm{magical} abilities in place of the item's normal power to determine its effects.

        \cf{Wiz}[3]{Alchemical Discovery} You gain your choice of one of the following benefits.
        {
            \parhead{Complex Construction} You can use your portable workshop ability to create items with an item level up to two levels higher than your level.
            \parhead{Durable Construction} You double the range of alchemical items you create.
            \parhead{Efficient Crafting} It takes you half the normal time and material components to craft alchemical items.
            \parhead{Explosive Construction} You double the area affected by alchemical items you create.
            \parhead{Potent Construction} Alchemical items you create gain a \plus2 bonus to power.
            \parhead{Repetitive Construction} Whenever you use your portable workshop ability, you can create two copies of the same alchemical item.
            This only counts as one item for the purpose of determining the increase to your crafting difficulty.
            \parhead{Safe Construction} Creatures who are not trained in Craft (alchemy) can use alchemical items you create without a mishap chance.
        }

        \cf{Wiz}[4]{Alchemical Expertise} You gain a \plus3 bonus to the Craft (alchemy) skill and a \plus1 bonus to accuracy with alchemical items.

        \cf{Wiz}[5]{Experienced Quaffing} You can drink up to two doses of potions, elixirs, and other drinkable alchemical items simultaneously with no mishap risk.

        \cf*{Wiz}[6]{Alchemical Discovery} You gain an additional \textit{alchemical discovery} ability.

        \cf{Wiz}[7]{Greater Alchemical Expertise} The skill bonus from your \textit{alchemical expertise} ability increses to \plus6 and the accuracy bonus increases to \plus2.

    \subsection{Arcane Magic}

        You must have an base Intelligence of at least 1 to gain this archetype.

        \cf{Wiz}[1]{Spellcasting}[Magical]
        You have the ability to use arcane magic.
        You gain access to one arcane \glossterm{mystic sphere} (see \pcref{Arcane Mystic Spheres}).
        You may spend \glossterm{insight points} to learn one additional \glossterm{mystic sphere} per two \glossterm{insight points}.
        Each \glossterm{mystic sphere} has a set of \glossterm{spells} associated with it.

        You automatically learn all \glossterm{cantrips} from any mystic sphere you have access to.
        In addition, you learn two rank 1 \glossterm{spells} from your chosen \glossterm{mystic sphere}.
        You can also spend \glossterm{insight points} to learn one additional arcane spell per \glossterm{insight point}.
        Unless otherwise noted in a spell's description, casting a spell requires a \glossterm{standard action}.

        When you gain access to a new \glossterm{mystic sphere} or spell \glossterm{rank},
            you can exchange any number of spells you know for other spells,
            including spells of the higher rank.

        Arcane spells require both \glossterm{verbal components} and \glossterm{somatic components} to cast (see \pcref{Casting Components}).
        For details about mystic spheres and casting spells, see \pcref{Spell and Ritual Mechanics}.

        \cf{Wiz}[2]{Mystic Sphere} You gain access to an additional arcane \glossterm{mystic sphere}, including all \glossterm{cantrips} from that sphere.
        In addition, you learn an additional arcane \glossterm{spell}.

        \cf{Wiz}[3]{Spell Rank}[Magical] You become a rank 3 arcane spellcaster.
        This can improve the effectiveness of your spells and give you access to spells that require a minimum rank of 3.

        \cf*{Wiz}[4]{Spell Rank}[Magical] You become a rank 4 arcane spellcaster.
        This can improve the effectiveness of your spells and give you access to spells that require a minimum rank of 4.

        \cf*{Wiz}[8]{Spell Rank}[Magical] You become a rank 8 arcane spellcaster.
        This can improve the effectiveness of your spells and give you access to spells that require a minimum rank of 8.

    \subsection{Arcane Scholar}
        This archetype deepens your study of arcane magic.
        You have the Arcane Magic archetype from the wizard class to gain the abilities from this archetype.

        \cf{Wiz}[1]{Scholastic Lore} You gain a \plus2 bonus to the Spellcraft skill and all Knowledge skills.

        \cf{Wiz}[2]{Ritualist} You gain the ability to perform arcane rituals to create unique magical effects (see \pcref{Rituals}).
        The maximum \glossterm{rank} of arcane ritual you can learn or perform is equal to the maximum rank of arcane spell that you can cast.
        In addition, whenever you gain access to a new spell rank, you can scribe one ritual of that rank or lower without paying the normal costs.

        \cf{Wiz}[3]{Arcane Insight}[Magical]
        You gain one of the following insights.
        Some insights can be chosen multiple times, as indicated in their descriptions.

        {
            \parhead{Expanded Sphere Access} You gain access to a new \glossterm{mystic sphere}.
            \par You cannot choose this insight multiple times.

            \parhead{Expanded Spell Knowledge} You learn an additional \glossterm{spell}.
            \par You can choose this insight multiple times, learning an additional spell each time.

            \parhead{Signature Spell} Choose a \glossterm{spell} you know.
            The spell loses the \glossterm{Focus} tag, allowing you to cast it without lowering your guard in combat.
            \par If you choose this insight multiple times, you must choose a different \glossterm{spell} each time.

            \parhead{Sphere Specialization} Choose a a \glossterm{mystic sphere} you have access to.
            You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with abilities from that \glossterm{mystic sphere}.
            In addition, you learn an additional \glossterm{spell} from that \glossterm{mystic sphere}.
            In exchange, you must lose access to another \glossterm{mystic sphere} you have.
            You must exchange all spells you know from that \glossterm{mystic sphere} with spells from other \glossterm{mystic spheres} you have access to.
            \par You cannot choose this insight multiple times.

            \parhead{Memorized Sphere} % TODO: clarify you need to be high enough rank?
            Choose a \glossterm{mystic sphere} you have access to.
            You can perform rituals from that \glossterm{mystic sphere} without having them written in your ritual book.
            If you lead a ritual from that \glossterm{mystic sphere}, it requires half the normal amount of time to perform and costs half the normal number of \glossterm{action points} (minimum 1).
            \par You can choose this insight multiple times, choosing a different \glossterm{mystic sphere} each time.
        }

        \cf{Wiz}[4]{Greater Scholastic Lore} The bonuses from your \textit{scholastic lore} ability increase to \plus4.

        \cf{Wiz}[5]{Contingency}  You learn the Contingency \glossterm{augment}, allowing you to prepare a spell so it takes effect automatically if specific circumstances arise.
        Applying the Contingency \glossterm{augment} increases the \glossterm{rank} of the spell and all its upgrades by 2.
        % If any spells take more than one standard action, they would need to be excluded from Contingency, but none exist
        % You can apply this augment to any arcane spell that can be cast as a \glossterm{standard action} or \glossterm{minor action}.

        Casting a spell with the Contingency augment takes 5 minutes.
        When the casting is complete, the spell has no immediate effect.
        Instead, it automatically takes effect when some specific circumstances arise.
        During the time required to cast the spell, you specify what circumstances cause the spell to take effect.

        The spell can be set to trigger in response to any circumstances that a typical human observing you and your situation could detect.
        For example, you could specify ``when I fall at least 50 feet'' or ``when I take a \glossterm{vital wound}'', but not ``when there is an invisible creature within 50 feet of me'' or ``when I have only one \glossterm{hit point} remaining.''
        The more specific the required circumstances, the better -- vague requirements, such as ``when I am in danger'', may cause the spell to trigger unexpectedly or fail to trigger at all.
        If you attempt to specify multiple separate triggering conditions, such as ``when I take damage or when an enemy is adjacent to me'', the spell will randomly ignore all but one of the conditions.

        If the spell needs to be targeted, the trigger condition can specify a simple rule for identifying how to target the spell, such as ``the closest enemy''.
        If the rule is poorly worded or imprecise, the spell may target incorrectly or fail to activate at all.
        Any spells which require decisions, such as the \spell{dimension door} spell, must have those decisions made at the time it is cast.
        You cannot alter those decisions when the contingency takes effect.

        You can have only one spell with this augment active at a time.
        If you use the augment again with a different spell, the old contingency is removed.

        \cf*{Wiz}[6]{Arcane Insight}[Magical]
        You learn an additional \textit{arcane insight}.

        \cf{Wiz}[7]{Malleable Contingency} If you have a \textit{contingency} active, you can change the conditions to trigger your \textit{contingency} as a standard action.
        This does not allow you to change the spell stored in your \textit{contingency}.

    \subsection{Arcane Spell Mastery}
        This archetype improves the arcane spells you cast.
        You must have the Arcane Magic archetype from the wizard class to gain the abilities from this archetype.

        \cf{Wiz}[1]{Mystic Insight}[Magical]
        You gain your choice of one of the following abilities.
        {
            \parhead{Focused Caster} You reduce your \glossterm{focus penalty} by 1.
                You cannot choose this ability multiple times.
            \parhead{Insight Point} You gain an additional \glossterm{insight point}.
                You can choose this ability multiple times, gaining an additional insight point each time.
            \parhead{Rituals} You gain the ability to perform arcane rituals to create unique magical effects (see \pcref{Rituals}).
                The maximum \glossterm{rank} of arcane ritual you can learn or perform is equal to the maximum rank of arcane spell that you can cast.
                You cannot choose this ability multiple times.
            \parhead{Spell Power} Choose an arcane \glossterm{spell} you know.
                You gain a \plus2 bonus to \glossterm{power} with that spell.
                You can choose this ability multiple times, choosing a different spell each time.
            \parhead{Spell Precision} Choose an arcane \glossterm{spell} you know.
                You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with that spell.
                You can choose this ability multiple times, choosing a different spell each time.
        }

        \cf{Wiz}[2]{Mage Armor}[Magical] You can use the \textit{mage armor} ability as a standard action.
        \begin{freeability}{Mage Armor}
            You create a translucent suit of magical armor on your body and over your hands.
            This functions like body armor that provides a \plus2 bonus to Armor defense and has no \glossterm{encumbrance}.
            It also provides a bonus to \glossterm{resistances} against \glossterm{energy damage} equal to half your level.
            The body armor does not appear if you are wearing other body armor of any kind.

            As long as you have a free hand, the barrier also manifests as a shield that provides a \plus1 bonus to Armor defense.
            This bonus is considered to come from a shield, and does not stack with the benefits of using a physical shield.

            This ability lasts until you \glossterm{dismiss} it as a free action.
        \end{freeability}

        \cf{Wiz}[3]{Wellspring of Power}[Magical]
        You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{power} with \glossterm{magical} abilities.

        \cf*{Wiz}[7]{Mystic Insight}[Magical]
