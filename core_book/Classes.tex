\chapter{Classes}\label{Classes}

Your character's class represents the things your character has chosen to train in.
This choice determines a great deal about your character's abilities.

\section{How Classes Work}
    When you first create a character, you choose a class.
    You gain all abilities granted by the \glossterm{archetypes} of your chosen class at the levels indicated in the archetype's description (see Archetypes, below).
    As you gain levels, you gain more abilities from your class.

    \subsection{Archetypes}\label{Archetypes}
        Each class has three \glossterm{archetypes}.
        An archetype is a collection of thematically related class abilities.
        For examples, barbarians have the Battlerager archetype, which grants abilities related to flying into a rage in combat.
        Normally, a member of a class has all three archetypes associated with that class.
        Characters with the Class Versatility feat can gain achetypes from two different classes (see \featpcref{Class Versatility}).

\section{Class Introductions}

    There are eleven classes in Rise.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Barbarians are mighty warriors who can enter a deadly battlerage.
        \item Clerics are divine spellcasters who draw power from their veneration of a deity or ideal.
        \item Druids are nature spellcasters who draw power from their veneration of the natural world.
        \item Fighters are highly disciplined warriors who excel in physical combat of any variety.
        \item Mages are arcane spellcasters who wield the mystic forces of magic to create almost any effect.
        \item Monks are agile masters of ``\ki'' who hone their personal abilities to strike down foes and perform supernatural feats.
        \item Paladins are divinely empowered warriors whose devotion to an alignment grants them the ability to discern and smite their foes.
        \item Rangers are skilled hunters who bridge the divide between nature and civilization.
        \item Rogues are exceptionally skillful characters known for their ability to strike at their foe's weak points in combat.
            % \item Spellwarped wield a unique blend of martial skill and narrowly focused magical abilities.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Class Description Format}
        Each class is described from the perspective of a member of that class, using ``you'' in the description.

        \parhead{Class Table}
        The class's table describes the special abilities a member of that class gains at each level, assuming they have all of that class's \glossterm{archetypes}.

        \parhead{Alignment}
        Some classes require specific alignments (see \pcref{Alignment}).
        Most classes allow characters of any alignment.

        \parhead{Skills}
        Each class has specific \glossterm{skills} that members of that class are typically good at (see \pcref{Skills}).
        These skills are called \glossterm{class skills}.
        You gain a certain number of skill points depending on the class which can only be spent on class skills for that class.

        \parhead{Defenses}
        Each class grants bonuses to specific defenses.

        \parhead{Weapon and Armor Proficiencies}
        These are the types of equipment that members of this class are trained in using.

        \parhead{Other Special Abilities}
        Some classes have abilities shared by all members of the class that are not part of an archetype, such as a cleric's \textit{divine power}.

        \parhead{Archetypes}
        The abilities associated with each of the three archetypes the class has.

    \subsection{Spellcasting}

        \cf{Clr}{Divine Spells} 
        Your deity grants you the ability to cast divine spells.
        You learn two divine spells from the divine \glossterm{spell list} (see \pcref{Divine Spells}).
        Your \glossterm{spellpower} with divine spells is equal to your \textit{divine power}.

        To cast a spell, you must normally spend an \glossterm{action point}.
        Every spell can also be cast as a cantrip.
        Cantrips are weaker, but do not require action points to cast.

        You can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to your deity's.
        Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the \glossterm{Chaos}, \glossterm{Good}, \glossterm{Evil}, and \glossterm{Law} tags in their spell descriptions.

        \cf{Clr}{Rituals} 
        You can perform divine rituals to create unique magical effects (see \pcref{Rituals}).

        \cf{Clr}[6]{Augments}
        Choose two \glossterm{augments} (see \pcref{Augments}).

                        \spellsuccess The target takes an evil action as soon as it can.
                        You have no control over the act the creature takes, but circumstances can make the target more likely to take an action you desire.
                    \end{spellattack}

                    \spelleffect You can speak with and command fire within range.
                    You can ask the fire simple questions and understand its responses.
                    If you command the fire to perform a task, it will do so do the best of its ability until this effect ends.
                    You cannot compel the fire to move farther than 30 feet in a single round.
                    Fire that ends the round on non-combustable materials usually goes out, depending on the circumstances.

            \parhead{Gift} Whenever an adjacent creature takes damage, you may use this ability.
            If you do, you take half of that damage (rounded down) instead of the creature.
            Any abilities you have that would make the attack miss or fail have no effect, but your abilities that allow you to reduce or ignore its effects work normally.
            The protected creature takes the remaining half of the damage, and suffers any non-damaging effects of the attack normally.
            \par You may learn which attacks hit you and your allies in the current phase before deciding which attacks to redirect damage from, but not how much damage they would do (or any other effects they might have).
            \parhead{Aspect} You can use this domain's domain gift to redirect damage from any creature within \rngclose range.

                        You have no control over the act the creature takes, but circumstances can make the target more likely to take an action you desire.

                    The target also learns the results of your check.
                    It believes the information gained in this way to be true as if it had seen it with its own eyes.
                    \par You cannot alter the knowledge you gain with this check in any way, such as by adding or withholding information.

                        The laws which are applied are those which are most appropriate for the area, regardless of whether the cleric or any other creature know those laws.
                        In areas under ambiguous or nonexistent government, this ability may have unexpected effects, or it may have no effect at all.

            \parhead{Aspect} All of your \glossterm{magical} spells and abilities can heal \glossterm{vital damage} as easily as they heal hit points.

            \end{ability}
            \parhead{Mastery} Whenever you move, you can teleport the same distance instead.

                    The belief may be a lie that you told it, or even a simple misunderstanding (such as believing a hidden creature is not present in a room).
                    If the creature does not already hold the chosen belief, this ability automatically fails.

                        It will interpret any evidence that the falsehood is incorrect to be somehow wrong -- an illusion, a conspiracy to decieve it, or any other reason it can think of to continue believing the falsehood.
                        At the end of the effect, the creature can decide whether it believes the falsehood or not, as normal.

            \parhead{Aspect} You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with \glossterm{physical attacks}.
            \parhead{Essence} Whenever you cast a spell, you can use this ability as an \glossterm{immediate action} by spending an \glossterm{action point}.
            If you do, the spell gains one of the following effects:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Legion: If the spell would normally affect five or more specific targets it instead affects five times that many targets.
                \item Selective: If the spell has an area, it has no effect on your allies in the area.
                \item Widened: If the spell has an area, the size of the area is doubled.

            \end{ability}
            \parhead{Mastery}
            Whenever you move, you can transform yourself into a rushing flow of water with a volume roughly equal to your normal volume until your movement is complete
            In this form, you may move wherever water could go, you cannot take other actions, such as jumping, attacking, or casting spells.
            You may move through squares occupied by creatures or threatened by blocking enemies without penalty.
            \par Your speed is halved when moving uphill and doubled when moving downhill.
            Unusually steep inclines may cause greater movement differences while in this form.
            \par If the water is split, you may reform from anywhere the water has reached, to as little as a single ounce of water.
            If not even an ounce of water exists contiguously, your body reforms from all of the largest available sections of water, cut into pieces of appropriate size.
            This usually causes you to die.

        \subsubsection{Wild}
            \parhead{Gift} You add Creature Handling, Knowledge (nature), and Survival to your cleric class skill list.
            In addition, you gain two skill points which must be spent on any combination of those skills.

            \parhead{Aspect} When you gain this ability, you choose one wild aspect ability, as if you were a druid of a level equal to your cleric level (see Wild Aspect, \pref{Drd:Wild Aspect}).
            As a standard action, you can spend an \glossterm{action point} to embody that wild aspect for 1 hour.

        \subsubsection{Ex-Clerics}
            If you grossly violate the code of conduct required by your deity, you lose all spells and magical cleric class abilities.
            You cannot regain those abilities until you atone for your transgressions to your deity.

    \classbasics{Alignment} Neutral good, lawful neutral, neutral, chaotic neutral, or neutral evil.

    \classbasics{Archetypes} Druids have the Spellcasting, Natural Influence, and Nature Spell Mastery \glossterm{archetypes}.

    \subsection{Basic Class Abilities}
        If you are a druid, you gain the following abilities.

        \cf{Drd}{Defenses}
        You gain the following bonuses to your \glossterm{defenses}: \plus3 Fortitude, \plus2 Mental, and \plus1 Reflex.

        \cf{Drd}{Skills}
        You have the following \glossterm{class skills}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \subparhead{Strength} Climb, Jump, Sprint, Swim.
            \item \subparhead{Dexterity} Acrobatics, Ride, Stealth.
            \item \subparhead{Intelligence} Heal, Knowledge (geography, nature).
            \item \subparhead{Perception} Awareness, Creature Handling, Survival.
            \item \subparhead{Other} Bluff, Intimidate, Persuasion.
        \end{itemize}
        You gain 6 \glossterm{skill points} which can only be spent on those class skills.

        \cf{Drd}{Weapon and Armor Proficiencies}
        Druids are proficient with simple weapons, any one other weapon group, scimitars, sickles, and slings.
        In addition, druids are proficient with light armor, medium armor, and shields.
        However, a druid cannot use metal armor; see the Metal Abhorrence ability, below.

        \cf{Drd}{Druidic Language}
        You know Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, in addition to your normal languages.
        Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.
        Druidic has its own alphabet.

        \cf{Drd}{Metal Abhorrence}
        The oaths that you swear as part of your druidic initiation prohibit you from wearing armor made of metal.
        If you wear prohibited armor or carry a prohibited shield, you are unable to cast druid spells or use any of your \glossterm{magical} druid abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.

        You can avoid this penalty by using armor made of wood altered with the \ritual{ironwood} ritual.
        Such wood is as strong as steel.

        \cf{Drd}{Nature Power}
        The \glossterm{power} of many druid spells and abilities is determined by your \textit{nature power}.
        Your \textit{nature power} is equal to your level or your Perception, whichever is higher.

    \subsection{Spellcasting}

        \cf{Drd}{Nature Spells} 
        Your worship of nature grants you the ability to cast nature spells.
        You learn two nature spells from the nature \glossterm{spell list} (see \pcref{Nature Spells}).
        Your \glossterm{spellpower} with nature spells is equal to your \textit{nature power}.

        To cast a spell, you must normally spend an \glossterm{action point}.
        Every spell can also be cast as a cantrip.
        Cantrips are weaker, but do not require action points to cast.

        You can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to your own or your deity's.
        Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the \glossterm{Chaos}, \glossterm{Good}, \glossterm{Evil}, and \glossterm{Law} tags in their spell descriptions.

        \cf{Drd}{Rituals} 
        You can perform nature rituals to create unique magical effects (see \pcref{Rituals}).
        You have a ritual book containing one nature ritual of your choice (see \pcref{Nature Rituals}).

        \cf{Drd}[6]{Augments}
        Choose two \glossterm{augments} (see \pcref{Augments}).
        You can apply those augments to nature spells you cast and nature rituals you perform.
        At 10th level and 14th level, you learn an additional augment.

        \cf*{Drd}[8]{Spell Knowledge}
        You learn an additional nature spell (see \pcref{Nature Spells}).

        \cf*{Drd}[16]{Spell Point} 
        You gain a spell point.
        A spell point can be spent to cast spells in place of an action point.
        You recover all spent spell points after a \glossterm{short rest}.

    \subsection{Natural Influence}

        \cf{Drd}{Wild Speech}[Magical] As a standard action, you can spend an \glossterm{action point} to use this ability.
        \begin{ability}
            \begin{spelltargetinginfo}
                \spellquicktargeting{One animal}{\rngmed}
            \end{spelltargetinginfo}
            \begin{spelleffects}
                \spelleffect You can speak to and understand the speech of the target animal, and any other animals of the same species.
                This ability doesn't make the target any more friendly or cooperative than normal.
                Wary and cunning animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while stupid ones tend to make inane comments and are unlikely to say or understand anything of use.
                \spelldur Sustain (minor)
            \end{spelleffects}
        \end{ability}

        \cf{Drd}[2]{Natural Lore}
        You gain two extra skill points which must be spent on the Creature Handling, Heal, Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (nature), Ride, or Survival skills.

        \cf{Drd}[3]{Wild Aspect}[Magical]
        You gain the ability to embody an aspect of an animal or of nature itself.
        Choose a single wild aspect from the list below.
        Many wild aspects have a minimum level prerequisite, as indicated in the title of the ability.
        That ability is normally active.
        You may suppress or resume the effects of any number of \textit{wild aspects} you have as a \glossterm{minor action}.

        The abilities in the list below describe the effects of the aspect.
        Your appearance also changes to match the aspect's effects, but the nature of this change is not described.
        Different druids change in different ways.
        For example, one druid might gain unusually large eyes when embodying the low-light vision aspect, while another might change their irises into slits, like a cat, when embodying the same aspect.
        You choose how your appearance changes when you gain a wild aspect.
        This change cannot be used to gain an additional substantive benefit beyond the effects given in the description of the aspect.

        Many wild aspects grant natural weapons.
        See \pcref{Natural Weapons}, for details about natural weapons.
        At 7th level, and every four levels thereafter, you gain an additional wild aspect.

        Your head transforms, allowing you to perform a gore attack.
        The attack deals \plus0d damage for a Medium druid.

        \subcf{Senses}
        You gain low-light vision.
        You treat sources of light as if they had double their normal illumination range.
        If you already have low-light vision, you double its benefit, allowing you to treat sources of light as if they had four times their normal illumination range.
        In addition, you gain \glossterm{darkvision} out to 50 feet, allowing you to see in complete darkness.
        If you already have darkvision, you increase its range by 50 feet.
        \subcf{Woodland Stride}
        You may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at your normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.
        The plants bend of their own volition to allow the druid to pass.
        However, plants magically manipulated to impede motion still affect your movement.

        \subcf{7th -- A Thousand Faces}
        You may use your spellpower in place of your Disguise skill when making Disguise checks to alter your own appearance.
        \subcf{7th -- Constrict}

        You gain a \plus2 bonus to accuracy with grapple attacks (see \pcref{Grapple}).
        In addition, you gain a constrict attack.
        This attack deals \plus1d damage for a Medium druid, but it can only be used against a foe you aregrappling with.
        \subcf{7th -- Hawk}
        You grow wings, granting your a glide speed equal to your land speed.
        See \pcref{Gliding}, for more details.

        The attack deals \minus1d damage for a Medium creature.
        \subcf{7th -- Lope}
        You gain the ability to move on all four limbs.
        When doing so, you gain a \plus30 foot bonus to your land speed, up to a maximum of double your original speed.
        When not using your hands to move, your ability to use your hands is unchanged.
        Descending to four legs and rising up to stand on two legs again does not take an action.
        \subcf{7th -- Scent}
        You gain the \glossterm{scent} ability.
        \subcf{7th -- Shrink}
        You shrink by one size category (see \pcref{Size in Combat}).

        \subcf{7th -- Slither}

        % \subcf{7th -- Spikes}
        % Whenever a creature adjacent to the druid makes a physical attack against you, the attacking creature takes 1d4 piercing damage \plus1d per two nature power.
        % A creature can only be dealt damage by this effect once per round.

        % Is this how poison actually works?

        % \subcf{11th -- Elemental Retribution}
        % Whenever a creature within \rngmed range of you attacks you, the attacking creature takes 1d6 damage per two nature power of either cold, electricity, or fire damage.
        % You may choose the damage type independently for each attacking creature.
        % A creature can only be dealt damage by this effect once per round.
        \subcf{11th -- Beetle's Carapace} You gain a \plus1 bonus to Armor defense.
        \subcf{11th -- Fluid Motion} You are immune to effects that restrict your mobility, and you suffer no penalties for acting underwater.
        In addition, you gain a \plus10 bonus to Reflex defense against grapple attacks, as well as on grapple attacks or Escape Artist checks made to escape a grapple or a pin.
        \subcf{11th -- Grow}
        You increase in size by one size category (see \pcref{Size in Combat}).
        This is a \glossterm{Sizing} effect.
        \subcf{11th -- Natural Grab}
        If you hit with a natural attack, you may attempt to grapple your foe as an immediate action.
        \subcf{11th -- Natural Trip}
        If you hit with a natural attack, you may attempt to trip your foe as an immediate action.
        \subcf{11th -- Wolfpack}
        You increase your \glossterm{threat value} by 1.
        \subcf{11th -- Venom}
        If you hit with a natural attack, you may inject poison into your foe as an immediate action.
        This is a \glossterm{condition}, and lasts until removed.
        At the end of each \glossterm{action phase}, you make a \textit{nature power} vs. Fortitude attack against all creatures you have poisoned.
        The effects of the poison are described below.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item First success: the target is \sickened until the effect ends.
            \item Second success: the target is \staggered until the end of the next round.
            \item Third success: the target is \nauseated until the effect ends.
            \item Third failure: the target is no longer poisoned, and any lingering effects from the poison end.
        \end{itemize}
        % TODO poison stacking rules
        \par In addition, you gains a bite attack that deals \plus0d damage for a Medium druid.

        \subcf{15th -- Natural Renewal}
        At the end of each \glossterm{action phase}, you heal hit points equal to your \textit{nature power}.
        \subcf{15th -- Stable Foundation} As long as you are on solid ground, you gain a \plus1 bonus to all defenses.
        \subcf{15th -- Wings}
        You grow wings, granting you a \glossterm{fly speed} equal to your land speed.
        While \glossterm{unencumbered}, you can fly (see \pcref{Flying}).
        % TODO: standard flight limitation

        \subcf{19th -- Solar Radiance}
        The druid continuously radiates bright light out to a 500 foot radius (and shadowy illumination for an additional 500 feet).
        The illumination is so bright that you become hard to look at.
        Any creature making a \glossterm{strike} against you from within the radius of bright light becomes \dazzled as a \glossterm{condition} after the attack.

        \cf{Drd}[5]{Natural Vigor}
        At the end of each \glossterm{action phase}, you heal hit points equal to half your \textit{nature power}.

        \cf*{Drd}[9]{Natural Lore}
        You gain two extra skill points which must be spent on the Creature Handling, Heal, Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (nature), Ride, or Survival skills.

        \cf{Drd}[13]{Greater Natural Vigor}
        Your healing from the \textit{natural vigor} ability increases to be equal to your \textit{nature power}.

        \cf{Drd}[17]{Nature's Champion}

        \cf{Drd}[20]{Avatar of Nature}[Magical]
        If you die, except if by old age, you may choose to have your body and soul become an instrument of nature's will.
        Your body immediately decomposes or otherwise disappears, and your soul does not travel to an afterlife.
        You has no physical form, and cannot use any of your normal abilities.
        Instead, you have a fly speed of 100 feet, with special maneuverability.
        As a standard action, you can temporarily possess any living plants or animals within a 10 mile radius of the place of your death.

        While possessing a living plant or animal, you can see through its senses and control its actions completely.
        In addition, you may cast spells, and the spells take effect as if the plant or animal had cast them.
        You use the plant or animal's position to determine range, visible targets, and so on.
        You do not require verbal or somatic components to cast your spells in this form.
        % TODO: are there any spells or rituals that have material components or focus objects?
        % but are unable to cast spells or perform rituals that require material components or focus objects.

        While not possessing a plant or animal, you can rest, or you can focus on reincarnating your physical form.
        Creating a new body in this way takes 12 consecutive hours of concentration.
        At the end of that time, you are reincarnated in a new body in your location, as the effect of the \ritual{reincarnation} ritual, except that you can choose your race from among the races listed (not including the ``Other'' race).

        While you are an avatar of nature, you do not age and you cannot die of old age.
        You can continue to exist in this form indefinitely.

    \subsection{Nature Spell Mastery}
        You must have the ability to cast nature spells to gain these abilities.

        \cf{Drd}[2]{Spell Point}
        You gain a spell point.
        A spell point can be spent to cast spells in place of an action point.
        You recover all spent spell points after a \glossterm{short rest}.

        \cf{Drd}[3]{Spell Knowledge} 
        You learn an additional nature spell (see \pcref{Nature Spells}).

        \cf{Drd}[4]{Subspells}
        Choose two \glossterm{subspells} for nature spells you know.
        You can use those subspells when you cast those spells (see \pcref{Subspells}).
        At 6th level, and every two levels thereafter, you learn an additional subspell for a nature spell you know.

        % \subcf{15th -- Air Mantle}
        % You are surrounded by a mantle of air.
        % Thrown and projectile weapons have a 50\% chance to miss your while this effect is active.
        % Unusually large weapons, such as a giant's boulders, may suffer a decreased miss chance as appropriate to their size.
        % \subcf{15th -- Aqueous Step}
        % Wherever the druid moves, you leave a path of animated water that can grab creatures.
        % Whenever a creature crosses the path, the druid makes a Reflex attack to trip the creature, causing it to fall prone and waste the rest of its movement.
        % Your accuracy is equal to your druid level \add your Constitution.
        % \subcf{15th -- Flaming Step}
        % Wherever the druid moves, you leave a path of burning flame behind your that lasts for 1 round.
        % Whenever a creature crosses the path, the druid makes a Reflex attack to deal damage to the creature.
        % The attack deals 1d8 points of fire damage per two druid levels.
        % Your accuracy is equal to your druid level \add your Constitution.
        % A failed attack deals half damage.
        % \subcf{15th -- Lifegiving Step}
        % Wherever the druid moves, you leave a path of small, living plants that entangle foes for 1 round.
        % Whenever a creature crosses the path, the druid makes a Reflex attack to entangle the creature, causing it to waste the rest of its movement.
        % Your accuracy is equal to your druid level \add your Constitution.
        % The plants appear on any surface, and will continue to grow if they can survive, though they may die quickly if they appear on inhospitable terrain.
        % \subcf{17th -- Flaming Soul}
        % You gain the fire subtype, making your immune to fire but giving your a 50\% vulnerability to cold damage.
        % In addition, whenever you deal fire damage to a creature, the creature is \ignited for 5 rounds.
        % \subcf{17th -- Sunblessed Rejuvenation}
        % You gain fast healing equal to your druid level as long as you remain in sunlight or touches a plant of your size or larger.
        % \subcf{17th -- Sunscour}
        % This aspect functions like the heart of the sun natural aspect, except that it also suppresses shadow effects and the visual components of illusions within the area of bright light.

        % \subcf{17th -- Water's Flow}
        % As a minor action, the druid can transform herself into a rushing flow of water with a volume roughly equal to your normal volume until the end of your turn.
        % In this form, she may move wherever water could go, but she cannot take other actions, such as jumping, attacking, or casting spells.
        % Your speed is halved when moving uphill and doubled when moving downhill.
        % She may move through squares occupied by creatures or threatened by blocking enemies without penalty.
        % She may return to your normal form as a free action.
        % \par If the water is split, she may reform from anywhere the water has reached, to as little as a single ounce of water.
        % If not even an ounce of water exists contiguously, your body reforms from the largest available parts of water, cut into pieces of appropriate size.
        % This usually causes the druid to die.

    \subsection{Ex-Druids}
        A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and magical druid class abilities.
        She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until you atone for your transgressions.

        % \subsection{Variant Druids}

        %     \subsubsection{Blighter}

        %         Blighters draw power from nature, as do other druids. However, while other druids revere nature and draw power from it gently, blighters steal power from nature forcefully. Wherever a blighter goes, destruction and death surely follows.

        %         \altcf{Blight} Instead of meditating to regain spell slots, a blighter draws power from your environment forcefully.
        %         This affects a \areahuge radius zone centered on your, and the process takes 1 minute of concentration.
        %         At the end of every round, every living thing in the area other than the blighter takes damage equal to your nature power.
        %         All inanimate plants of Huge size or smaller immediately wither and die.
        %         The earth becomes cracked and infertile, and any nutrients from the soil are destroyed.
        %         This ability has no effect on artificial environments or materials, such as metal or worked stone.
        %         At the end of the minute, the blighter regains your spent nature spell slots.

        %         A blighter can only blight your surroundings in this way once per hour.
        %         If your surroundings are already blighted or are not natural terrain, she cannot use this ability to regain your spells.
        %         Instead, she must meditate for 8 hours to slowly draw power from your surroundings, as a normal druid.

        %         \altcf{Spells} As normal, except that a blighter adds all Vivimancy arcane spells to your spell list.

        %         \altcf[2]{Wild Speech} As normal, except that a blighter gains a \plus5 bonus to Intimidate against your wild speech targets, and a \minus5 penalty to Persuasion.

        %         \altcf[10]{Blightcasting}

        %         \altcf[20]{Improved Blightcasting}

        % \subsubsection{Rotbringer}

        %     While most druids seek to emulate and interact with animals, rotbringers focus on the power of fungi, decay, and regeneration.

        %     \altcf{Invoke Rot} Instead of meditating to regain spell slots, a rotbringer accelerates the natural forces of decomposition and decay on your environment.
        %     This affects a \areahuge radius zone centered on your, and the process takes 1 minute of concentration.
        %     All organic objects of Huge size or smaller, such as plants and corpses, decompose.
        %     This decomposition kills inanimate, living plants.
        %     All organic objects, regardless of size, are covered with various fungi.
        %     This ability has no effect on artificial environments or materials, such as metal or worked stone.
        %     At the end of the minute, the rotbringer regains your spent nature spell slots.

        %     If the rotbringer decomposes a Huge object with this ability, or a combination of smaller objects equivalent in size to a Huge object, you gain an bonus nature spell slot of your highest available spell level.
        %     This extra spell slot lasts until it is used, or until you regain your spell slots again.

        %     A rotbringer can only invoke rot on your surroundings in this way once per hour.
        %     If your surroundings are already decomposed or are not natural terrain, she cannot use this ability to regain your spells.
        %     Instead, she must meditate for 8 hours to slowly draw power from your surroundings, as a normal druid.

        %     \altcf[2]{Wild Speech} The rotbringer gains the ability to speak with plants at 2nd level.
        %     You gain the ability to speak with animals at 6th level, instead of at 2nd level.

        %     \altcf[3rd]{Wild Aspect} The rotbringer does not gain this ability.

        %     \altcf[3rd]{Rot Spell} The druid learns an additional spell slot and spell known.
        %     The spell must be taken from the following list of spells.
        %     The spell's level cannot exceed half your druid level.
        %     If she already knows a spell from the list at every spell level you ha access to, she may instead learn any nature spell (see \pcref{Nature Spells}).

        %     At 5th level, and every odd level, the druid may learn a new spell.

        %     \altcf[7]{Fungal Armor} The rotbringer becomes covered in fungus that protects your from attacks. You gain a \plus1 bonus to Armor and Fortitude defense.

        Every spell can also be cast as a cantrip.
        Cantrips are weaker, but do not require action points to cast.

        \cf{Mge}{Rituals}
        \subparhead{Sorcerer} You cannot perform arcane rituals.
        \subparhead{Wizard} You can perform arcane rituals to create unique magical effects (see \pcref{Rituals}).

        \cf*{Mge}[16]{Spell Point}
        You gain a spell point.
        A spell point can be spent to cast spells in place of an action point.
        You recover all spent spell points after a \glossterm{short rest}.

    \subsection{Arcane Lore}
        You must have the ability to cast arcane spells to gain these abilities.

        \cf*{Mge}[2]{Spell Knowledge} 
        You learn an additional spell from the arcane \glossterm{spell list} (see \pcref{Arcane Spells}).

        \cf{Mge}[3]{Arcane Insight} 
        You gain a greater understanding of magic.
        You choose one of the following insights.
        Each insight can be chosen multiple times.
        At 7th level, and every four levels thereafter, you gain an additional arcane insight.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Innate Spell: Choose a spell you know.
                You no longer need verbal or somatic components to cast that spell.
                \par If you choose this insight multiple times, you must choose a different spell each time.
            \item Personal Spell: Choose a spell you know.
                You cannot miscast that spell (see \pcref{Miscasting}).
                If you would miscast it, the spell simply fails without effect.
                In addition, you automatically succeeds at all Concentration checks you make to cast the spell.
                \par If you choose this insight multiple times, you must choose a different spell each time.
            \item Specialization: Choose a school of magic.
                You learn an additional spell from that school of magic.
                In exchange, you must ban two other schools of magic.
                You can never learn or cast spells or rituals from your banned schools.
                If you know spells from a banned school, you must immediately learn different spells from unbanned schools in their place.
                \par If you choose this insight multiple times, you must choose to specialize in the same school each time.
        \end{itemize}

        \subparhead{Sorcerer} You may also choose the Expanded Spell Knowledge insight.
        You choose a single spell from the divine spell list or nature spell list and add it to your arcane spell list.
        This does not grant you the spell as a spell known, but you may exchange one of your spells known to learn that new spell.
        \par If you choose this insight multiple times, you must choose a different spell each time.

        \subparhead{Wizard} You may also choose the Ritual Spell insight.
        You scribe an arcane spell you know into your ritual book.
        The spell is treated as a ritual, and you can perform a one minute ritual to cause the spell's effect.
        Other creatures may not participate in this ritual.
        You can apply \glossterm{augments} or \glossterm{subspells} to the spell normally, increasing the ritual's level appropriately.

        \cf{Mge}[5]{Lesser Essence Lore}[Magical]
        You gain an ability based on your choice of arcane essence.
        \subparhead{Sorcerer} You gain bonus hit points equal to your spellpower with arcane spells.
        \subparhead{Wizard} You gains a \plus2 bonus to all Knowledge skills.

        \cf*{Mge}[9]{Spell Knowledge}
        You learn an additional spell from the arcane \glossterm{spell list} (see \pcref{Arcane Spells}).

        \cf{Mge}[13]{Essence Lore}[Magical]
        You gain an ability based on your choice of arcane essence.
        \subparhead{Sorcerer} You gain \glossterm{magic resistance} equal to 5 \add your spellpower with arcane spells.
        \subparhead{Wizard} You learn the Contingency augment, allowing you to prepare a spell so it takes effect automatically if specific circumstances arise.
        The Contingency augment adds two levels to a spell's level.
        You can apply this augment to any arcane spell with a casting time of a single standard action.

        Casting a spell with the Contingency augment takes 5 minutes.
        When the casting is complete, the spell has no immediate effect.
        Instead, it automatically takes effect when some specific circumstances arise.
        During this casting time, you specify what circumstances cause the spell to take effect.

        The spell can be set to trigger in response to any circumstances that a typical human observing you and your situation could detect.
        For example, you could specify ``when I fall at least 50 feet'' or ``when I become bloodied'', but not ``when there is an invisible creature within 50 feet of me'' or ``when I am at 17 hit points or fewer.''
        The more specific the required circumstances, the better -- vague requirements, such as ``when I am in danger'', may cause the spell to trigger unexpectedly or fail to trigger at all.
        If you attempt to specify multiple separate triggering conditions, such as ``when I take damage or when an enemy is adjacent to me'', the spell will randomly ignore all but one of the conditions.

        If the spell needs to be targeted, the trigger condition can specify a simple rule for identifying how to target the spell, such as ``the closest enemy''.
        If the rule is poorly worded or imprecise, the spell may target incorrectly or fail to activate at all.
        Any spells which require decisions, such as the \spell{dimension door} spell, must have those decisions made at the time it is cast.
        You cannot alter those decisions when the contingency takes effect.

        You can have only one spell with this augment active at a time.
        If you use the augment again with a different spell, the new spell.

        \cf{Mge}[17]{Greater Essence Lore}[Magical]
        You gain an ability based on your choice of arcane essence.

        \subparhead{Sorcerer} Whenever you resist a spell with your \glossterm{magic resistance}, you gain the ability to cast that spell once.
        The spell retains all augments, effects from feats and other abilities, and similar modifications from the original caster, and you cannot choose any other augments or apply effects from your own abilities.
        However, you make all other decisions required to cast the spell, and uses your spellpower to determine the spell's effects.
        Once you cast the spell, you expend the absorbed energy, and you cannot cast it again.

        If you resist multiple spells simultaneously, or if you resist another spell with your magic resistance before casting the previous spell you resisted, you choose which spell you gain the ability to cast.

        \subparhead{Wizard} You may have two spells active with the Contingency augment, rather than only one.
        Whenever you cast a new spell with the Contingency augment, you choose which existing contingency to replace.

        Only one contingency can trigger in a given round.
        If both would trigger simultaneously, only the first spell cast triggers.
        The second spell cast does not trigger that round.

        \cf{Mge}[20]{Archmage}
        You no longer need to spend action points to cast spells.
        If you have any spell points, you lose those spell points and gain the same number of legend points instead.

    \subsection{Arcane Spell Mastery}
        You must have the ability to cast arcane spells to gain these abilities.

        \cf{Mge}[2]{Spell Point}
        You gain a spell point.
        A spell point can be spent to cast spells in place of an action point.
        You recover all spent spell points after a \glossterm{short rest}.

        \cf{Mge}[3]{Spell Knowledge} 
        You learn an additional spell from the arcane \glossterm{spell list} (see \pcref{Arcane Spells}).

        \cf{Mge}[4]{Subspells}
        Choose two \glossterm{subspells} for arcane spells you know.
        You can use those subspells when you cast those spells (see \pcref{Subspells}).
        At 6th level, and every two levels thereafter, you learn an additional subspell for an arcane spell you know.

    \classbasics{Alignment} Any nonchaotic.

    \classbasics{Archetypes} Monks have the Ki, Unfettered Warrior, and Transcendent Sage \glossterm{archetypes}.

    \subsection{Basic Class Abilities}
        If you are a monk, you gain the following abilities.

        \cf{Mnk}{Defenses}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item \subparhead{Strength} Climb, Jump, Sprint, Swim.
            \item \subparhead{Dexterity} Acrobatics, Escape Artist, Ride, Stealth.

        Monks are proficient with simple weapons, monk weapons, and any one other weapon group.
        Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields.
        When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses the benefit of your enlightened defense, fast movement, and \ki abilities.

    \subsection{Ki}
        All Ki archetype abilities are \glossterm{magical}.

        \cf{Mnk}{Ki Power}
        The \glossterm{power} of your ki abilities is determined by your \textit{ki power}.
        Your \textit{ki power} is equal to your level or your Willpower, whichever is higher.

        \cf{Mnk}{Ki Manifestation}
        You can channel your ki to temporarily enhance your abilities.
        Choose two \textit{ki manifestations} from the list below.
        You can spend an \glossterm{action point} to use a \textit{ki manifestation}, using the type of action indicated in the ability's description.
        You cannot use more than one \textit{ki manifestation} per round.

            \par At 6th level, this ability lasts until the end of the next round.
            \par At 12th level, you can also remove one condition affecting you when you use this ability.

            It lasts until the end of the round.
            If you are in free-fall, your fall is dramatically slowed.

            \par At 6th level, this ability's duration becomes Sustain (minor).
            \par At 12th level, you can control the speed of your fall, up to a maximum of 120 feet per round and a minimum of 30 feet per round.
            \par At 18th level, your maximum falling speed becomes 180 feet per round and your minimum falling speed becomes 10 feet per round.

            % TODO: is 'horizontally' the correct word?
            Whenever you move, you can teleport horizontally up to ten feet instead.
            This replaces the entire distance you would have moved that phase.
            If your \glossterm{line of effect} to your destination is blocked, or if this teleportaiton would somehow place you inside a solid object, your movement is cancelled and you remain where you are.
            \par At 6th level, the distance you can teleport is increased to half your movement speed.
            \par At 12th level, you can teleport in multiple steps within the same phase.
            Each step costs movement equal to twice the distance you teleport.
            \par At 18th level, you can attempt to teleport to locations outside of \glossterm{line of sight} and \glossterm{line of effect}.
            If your intended destination is invalid, the distance you spent teleporting is wasted, but you suffer no other ill effects.

            \subcf{Ki Strike}
            You can use this ability as a standard action.
            If you do, you make a \glossterm{strike}.
            You may use your \textit{ki power} in place of your Perception to determine your \glossterm{accuracy} with the strike, and in place of your Strength to determine your \glossterm{strike damage} with the strike.
            If the strike misses, you regain the action point spent to use this ability.
            \par At 6th level, your \glossterm{reach} is increased by 5 feet for the strike.
            \par At 12th level, the bonus to your reach increases to 10 feet. 
            \par At 18th level, this ability does not cost an action point to use.

            \par At 12th level, the Jump bonus increases to \plus15.

            \par At 6th level, you also take no penalty for climbing without using your hands.
            \par At 12th level, the Climb bonus increases to \plus10.
            \par At 18th level, you also take no penalty for climbing with only one limb, such as an arm or leg.

            It lasts until the end of the round.
            You gain the ability to see the ki of living creatures.
            You can ``see'' any living creatures and their equipment within 50 feet perfectly, regardless of lighting conditions, blindness, invisibility, or any other means of concealment.
            This cannot detect living creatures through solid walls, however.
            \par At 6th level, range is increased to 100 feet.
            \par At 12th level, duration becomes Sustain (minor).

            It lasts until the end of the round.
            You gain a \plus2 bonus to defenses against \glossterm{magical} abilities that directly target you.
            This does not protect you from abilities that affect an area.
            \par At 6th level, the defense bonus is increased to \plus4.
            \par At 12th level, the defense bonus is increased to \plus6.

            At the start of the round, you can use this ability.
            It lasts until the end of the round.
            You can use your \textit{ki power} in place of your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution when making checks.
            \par At 6th level, you also gain a \plus2 bonus to checks based on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution.
            \par At 12th level, the bonus increases to \plus4.

            It lasts until the end of the round.

        You are immune to hostile \glossterm{Mind} abilities.

        \cf{Mnk}[19]{Transcend Mortality}[Magical]
        If you die, you may choose to retain control of your body and soul through sheer force of will.
        Your body immediately disappears, and your soul does not travel to an afterlife.
        Instead, your body reforms with no trace of its injuries 8 hours later.

        You can reform your body at the place where you died, or in any place on the same plane that is deeply familiar to you.

        \cf{Pal}{Weapon and Armor Proficiencies}
        Paladins are proficient with simple weapons, any three other weapon groups, all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and shields.

        \cf{Pal}{Devoted Alignment} 
        You are devoted to a specific alignment.
        You must choose one of your alignment components: good, evil, lawful, or chaotic.
        The alignment you choose is your devoted alignment.
        Your paladin abilities are affected by this choice.
        % seems unnecessary
        % You excel at slaying creatures with alignments opposed to your devoted alignment.
        Your alignment cannot be changed without extraordinary repurcussions.

        \cf{Pal}{Devotion Power}
        The \glossterm{power} of many paladin spells and abilities is determined by your \textit{devotion power}.
        Your \textit{devotion power} is equal to your level or your Willpower, whichever is higher.

    \subsection{Devoted Paragon}

        \cf{Pal}[2]{Spell Point}
        You gain a spell point.
        A spell point can be spent to cast spells in place of an action point.
        You recover all spent spell points after a \glossterm{short rest}.

        \cf{Pal}[4]{Lay on Hands}[Magical] As a standard action, you can spend an \glossterm{action point} to use this ability.
        Your \glossterm{power} with this ability is equal to your \textit{devotion power}.
        \begin{ability}
            \begin{spelltargetinginfo}
                \spellquicktargeting{One willing creature}{Adjacent}
            \end{spelltargetinginfo}
            \begin{spelleffects}
                \spelleffect The target is healed for hit points equal to \glossterm{standard damage} \plus1d.
                In addition, you may remove one \glossterm{condition} from the target.
            \end{spelleffects}
        \end{ability}

        \cf{Pal}[5]{Aligned Aura}[Magical]
        Your devotion to your alignment affects the world around you, bringing it closer to your ideals.
        You constantly radiate an aura in an \areamed radius \glossterm{emanation} from you.
        The effect of the aura depends on your devoted alignment, as described below.
        You can suppress or resume the aura as a \glossterm{minor action}.

        \subparhead{Chaos} Whenever you or an ally in the area rolls a 1 on an attack roll when making a \glossterm{strike}, the attack roll explodes (see \pcref{Exploding Attacks}).
        This does not affect additional dice rolled if the attack roll explodes.
        \subparhead{Evil} All other creatures in the area suffer a \minus1 penalty to all defenses.
        \subparhead{Good} Whenever a creature in the area takes damage, you may take half that damage (rounded down) instead.
        Any abilities you have that would make the attack miss or fail have no effect, but your abilities that allow you to reduce or ignore its effects work normally.
        The protected creature takes the remaining half of the damage, and suffers any non-damaging effects of the attack normally.
        \subparhead{Law} Whenever you or an ally in the area rolls a 1 on an attack roll when making a \glossterm{strike}, the attack roll is treated as a 6.

        \cf{Pal}[8]{Unbending Devotion}[Magical]
        You are immune to \glossterm{Mind} \glossterm{conditions}.

        \cf{Pal}[9]{Expanded Aura}
        The area of your \textit{aligned aura} becomes a \arealarge radius \glossterm{emanation} from you.

        \cf{Pal}[12]{Greater Lay on Hands} 
        You gain a \plus1d bonus to the healing from your \textit{lay on hands} ability.
        In addition, you can remove any number of conditions with that ability, rather than only one.

        \cf{Pal}[13]{Greater Aligned Aura}[Magical]
        The effect of your \textit{aligned aura} becomes stronger based on your devoted alignment.

        \subparhead{Chaos} Whenever an enemy in the area rolls a 10 on an attack roll when making a \glossterm{strike}, it is forced to rereroll the attack roll and take the second result.
        \subparhead{Evil} The penalty imposed by the aura increases to \minus2.
        \subparhead{Good} When you redirect damage from an ally with this aura, you can redirect all effects of the attack to you instead of only half the damage.
        \subparhead{Law} Whenever an enemy in the area rolls a 10 on an attack roll when making a \glossterm{strike}, the attack roll is treated as a 6.

        \cf{Pal}[17]{Greater Unbending Devotion}
        You are immune to all hostile \glossterm{Mind} effects.

        \cf{Pal}[20]{Aligned Soul}[Magical]
        While you are dead, you may approach the deity or governing figure of your afterlife and request to be returned to life to continue your mission.
        Travelling to the relevant figure and making the request takes 12 hours.
        Unless there are extenuating circumstances, this request is almost always granted, and you are resurrected in a new body at a location of the entity's choice.
        This functions like the \ritual{resurrection} ritual, except that no part of the body is required, and a new body is created by the entity.
        You can be resurrected in this way regardless of the condition of your body, but not if your soul has been trapped or otherwise prevented from going to the correct afterlife.

        % TODO: clarify interaction between this ability and cleric spellcasting;
        % you shouldn't have both, but they technically use different spellpowers
    \subsection{Spellcasting}

        \cf{Pal}{Divine Spells}
        Your devotion to your alignment grants you the ability to cast divine spells.
        You learn two divine spells from the divine \glossterm{spell list} (see \pcref{Divine Spells}).
        Your \glossterm{spellpower} with divine spells is equal to your \textit{devotion power}.

        To cast a spell, you must normally spend an \glossterm{action point}.
        Every spell can also be cast as a cantrip.
        Cantrips are weaker, but do not require action points to cast.

        You can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to your own.
        Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the \glossterm{Chaos}, \glossterm{Good}, \glossterm{Evil}, and \glossterm{Law} tags in their spell descriptions.

        \cf{Pal}{Rituals}
        You can perform divine rituals to create unique magical effects (see \pcref{Rituals}).
        You have a ritual book containing one divine ritual of your choice (see \pcref{Divine Rituals}).

        \cf{Pal}[6]{Augment}
        Choose two \glossterm{augments} (see \pcref{Augments}).
        You can apply those augments to divine spells you cast and divine rituals you perform.
        At 10th level and 14th level, you learn an additional augment.

        \cf{Pal}[8]{Spell Knowledge}
        You learn an additional divine spell (see \pcref{Divine Spells}).

        \cf*{Pal}[16]{Spell Point} 
        You gain a spell point.
        A spell point can be spent to cast spells in place of an action point.
        You recover all spent spell points after a \glossterm{short rest}.

    \subsection{Zealous Warrior}
        \cf{Pal}{Smite}[Magical] As a standard action, you can spend an \glossterm{action point} to use this ability.
        \begin{ability}
            \begin{spelleffects}
                \spelleffect You make a \glossterm{strike}.
                If your target shares your devoted alignment, the strike deals no damage.
                Otherwise, the strike gains a \plus1d bonus to \glossterm{strike damage}, and you regain the action point spent to use this ability.
            \end{spelleffects}
        \end{ability}

        \cf{Pal}[3]{Zealous Offense}[Magical]
        If you deal damage to a creature with your \textit{smite} ability, you gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with \glossterm{physical attacks} against that creature.
        This effect lasts until you take a \glossterm{short rest}.

        \cf{Pal}[7]{Unfaltering Zeal}
        You gain a \plus1 bonus to Fortitude, Reflex, and Mental defense.

        \cf{Pal}[11]{Pass Judgment}[Magical] As a \glossterm{minor action}, you can spend an \glossterm{action point} to use this ability.
        \begin{ability}
            \begin{spelltargetinginfo}
                \spellquicktargeting{One creature}{\rngmed}
            \end{spelltargetinginfo}
            \begin{spelleffects}
                \spelleffect For the purpose of all spells and effects, the target is treated as if it had the alignment opposed to your devoted alignment.
                This only affects its alignment along the alignment axis your devoted alignment is on.
                For example, if your devoted alignment was evil, a chaotic neutral target would be treated as chaotic good.
                In addition, the target is treated as if you had smited it for the purpose of the \textit{zealous offense} ability and similar effects.

                You can use this ability to do battle against foes who share your alignment, but you should exercise caution in doing so.
                Persecution of allies can lead you to fall and become an ex-paladin.
                \spelldur{Attunement}
            \end{spelleffects}
        \end{ability}

        \cf{Pal}[15]{Greater Zealous Offense}[Magical]
        The accuracy bonus from your \textit{zealous offense} ability increases to \plus2.

        \cf{Pal}[19]{Greater Unfaltering Zeal}
        The bonus to defenses from your \textit{unfaltering zeal} ability increases to \plus2.

        % TODO: Doesn't work with new spell system
        % \cf{Pal}[20]{Martyr's Retribution}[Mag]
        % If you die in the service of your devoted alignment, you may choose to have your fallen body erupt in an immense burst of divine energy.
        % If you do, your body is almost completely consumed, preventing you from being raised with \ritual{resurrection} and similar effects that require an intact body.
        % This burst has two effects.
        % First, a \spell{sunburst} spell immediately takes effect over the area where you died.
        % Second, a \spell{storm of vengeance} spell begins to take effect, centered on the same area.
        % The spell lasts for 10 rounds, and the lightning strikes target the paladin's enemies.
        % Both of these effects harm only the paladin's foes, and do not harm your allies.
        % However, your allies' vision is still impeded by the \spell{storm of vengeance}.

    \subsection{Ex-Paladins}
        If you cease to follow your devoted alignment, you lose all \glossterm{magical} paladin class abilities.
        If your atone for your misdeeds and resume the service of your devoted alignment, you can regain your abilities.
