\chapter{Classes}\label{Classes}

Your character's class represents the things your character has chosen to train in.
This choice determines a great deal about your character's abilities.

\section{How Classes Work}
    When you first create a character, you choose a class.
    You gain all abilities granted by the \glossterm{archetypes} of your chosen class at the levels indicated in the archetype's description (see Archetypes, below).
    As you gain levels, you gain more abilities from your class.

    \subsection{Archetypes}\label{Archetypes}
        Each class has three or four \glossterm{archetypes}.
        An archetype is a collection of thematically related class abilities.
        For examples, barbarians have the Battlerager archetype, which grants abilities related to flying into a rage in combat.

        Normally, you choose three of the archetypes associated with your class at 1st level.
        You gain the abilities from those three archetypes, and you gain no abilities from any additional archetypes the class has.

        \subsubsection{Archetype Ranks}\label{Archetype Ranks}
            You have an \glossterm{archetype rank} associated with each archetype you have.
            Each ability from an archetype has a minimum rank required to gain the ability.

            At 1st level, you are Rank 1 in each archetype.
            This gives you the Rank 1 abilities from each of your archetypes.
            Every level thereafter, you increase your rank in one archetype of your choice.
            This gives you the abilities associated with that rank.

            Each \glossterm{archetype rank} has a minimum level, as shown on \trefnp{Archetype Ranks by Level}.

            \begin{dtable}
                \lcaption{Archetype Ranks by Level}
                \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{l >{\lcol}X}
                    \tb{Archetype Rank} & \tb{Minimum Level} \tableheaderrule
                    1     & 1
                    \\ 2  & 2
                    \\ 3  & 5
                    \\ 4  & 8
                    \\ 5 & 11
                    \\ 6 & 14
                    \\ 7 & 17
                    \\ 8 & 20
                \end{dtabularx}
            \end{dtable}

        \subsubsection{Duplicate Archetypes}\label{Duplicate Archetypes}
            Some archetypes can be gained by multiple classes.
            For example, both clerics and paladins have the Divine Spellcasting archetype.
            You cannot gain two archetypes with the same name, even if you can choose archetypes from multiple classes.

        \subsection{Multiclass Characters}\label{Multiclass Characters}
            You can spend two \glossterm{insight points} to become a \glossterm{multiclass} character (see \pcref{Insight Points}).
            If you do, choose a class other than your base class.
            You gain the following benefits relating to that class.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item You gain the \glossterm{class skills} of that class in addition to your existing \glossterm{class skills}.
                \item You can exchange any number of your basic class abilities, such as weapon proficiencies, for the corresponding abilities of that class.
                \item If that class has any class abilities which are not part of an archetype, such as a cleric's \textit{divine power}, you gain those abilities.
                \item You may gain one \glossterm{archetype} from your that class in place of one \glossterm{archetype} from your base class.
            \end{itemize}

            You may gain access to multiple classes in this way, spending two \glossterm{insight points} for each class.

\section{Class Introductions}

    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Class Description Format}
        Each class is described from the perspective of a member of that class, using ``you'' in the description.

        \parhead{Class Table}
        The class's table describes the special abilities a member of that class gains at each level, assuming they have all of that class's \glossterm{archetypes}.

        \parhead{Alignment}
        Some classes require specific alignments (see \pcref{Alignment}).
        Most classes allow characters of any alignment.

        \parhead{Skills}
        Each class has specific \glossterm{skills} that members of that class are typically good at (see \pcref{Skills}).
        These skills are called \glossterm{class skills}.
        It is easier to become \glossterm{mastered} in class skills than in other skills.
        For details, see \pcref{Skill Training}.

        \parhead{Defenses}
        Each class grants bonuses to specific defenses.

        \parhead{Weapon and Armor Proficiencies}
        These are the types of equipment that members of this class are trained in using.

        \parhead{Other Special Abilities}
        Some classes have abilities shared by all members of the class that are not part of an archetype, such as a druid's \textit{druidic language} ability.

        \parhead{Archetypes}
        The abilities associated with each of the three archetypes the class has.

                You and your \glossterm{allies} within a \arealarge radius learn the results of your check.
                Creatures believe the information gained in this way to be true as if they it had seen it with their own eyes.

                You cannot alter the knowledge you gain with this check in any way, such as by adding or withholding information.
            \end{freeability}
            \parhead{Mastery} You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with all attacks.

            % Clarify - does this apply to exploding dice?
            \parhead{Aspect} When you roll a 1 on an \glossterm{attack roll}, it is treated as if you had rolled a 6.
            \parhead{Essence} You can use the \textit{compel law} ability as a standard action.
            \begin{freeability}{Compel Law}[\glossterm{Compulsion}]
                Make an attack vs. Mental against all creatures within a \arealarge radius.
                \hit Each target is unable to break the laws that apply in the area, and any attempt to do so simply fails.
                The laws which are applied are those which are most appropriate for the area, regardless of whether you or any other creature know those laws.

                % Sufficiently clear that this isn't part of the hit effect?
                When you use this ability, you also gain the condition.
                If this condition is removed from you, it is also removed from all other affected creatures.
                In areas under ambiguous or nonexistent government, this ability may have unexpected effects, or it may have no effect at all.
            \end{freeability}
            \parhead{Mastery} When you roll less than a 5 on an \glossterm{attack roll}, it is treated as if you had rolled a 5.

            \parhead{Mastery} The bonus to \glossterm{wound rolls} from this domain's aspect increases to \plus3.

        \subsubsection{Magic}
            \parhead{Gift} You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{power} with \glossterm{magical} abilities.

            \parhead{Essence} You learn an \glossterm{augment} (see \pcref{Augments}).
            You can apply augments to spells to change their effects.

            \end{attuneability}
            \parhead{Mastery} You gain a \plus1 bonus to your starting Strength.

        \subsubsection{Travel}
            If you choose this domain, you add the \sphere{astromancy} \glossterm{mystic sphere} to your list of divine mystic spheres (see \pcref{Mystic Spheres}).

            \begin{freeability}{Dimensional Travel}[\glossterm{Teleportation}]
                You teleport up to 1 mile in any direction.
                You do not need \glossterm{line of sight} or \glossterm{line of effect} to your destination, but you must be able to clearly visualize it.
            \end{freeability}
            \parhead{Mastery} When you move, you can teleport the same distance instead.
            This does not change the total distance you can move, but you can teleport in any direction, including vertically.

            You can even attempt to move to locations outside of \glossterm{line of sight} and \glossterm{line of effect}, up to the limit of your remaining movement speed.
            If your intended destination is invalid, the distance you tried to teleport is taken from your remaining movement, but you suffer no other ill effects.

        \subsubsection{Trickery}
            If you choose this domain, you add the \sphere{glamer} \glossterm{mystic sphere} to your list of divine mystic spheres (see \pcref{Mystic Spheres}).

                You must also choose a belief that the target has.
                The belief may be a lie that you told it, or even a simple misunderstanding (such as believing a hidden creature is not present in a room).
                If the creature does not already hold the chosen belief, this ability automatically fails.
                \hit The target continues to maintain the chosen belief, regardless of any evidence to the contrary.
                It will interpret any evidence that the falsehood is incorrect to be somehow wrong -- an illusion, a conspiracy to decieve it, or any other reason it can think of to continue believing the falsehood.
                At the end of the effect, the creature can decide whether it believes the falsehood or not, as normal.
            \end{freeability}
            \parhead{Mastery} You are undetectable by Divination spells and effects.
            They cannot detect your presence, sounds you make, or any actions you take.

            \parhead{Essence} You learn one of the Legion, Selective, or Widened \glossterm{augments} (see \pcref{Augments}).
            You can apply augments to spells to change their effects.
            When you gain access to a new arcane spell \glossterm{rank}, you may change which augments you know, though this augment can only be one of the three listed.
            \parhead{Mastery} You gain a \plus2 bonus to \glossterm{power} with \glossterm{mundane} abilities.

        \subsubsection{Water}
            If you choose this domain, you add the \sphere{aquamancy} \glossterm{mystic sphere} to your list of divine mystic spheres (see \pcref{Mystic Spheres}).

            \begin{attuneability}{Speak with Water}[\glossterm{Attune} (self)]
                You can speak with and command water within a \areahuge zone from your location.
                You can ask the water simple questions and understand its responses.
                If you command the water to perform a task, it will do so do the best of its ability until this effect ends.
                You cannot compel the water to move faster than 30 feet per round.

                After you use this ability on a particular area of water, you cannot use it again on that same area for 24 hours.
            \end{attuneability}
            \parhead{Mastery}
            When you move, you can transform yourself into a rushing flow of water with a volume roughly equal to your normal volume until your movement is complete.
            In this form, you may move wherever water could go, you cannot take other actions, such as jumping, attacking, or casting spells.
            You may move through squares occupied by enemies without penalty.
            \par Your speed is halved when moving uphill and doubled when moving downhill.
            Unusually steep inclines may cause greater movement differences while in this form.
            \par If the water is split, you may reform from anywhere the water has reached, to as little as a single ounce of water.
            If not even an ounce of water exists contiguously, your body reforms from all of the largest available sections of water, cut into pieces of appropriate size.
            This usually causes you to die.

        \subsubsection{Wild}
            If you choose this domain, you add the \sphere{verdamancy} \glossterm{mystic sphere} to your list of divine mystic spheres (see \pcref{Mystic Spheres}).
            In addition, you add the Creature Handling, Knowledge (nature), and Survival skills to your cleric \glossterm{class skill} list.

            \parhead{Gift} You gain two skill points.
            % TODO: clarify whether you can have this and the druid ability
            \parhead{Aspect} This ability functions like the \textit{wild aspect} druid ability from the Shifter archetype (see \pcref{Shifter}), except that you cannot spend \glossterm{insight points} to learn additional wild aspects.
            \parhead{Essence} You learn an additional \textit{wild aspect}.
            In addition, you gain the ability to maintain two \textit{wild aspects} simultaneously.
            \parhead{Mastery} You learn an additional \textit{wild aspect}.
            In addition, you gain the ability to maintain three \textit{wild aspects} simultaneously.
            % TODO: essence, mastery

        \subsubsection{Ex-Clerics}
            If you grossly violate the code of conduct required by your deity, you lose all spells and magical cleric class abilities.
            You cannot regain those abilities until you atone for your transgressions to your deity.

    \classbasics{Alignment} Neutral good, lawful neutral, neutral, chaotic neutral, or neutral evil.

    \classbasics{Archetypes} Druids have the Beastmaster, Nature Spellcasting, Nature Spell Mastery, and Shifter \glossterm{archetypes}.

    \subsection{Basic Class Abilities}
        If you are a druid, you gain the following abilities.

        \cf{Drd}{Defenses}
        You gain the following bonuses to your \glossterm{defenses}: \plus5 Fortitude, \plus3 Reflex, \plus4 Mental.

        \cf{Drd}{Skills}
        You have the following \glossterm{class skills}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \subparhead{Strength} Climb, Jump, Swim.
            \item \subparhead{Dexterity} Acrobatics, Ride, Stealth.
            \item \subparhead{Intelligence} Craft, Deduction, Heal, Knowledge (geography, nature).
            \item \subparhead{Perception} Awareness, Creature Handling, Survival.
            \item \subparhead{Other} Bluff, Intimidate, Persuasion, Profession.
        \end{itemize}

        \cf{Drd}{Weapon and Armor Proficiencies}
        Druids are proficient with simple weapons, any one other weapon group, scimitars, sickles, and slings.
        In addition, druids are proficient with light armor, medium armor, and shields.
        However, a druid cannot use metal armor; see the Metal Abhorrence ability, below.

        \cf{Drd}{Druidic Language}
        You know Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, in addition to your normal languages.
        Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.
        Druidic has its own alphabet.

        \cf{Drd}{Metal Abhorrence}
        The oaths that you swear as part of your druidic initiation prohibit you from wearing armor made of metal.
        If you wear prohibited armor or carry a prohibited shield, you are unable to cast druid spells or use any of your \glossterm{magical} druid abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.

        You can avoid this penalty by using armor made of wood altered with the \ritual{ironwood} ritual.
        Such wood is as strong as steel.

    \subsection{Beastmaster}
        This archetype improves your connection to animals, allowing you to control and command them in battle.

        \cf{Drd}[1]{Animal Companion}
        You can use the \textit{animal companion} ability.
        This ability requires 8 hours of training and attunement which the target must actively parcipate in.
        You can compel a wild animal to undergo this training by sustaining the \textit{command} ability from the Creature Handling skill (see \pcref{Command}).
        \begin{attuneability}{Animal Companion}[\glossterm{Attune} (self), \glossterm{Emotion}, \glossterm{Magical}]
            Choose an animal \glossterm{ally} within your \glossterm{reach} with a level no higher than your level and a \glossterm{challenge rating} no higher than 1.
            The target serves as a loyal companion to you.
            It follows your directions to the best of its ability.
            Animals are unable to understand complex concepts, so their ability to obey convoluted instructions is limited.

            Your magical connection to the animal improves its resilience and strength in combat.
            If any of its statistics are higher than the normal values below, the animal uses its own statistics instead.
            All other aspects of the animal, such as its speed and natural weapons, are unchanged.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Its \glossterm{damage resistance} and \glossterm{wound resistance} are equal to the base values for your level (see \pcref{Character Advancement}).
                \item Its \glossterm{hit points} are equal to 6.
                \item Each of its \glossterm{defenses} is normally equal to 4 \add your level.
                \item Its \glossterm{accuracy} is normally equal to the higher of your level and Perception.
                \item Its \glossterm{power} with its attacks is normally equal to your \glossterm{power}.
                \item It can heal \glossterm{vital damage} using your level in place of its level.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{attuneability}

        \cf{Drd}[2]{Wild Speech}[Magical] You can use the \textit{wild speech} ability as a standard action.
        \begin{attuneability}{Wild Speech}[\glossterm{Attune} (self)]
            Choose an animal within \rnglong range.
            You can speak to and understand the speech of the target animal, and any other animals of the same species.

            This ability does not make the target any more friendly or cooperative than normal.
            Wary and cunning animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while stupid ones tend to make inane comments and are unlikely to say or understand anything of use.
        \end{attuneability}

        \cf{Drd}[3]{Beast Tamer} You gain a \plus4 bonus to the Creature Handling skill (see \pcref{Creature Handling}).

        \cf{Drd}[4]{Beast Companion} When you use your \textit{animal companion} ability,
        you can target a \glossterm{magical beast} \glossterm{ally} with an Intelligence of \minus6 or lower instead of an animal.

        \cf{Drd}[5]{Greater Wild Speech} When you use your \textit{wild speech} ability, you do not have to target an animal.
        Instead, you understand the speech of animals of any species.

        \cf{Drd}[6]{Greater Beast Tamer} The bonus from your \textit{beast tamer} ability increaeses to \plus8.

        \cf{Drd}[7]{True Companion} The maximum \glossterm{challenge rating} of creatures you can affect with your \textit{animal companion} increases to 2.
        In addition, the creature affected by your \textit{animal companion} ability has its \glossterm{challenge rating} increased to 2 if it was lower.

    \subsection{Nature Spellcasting}
        This archetype grants you the ability to cast nature spells.
        You must have a starting Perception of at least 1 to gain this archetype.

        \cf{Drd}[1]{Spellcasting}[Magical]
        Your connection to nature grants you the ability to use nature magic.
        You gain access to one nature \glossterm{mystic sphere} (see \pcref{Nature Mystic Spheres}).
        You may spend \glossterm{insight points} to learn one additional \glossterm{mystic sphere} per two \glossterm{insight points}.
        Each \glossterm{mystic sphere} has a set of \glossterm{spells} associated with it.

        You automatically learn all \glossterm{cantrips} from any mystic sphere you have access to.
        In addition, you learn one rank 1 \glossterm{spell} from your chosen \glossterm{mystic sphere}.
        You can also spend \glossterm{insight points} to learn one additional nature spell per \glossterm{insight point}.
        Unless otherwise noted in a spell's description, casting a spell requires a \glossterm{standard action}.

        When you gain access to a new \glossterm{mystic sphere} or spell \glossterm{rank},
            you can exchange any number of spells you know for other spells,
            including spells of the higher rank.

        Nature spells require \glossterm{verbal components} to cast (see \pcref{Casting Components}).
        For details about mystic spheres and casting spells, see \pcref{Spell and Ritual Mechanics}.

        \cf{Drd}[2]{Mystic Sphere} You gain access to an additional nature \glossterm{mystic sphere}, including all \glossterm{cantrips} from that sphere.
        In addition, you learn an additional nature \glossterm{spell}.

        \cf{Drd}[3]{Spell Rank}[Magical] You gain the ability to cast rank 3 nature spells.

        \cf*{Drd}[4]{Spell Rank}[Magical] You gain the ability to cast rank 4 nature spells.

        \cf*{Drd}[5]{Spell Rank}[Magical] You gain the ability to cast rank 5 nature spells.

        \cf*{Drd}[6]{Spell Rank}[Magical] You gain the ability to cast rank 6 nature spells.

        \cf*{Drd}[7]{Spell Rank}[Magical] You gain the ability to cast rank 7 nature spells.

        \cf*{Drd}[8]{Spell Rank}[Magical] You gain the ability to cast rank 8 nature spells.

    \subsection{Nature Spell Mastery}
        This archetype improves the nature spells you cast.
        You must be able to cast nature spells to gain the abilities from this archetype.

        \cf{Drd}[1]{Mystic Knowledge}
        You gain your choice of one of the following abilities.
        {
            \parhead{Focused Caster} You reduce your \glossterm{focus penalty} by 1.
                You can choose this ability multiple times.
                Its effects stack.
            \parhead{Insight} You learn an additional nature \glossterm{spell} (see \pcref{Nature Mystic Spheres}).
                You can choose this ability multiple times, gaining access to an additional spell each time.
            \parhead{Mystic Sphere Access} You gain access to an additional nature \glossterm{mystic sphere}.
                You cannot choose this ability multiple times.
            \parhead{Rituals} You gain the ability to perform nature rituals to create unique magical effects (see \pcref{Rituals}).
                The maximum \glossterm{rank} of nature ritual you can learn or perform is equal to the maximum rank of divine spell that you can cast.
                You cannot choose this ability multiple times.
        }

        \cf{Drd}[2]{Natural Spells} Your spells ignore \glossterm{cover} and \glossterm{concealment} provided by living plants (but not \glossterm{total cover}).

        \cf{Drd}[3]{Wellspring of Power}[Magical]

    \subsection{Shifter}\label{Shifter}
        This archetype grants you the ability to embody aspects of the natural world in your own form.

        \cf{Drd}[1]{Wild Aspects}[Magical]
        You gain the ability to embody an aspect of an animal or of nature itself.
        Choose a single wild aspect from the list below.
        You can also spend \glossterm{insight points} to learn one additional \textit{wild aspect} per \glossterm{insight point}.

        As a \glossterm{standard action}, you can gain the effects of one wild aspect that you know.
        That effect lasts until you activate a different wild aspect you know.

        The abilities in the list below describe the effects of the aspect.
        Your appearance also changes to match the aspect's effects, but the nature of this change is not described.
        Different druids change in different ways.
        For example, one druid might grow brown fur when using the Form of the Bear, while another might instead change their face to become broader and more bear-shaped when embodying the same aspect.
        You choose how your appearance changes when you gain a wild aspect.
        This change cannot be used to gain an additional substantive benefit beyond the effects given in the description of the aspect.

        Many wild aspects grant natural weapons.
        See \pcref{Natural Weapons}, for details about natural weapons.

        At the end of that time, you are reincarnated in a new body in your location, as the effect of the \ritual{reincarnation} ritual, except that you can choose your species from among the species listed (not including the ``Other'' species).

        When you gain access to a new \glossterm{mystic sphere} or spell \glossterm{rank},
            you can exchange any number of spells you know for other spells,
            including spells of the higher rank.

        Arcane spells require both \glossterm{verbal components} and \glossterm{somatic components} to cast (see \pcref{Casting Components}).
        For details about mystic spheres and casting spells, see \pcref{Spell and Ritual Mechanics}.

        \cf{Mge}[1]{Mystic Knowledge}[Magical]
        You gain your choice of one of the following abilities.
        {
            \parhead{Focused Caster} You reduce your \glossterm{focus penalty} by 1.
                You can choose this ability multiple times.
                Its effects stack.

                You cannot choose this ability multiple times.

                The maximum \glossterm{rank} of arcane ritual you can learn or perform is equal to the maximum rank of arcane spell that you can cast.
                You gain the ability to perform arcane rituals to create unique magical effects (see \pcref{Rituals}).
                You cannot choose this ability multiple times.

                You can choose this ability multiple times, gaining access to an additional spell each time.
        }

        \cf{Mge}[2]{Mage Armor}[Magical] You can use the \textit{mage armor} ability as a standard action.
        \begin{freeability}{Mage Armor}
            You create a translucent suit of magical armor on your body and over your hands.
            This functions like body armor that provides a \plus2 bonus to Armor defense and has no \glossterm{encumbrance}.
            It also provides a bonus to \glossterm{resistances} against \glossterm{energy damage} equal to half your level.
            The body armor does not appear if you are wearing other body armor of any kind.

            As long as you have a free hand, the barrier also manifests as a shield that provides a \plus1 bonus to Armor defense.
            This bonus is considered to come from a shield, and does not stack with the benefits of using a physical shield.

            This ability lasts until you \glossterm{dismiss} it as a free action.
        \end{freeability}

        \cf{Mge}[3]{Wellspring of Power}[Magical]
        You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{power} with arcane spells.

        \cf*{Mge}[7]{Mystic Knowledge}[Magical]
        You gain an additional \textit{mystic knowledge} ability.

    \subsection{Arcane Scholar}
        This archetype deepens your study of arcane magic.
        You be a wizard and have the Arcane Spellcasting archetype to gain the abilities from this archetype.

        \cf{Mge}[1]{Scholastic Lore} You gain a \plus2 bonus to the Spellcraft skill and all Knowledge skills.

        \cf{Mge}[2]{Rituals} You gain the ability to perform arcane rituals to create unique magical effects (see \pcref{Rituals}).
        The maximum \glossterm{rank} of arcane ritual you can learn or perform is equal to the maximum rank of arcane spell that you can cast.

        \cf{Mge}[3]{Arcane Insight}[Magical]
        You gain one of the following insights.
        Some insights can be chosen multiple times, as indicated in their descriptions.

        {
            \parhead{Expanded Sphere Access} You gain access to a new \glossterm{mystic sphere}.
            \par You cannot choose this insight multiple times.

            \parhead{Expanded Spell Knowledge} You learn an additional \glossterm{spell}.
            \par You can choose this insight multiple times, learning an additional spell each time.

            \parhead{Signature Spell} Choose a \glossterm{spell} you know.
            The spell loses the \glossterm{Focus} tag, allowing you to cast it without lowering your guard in combat.
            \par If you choose this insight multiple times, you must choose a different \glossterm{spell} each time.

            \parhead{Sphere Specialization} Choose a a \glossterm{mystic sphere} you have access to.
            You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with abilities from that \glossterm{mystic sphere}.
            In addition, you learn an additional \glossterm{spell} from that \glossterm{mystic sphere}.
            In exchange, you must lose access to another \glossterm{mystic sphere} you have.
            You must exchange all spells you know from that \glossterm{mystic sphere} with spells from other \glossterm{mystic spheres} you have access to.
            \par You cannot choose this insight multiple times.

            \parhead{Memorized Sphere} % TODO: clarify you need to be high enough rank?
            Choose a \glossterm{mystic sphere} you have access to.
            You can perform rituals from that \glossterm{mystic sphere} without having them written in your ritual book.
            If you lead a ritual from that \glossterm{mystic sphere}, it requires half the normal amount of time to perform and costs half the normal number of \glossterm{action points} (minimum 1).
            \par You can choose this insight multiple times, choosing a different \glossterm{mystic sphere} each time.
        }

        \cf{Mge}[4]{Greater Scholastic Lore} The bonuses from your \textit{scholastic lore} ability increase to \plus4.

        \cf{Mge}[5]{Contingency}  You learn the Contingency \glossterm{augment}, allowing you to prepare a spell so it takes effect automatically if specific circumstances arise.
        Applying the Contingency \glossterm{augment} increases the \glossterm{rank} of the spell and all its upgrades by 2.
        % If any spells take more than one standard action, they would need to be excluded from Contingency, but none exist
        % You can apply this augment to any arcane spell that can be cast as a \glossterm{standard action} or \glossterm{minor action}.

        Casting a spell with the Contingency augment takes 5 minutes.
        When the casting is complete, the spell has no immediate effect.
        Instead, it automatically takes effect when some specific circumstances arise.
        During the time required to cast the spell, you specify what circumstances cause the spell to take effect.

        The spell can be set to trigger in response to any circumstances that a typical human observing you and your situation could detect.
        For example, you could specify ``when I fall at least 50 feet'' or ``when I take a \glossterm{vital wound}'', but not ``when there is an invisible creature within 50 feet of me'' or ``when I have only one \glossterm{hit point} remaining.''
        The more specific the required circumstances, the better -- vague requirements, such as ``when I am in danger'', may cause the spell to trigger unexpectedly or fail to trigger at all.
        If you attempt to specify multiple separate triggering conditions, such as ``when I take damage or when an enemy is adjacent to me'', the spell will randomly ignore all but one of the conditions.

        If the spell needs to be targeted, the trigger condition can specify a simple rule for identifying how to target the spell, such as ``the closest enemy''.
        If the rule is poorly worded or imprecise, the spell may target incorrectly or fail to activate at all.
        Any spells which require decisions, such as the \spell{dimension door} spell, must have those decisions made at the time it is cast.
        You cannot alter those decisions when the contingency takes effect.

        You can have only one spell with this augment active at a time.
        If you use the augment again with a different spell, the old contingency is removed.

        \cf*{Mge}[6]{Arcane Insight}[Magical]
        You learn an additional \textit{arcane insight}.

        \cf{Mge}[7]{Malleable Contingency} If you have a \textit{contingency} active, you can change the conditions to trigger your \textit{contingency} as a standard action.
        This does not allow you to change the spell stored in your \textit{contingency}.

    \subsection{Innate Arcanist}
        This archetype deepens your innate connection to arcane magic.
        You be a sorcerer and have the Arcane Spellcasting archetype to gain the abilities from this archetype.

        \cf{Mge}[1]{Nonverbal Caster} When you cast a spell, you can omit that spell's \glossterm{verbal components}.

        \cf{Mge}[2]{Innate Magic} You gain a bonus to \glossterm{resistances} against \glossterm{energy damage} equal to half your level.

        \cf{Mge}[3]{Augment} You learn one \glossterm{augment} (see \pcref{Augments}).
        You can apply augments to spells to change their effects.
        When you gain access to a new arcane spell \glossterm{rank}, you may change which augments you know.

        \cf{Mge}[4]{Stilled Caster} When you cast a spell, you can omit that spell's \glossterm{somatic components}.

        \cf{Mge}[5]{Greater Innate Magic} The bonus from your \textit{innate magic} ability increases to be equal to your level.

        \cf*{Mge}[6]{Augment} You learn an additional \glossterm{augment}.

        \cf{Mge}[7]{Spell Absorption} When a spell is used to attack you, if the attack fails to beat your defenses, you gain the ability to cast the spell once.
        The spell retains its original \glossterm{augments}, if any, and you cannot apply any \glossterm{augments} to it.
        When you cast the spell, you use your own \glossterm{accuracy}, \glossterm{power}, and abilities to determine the effects of the spell.
        Once you cast the spell, you expend the absorbed energy, and you cannot cast it again.

        If you resist multiple spells simultaneously, or if you resist another spell before casting the previous spell you resisted, you choose which spell you gain the ability to cast.

        \cf{Mnk}[1]{Esoteric Maneuvers} 
        You learn one \glossterm{maneuver} from the esoteric maneuver list (see \pcref{Esoteric Maneuvers}).
        You can also spend \glossterm{insight points} to learn one additional \glossterm{maneuver} per \glossterm{insight point}.

        In addition, you gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with grapple actions (see \pcref{Grapple Actions}).

        % TODO: wording?
        % \cf{Mnk}[3]{Evasion} When you are attacked by an ability that affects an area, you can use your Reflex defense in place of any other defenses against that attack.

        If you are not wearing armor and have no \glossterm{encumbrance}, you gain a ki barrier around your body.
        This functions like body armor that provides a \plus2 bonus to Armor defense and a \plus2 bonus to \glossterm{resistances} against \glossterm{energy damage}.
        The armor has no \glossterm{encumbrance}.

        As long as you have a free hand, the barrier also manifests as a shield that provides a \plus1 bonus to Armor defense.
        This bonus is considered to come from a shield, and does not stack with the benefits of using a physical shield.

        \cf{Mnk}[1]{Ki Manifestations}[Magical]
        You can channel your ki to temporarily enhance your abilities.
        Choose one \textit{ki manifestation} from the list below.

        You can use any \textit{ki manifestation} ability you know using the type of action indicated in the ability's description.

        After you use a \textit{ki manifestation}, you cannot use a \textit{ki manifestation} until after the end of the next round.
        {
            \begin{freeability}{Abandon the Fragile Self}[\glossterm{Swift}]
                You can use this ability as a \glossterm{free action}.
                You can negate one \glossterm{condition} that would be applied to you this phase.
                In exchange, you take a \minus2 penalty to \glossterm{defenses} this phase.

                \rankline
                \rank{3} You can negate any number of conditions instead of only one condition.
                \rank{5} The effect lasts until the end of the round.
                \rank{7} The defense penalty is reduced to \minus1.
            \end{freeability}

            \begin{freeability}{Burst of Blinding Speed}[\glossterm{Swift}]
                You can use this ability as a \glossterm{free action}.
                You gain a \plus10 foot bonus to your land speed this phase.

            \begin{freeability}{Elegant Whirl of Fluid Motion}[\glossterm{Swift}]

                \rank{3} The bonus increases to \plus10.
                \rank{5} The bonus lasts until the end of the next round.
                \rank{7} The bonus increases to \plus20.
            \end{freeability}

            \begin{freeability}{Extend the Flow of Ki}[\glossterm{Swift}]
                You can use this ability as a \glossterm{free action}.
                You gain a \plus5 foot \glossterm{magic bonus} to \glossterm{reach} this phase.

                \rankline
                \rank{3} 
                \rank{5} The bonus to \glossterm{reach} increases to 10 feet.
                \rank{7} 
            \end{freeability}

            \begin{freeability}{Flash Step}[\glossterm{Teleportation}]
                You can use this ability as part of movement.
                % TODO: is 'horizontally' the correct word?
                You teleport horizontally instead of moving normally.
                If your \glossterm{line of effect} to your destination is blocked, or if this teleportation would somehow place you inside a solid object, your teleportation is cancelled and you remain where you are.

                Teleporting a given distance costs movement equal to twice that distance.
                For example, if you have a 30 foot movement speed, you can move 10 feet, teleport 5 feet, and move an additional 10 feet before your movement ends.

                \rankline
                \rank{3} You can use this ability to move even if you are \glossterm{immobilized} or \glossterm{grappled}.
                \rank{5} The movement cost to teleport is reduced to be equal to the distance you teleport.
                \rank{7} You can attempt to teleport to locations outside of \glossterm{line of sight} and \glossterm{line of effect}.
                If your intended destination is invalid, the distance you spent teleporting is wasted, but you suffer no other ill effects.

            \begin{freeability}{Leap of the Heavens}[\glossterm{Swift}]
                You can use this ability as a \glossterm{free action}.

    \classbasics{Alignment} Any other than true neutral.

    \classbasics{Archetypes} Paladins have the Devoted Paragon, Divine Spellcasting, Zealous Warrior, and Stalwart Guardian \glossterm{archetypes}.
    If you are a paladin, you choose three of those four archetypes.

    \subsection{Basic Class Abilities}
        If you are a paladin, you gain the following abilities.

        \cf{Pal}{Defenses}

        \cf{Pal}{Devoted Alignment} 
        You are devoted to a specific alignment.
        You must choose one of your alignment components: good, evil, lawful, or chaotic.
        The alignment you choose is your devoted alignment.
        Your paladin abilities are affected by this choice.
        % seems unnecessary
        % You excel at slaying creatures with alignments opposed to your devoted alignment.
        Your alignment cannot be changed without extraordinary repurcussions.

    \subsection{Devoted Paragon}
        This archetype deepens your connection to your alignment, granting you an aura and improving your combat abilities.

        \cf{Pal}[1]{Aligned Aura}[Magical]
        Your devotion to your alignment affects the world around you, bringing it closer to your ideals.
        You constantly radiate an aura in a \areamed radius \glossterm{emanation} from you.
        You can freely choose whether yourself and your \glossterm{allies}, \glossterm{enemies}, and other creatures are affected by the aura.
        The effect of the aura depends on your devoted alignment, as described below.
        You can suppress or resume the aura as a \glossterm{minor action}.

        \subparhead{Chaos} When a target rolls a 1 on an attack roll with a \glossterm{strike}, it \glossterm{explodes} (see \pcref{Exploding Attacks}.
        This does not affect bonus dice rolled for exploding attacks (see \pcref{Exploding Attacks}).
        \subparhead{Evil} Once per round, when a target loses a \glossterm{hit point}, you may cause it to lose an additional \glossterm{hit point}.
        If multiple targets lose hit points simultaneously, you may freely choose which target suffers this effect.
        % TODO: clarify what happens if multiple people try to Good aura the same target
        \subparhead{Good} When a target gains a \glossterm{vital wound}, you may gain a \glossterm{vital wound} instead.
        You gain a \plus2 bonus to the \glossterm{wound roll} for each \glossterm{vital wound} you gain this way.
        The target suffers any other effects of the attack normally.
        \subparhead{Law} When a target rolls a 1 on an attack roll with a \glossterm{strike}, the attack roll is treated as a 6.
        This does not affect bonus dice rolled for exploding attacks (see \pcref{Exploding Attacks}).

        \cf{Pal}[2]{Aligned Immunity}[Magical]
        Your ability to resist attacks based on your alignment improves.

        \subparhead{Chaos} You are immune to hostile \glossterm{Compulsion} abilities.
        \subparhead{Evil} You are immune to poisons and diseases.
        \subparhead{Good} You are immune to being \glossterm{shaken}, \glossterm{frightened}, and \glossterm{panicked}.
        \subparhead{Law} You are immune to hostile \glossterm{Emotion} abilities.

        \cf{Pal}[3]{Paragon Power}
        You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{power} with \glossterm{magical} abilities.

        \cf{Pal}[4]{Greater Aligned Aura}[Magical]
        The effect of your \textit{aligned aura} becomes stronger, as described below.

        \subparhead{Chaos} The effect applies to all attacks, not just \glossterm{strikes}.
        \subparhead{Evil} Once per round, when a target gains a \glossterm{vital wound}, you may cause it to gain an additional \glossterm{vital wound}.
        You may make this choice independently from the choice of which target loses an additional \glossterm{hit point}.
        \subparhead{Good} When a target loses a \glossterm{hit point}, you may lose that hit point instead.
        The target suffers any other effects of the attack normally.
        \subparhead{Law} The effect applies to all attacks, not just \glossterm{strikes}.

        \cf{Pal}[5]{Devoted Mind} You gain a \plus2 bonus to Mental defense.

        \cf{Pal}[6]{Greater Paragon Power} The bonus from your \textit{paragon power} ability increases to \plus2.

        \cf{Pal}[7]{Supreme Aligned Aura}
        The area of your \textit{aligned aura} increases to a \arealarge radius \glossterm{emanation} from you.

        \cf{Pal}[8]{Aligned Soul}[Magical]
        While you are dead, you may approach the deity or governing figure of your afterlife and request to be returned to life to continue your mission.
        Travelling to the relevant entity and making the request takes 12 hours.
        This request is almost always granted unless there are extenuating circumstances.
        You are resurrected in a new body at a location of the entity's choice, which is usually a place of power for the entity.
        This functions like the \ritual{resurrection} ritual, except that no part of the body is required, and a new body is created by the entity.
        You can be resurrected in this way regardless of the condition of your body, but not if your soul has been trapped or otherwise prevented from going to the correct afterlife.

    \subsection{Divine Spellcasting}
        This archetype grants you the ability to cast divine spells.
        You must have a starting Willpower of at least 1 to gain this archetype.

        \cf{Pal}[1]{Spellcasting}[Magical]
        Your devotion to your alignment grants you the ability to use divine magic.
        You gain access to one divine \glossterm{mystic sphere} (see \pcref{Divine Mystic Spheres}).
        You may spend \glossterm{insight points} to learn one additional \glossterm{mystic sphere} per two \glossterm{insight points}.
        Each \glossterm{mystic sphere} has a set of \glossterm{spells} associated with it.

        You automatically learn all \glossterm{cantrips} from any mystic sphere you have access to.
        In addition, you learn one rank 1 \glossterm{spell} from your chosen \glossterm{mystic sphere}.
        You can also spend \glossterm{insight points} to learn one additional divine spell per \glossterm{insight point}.
        Unless otherwise noted in a spell's description, casting a spell requires a \glossterm{standard action}.

        When you gain access to a new \glossterm{mystic sphere} or spell \glossterm{rank},
            you can exchange any number of spells you know for other spells,
            including spells of the higher rank.

        Divine spells require \glossterm{verbal components} to cast (see \pcref{Casting Components}).
        For details about mystic spheres and casting spells, see \pcref{Spell and Ritual Mechanics}.

        \cf{Pal}[2]{Battle Prayer} Your divine spells do not have the \glossterm{Focus} ability tag, allowing you to cast them without lowering your guard in combat.

            \rankline
            \rank{3} The bonus increases to \plus3.
            \rank{5} When you use this ability, you can spend an \glossterm{action point}.

            This ability does not affect attunement to magic items.

            \rankline

            The target of your \textit{smite} is treated as if it had the alignment opposed to your devoted alignment for the purpose of all abilities, including for your initial \textit{smite}.
            This only affects its alignment along the alignment axis your devoted alignment is on.
            For example, if your devoted alignment was evil, a chaotic neutral target would be treated as chaotic good.

            You can use this ability to do battle against foes who share your alignment, but you should exercise caution in doing so.
            Persecution of those who share your ideals can lead you to fall and become an ex-paladin.
        \end{attuneability}

        \cf{Pal}[5]{Greater Zealous Conviction} The bonus from your \textit{zealous conviction} ability increases to \plus2.

        \cf{Pal}[6]{Zealous Offense} You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy}.

        \cf{Pal}[7]{Greater Pass Judgment} Your \textit{pass judgment} ability loses the \glossterm{Attune} tag.
        Instead, it lasts until you decide to lift your judgment on the target as a \glossterm{free action}.

        % TODO: Doesn't work with new spell system
        % \cf{Pal}[20]{Martyr's Retribution}[Mag]
        % If you die in the service of your devoted alignment, you may choose to have your fallen body erupt in an immense burst of divine energy.
        % If you do, your body is almost completely consumed, preventing you from being raised with \ritual{resurrection} and similar effects that require an intact body.
        % This burst has two effects.
        % First, a \spell{sunburst} spell immediately takes effect over the area where you died.
        % Second, a \spell{storm of vengeance} spell begins to take effect, centered on the same area.
        % The spell lasts for 10 rounds, and the lightning strikes target the paladin's enemies.
        % Both of these effects harm only the paladin's foes, and do not harm your allies.
        % However, your allies' vision is still impeded by the \spell{storm of vengeance}.

    \subsection{Ex-Paladins}
        If you cease to follow your devoted alignment, you lose all \glossterm{magical} paladin class abilities.
        If your atone for your misdeeds and resume the service of your devoted alignment, you can regain your abilities.

    \classbasics{Alignment} Any.

    \classbasics{Archetypes} Warlocks have the Pact Spellcasting, Pact Spell Mastery, and Blessings of the Abyss \glossterm{archetypes}.

    \subsection{Basic Class Abilities}
        If you are a warlock, you gain the following abilities.

        \cf{War}{Defenses}
        You gain the following bonuses to your \glossterm{defenses}: \plus4 Fortitude, \plus3 Reflex, \plus5 Mental.

        \cf{War}{Skills}
        You have the following \glossterm{class skills}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \subparhead{Dexterity} Ride.
            \item \subparhead{Intelligence} Craft, Deduction, Disguise, Knowledge (arcana, planes, religion), Linguistics.
            \item \subparhead{Perception} Awareness, Sense Motive, Spellcraft.
            \item \subparhead{Other} Bluff, Intimidate, Persuasion, Profession.
        \end{itemize}

        \cf{War}{Weapon and Armor Proficiencies}
        You are proficient with simple weapons, any two other weapon groups, light and medium armor, and shields.
        Encumbrance from armor interferes with the gestures you make to cast spells, which can cause your spells with somatic components to fail (see \pcref{Somatic Component Failure}).

        \cf{War}{Infernal Pact}[Magical]
        To become a warlock, you must make a pact with a powerful demon or devil.
        % TODO: wording; intended to prevent Null warlocks who have no pact
        If you somehow lose this ability, you lose all other warlock abilities.
        You must make a dark sacrifice, the details of which are subject to negotiation, and offer a part of your immortal soul.
        In exchange, you gain the powers of a warlock.
        The creature you make the pact with is called your soulkeeper.

        Offering your soul to an entity in this way grants it the ability to communicate with you in limited ways.
        This communication typically manifests as unnatural emotional urges or whispered voices audible only to you.

        Your pact specifies how much of your soul is granted to your soulkeeper, and the circumstances of the transfer.
        The most common arrangement is for a soulkeeper to gain possession of your soul immediately after you die.
        It will keep the soul for one decade per year of your life that you spend as a warlock.
        During that time, it will not prevent you from being resurrected.
        At the end of that time, if your soul remains intact, your soul will pass on to its intended afterlife.
        However, other arrangements are possible, and each warlock's pact can be unique.

        The longer you spend in an afterlife that is not your own, the more likely you are to lose your sense of self and become subsumed by the plane you are on.
        Only a soul of extraordinary strength can maintain its integrity after decades or centuries in the Abyss.
        Many warlocks seek power zealously while mortal to gain the mental fortitude necessary to keep their soul after death.

        \cf{War}{Whispers of the Lost}[Magical]
        You hear the voices of souls lost to the Abyss, linked to you through your soulkeeper.
        Choose one of the following types of whispers that you hear.
        {
            \subcf{Mentoring Whispers} You hear the voice of a dead warlock whose soul is bound to the same soulkeeper as yours.

            \subcf{Spiteful Whispers} You hear the voices of cruel souls who berate you for your flaws and mistakes.

            \subcf{Sycophantic Whispers} You hear the voices of adoring souls who praise your talents and everything you do.

            \subcf{Warning Whispers} You hear the voices of paranoid and fearful souls warning you of danger, both real and imagined.

            \subcf{Whispers of the Mighty} Your soulkeeper forges the connection to your soul into a boon granted to any soul in the Abyss strong enough to claim it in battle.
            You hear the voice of whatever soul currently possesses the boon, which may change suddenly and unexpectedly.
        }

    \subsection{Blessings of the Abyss}
        This archetype enhances your connection to the Abyss and allows you to channel its sinister power more directly.

            \rank{7} The damage penalty is removed.

        \cf{War}[4]{Abyssal Substitution} Whenever you use a \glossterm{magical} ability that deals \glossterm{energy damage} or any subtype of \glossterm{energy damage}, you may change the type of damage it deals to be fire damage.
        Any other aspects of the ability remain unchanged.

        \end{freeability}

        \cf{War}[7]{Greater Abyssal Substitution} Whenever you use an ability that deals damage, you may change the type of damage it deals to be fire damage.

        You must have a starting Willpower of at least 1 to gain this archetype.

        \cf{War}[1]{Spellcasting}[Magical]
        Your soulkeeper grants you the ability to use pact magic.
        You gain access to one pact \glossterm{mystic sphere} (see \pcref{Pact Mystic Spheres}).
        Each \glossterm{mystic sphere} has a set of \glossterm{spells} associated with it.
        You may spend \glossterm{insight points} to learn one additional \glossterm{mystic sphere} per two \glossterm{insight points}.

        You automatically learn all \glossterm{cantrips} from any mystic sphere you have access to.

        You can also spend \glossterm{insight points} to learn one additional pact spell per \glossterm{insight point}.
        Unless otherwise noted in a spell's description, casting a spell requires a \glossterm{standard action}.

        When you gain access to a new \glossterm{mystic sphere} or spell \glossterm{rank},
            you can exchange any number of spells you know for other spells,
            including spells of the higher rank.

        Pact spells require require both \glossterm{verbal components} and \glossterm{somatic components} to cast (see \pcref{Casting Components}).
