\chapter{Classes}\label{Classes}

Your character's class represents the things your character has chosen to train in.
This choice determines a great deal about your character's abilities.

\section{How Classes Work}
    When you first create a character, you choose a class.
    Your character has one level in that class.
    This grants your character all of the abilities your chosen class grants at 1st level, as given in the class description.
    Each time your character gains a level, you can choose to increase your level in your original class or gain a level in a new class.
    This grants your character all of the abilities your chosen class grants at the level your character just gained in it.

    \subsection{Base Classes}
        Every character has one \glossterm{base class}.
        You may choose any class your character has at least one level in as a base class.
        Whenever your character gain a level, you can change its base class to a different class it has.
        Your choice of base class affects your character's \glossterm{defenses}, \glossterm{skill points}, and \glossterm{class skills}.
        In addition, every class grants additional abilities if it is chosen as a base class, as given in the class description.

\section{Class Introductions}

    There are eleven classes in Rise.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Barbarians are mighty warriors who can enter a deadly battlerage.
        \item Clerics are divine spellcasters who draw power from their veneration of a deity or ideal.
        \item Druids are nature spellcasters who draw power from their veneration of the natural world.
        \item Fighters are highly disciplined warriors who excel in physical combat of any variety.
        \item Wizards are arcane spellcasters who wield the mystic forces of magic to create almost any effect.
        \item Monks are agile masters of ``\ki'' who hone their personal abilities to strike down foes and perform supernatural feats.
        \item Paladins are divinely empowered warriors whose devotion to an alignment grants them the ability to discern and smite their foes.
        \item Rangers are skilled hunters who bridge the divide between nature and civilization.
        \item Rogues are exceptionally skillful characters known for their ability to strike at their foe's weak points in combat.
        \item Spellwarped wield a unique blend of martial skill and narrowly focused magical abilities.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Class Description Format}
        Each class is described from the perspective of a member of that class, using ``you'' in the description.

        \parhead{Class Table}
        The class's table describes the special abilities they get at each level.

        \parhead{Alignment}
        Some classes require specific alignments (see \pcref{Alignment}).
        Most classes allow characters of any alignment.

        \parhead{Class Skills}
        These are skills that members of this class are typically good at (see \pcref{Skills}).

        \subsubsection{Base Class Abilities}
            Abilities contained within this heading only apply to characters with the current class as a \glossterm{base class}.

            \parhead{Skill Points}
            This is the number of skill points that members of this class get.

            \parhead{Defenses}
            Each class grants bonuses to specific defenses.
            These bonuses do not stack with other defense bonuses granted by base classes.
            If a character has multiple base classes, use the highest bonuses that apply to each defense.

            \parhead{Weapon and Armor Proficiencies}
            These are the types of equipment that members of this class are trained in using.

        \subsubsection{Class Abilities}

        \cf{Clr}{Domains}
        A cleric chooses two domains which represent your personal spiritual inclinations.
        He must choose your domains from among those your deity offers.
        A cleric's choice of domains has broad effects on the cleric's spellcasting and abilities.
        The domains are listed below.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item{Air}
            \item{Chaos}

        \end{itemize}

        \cf{Clr}{Divine Power}
        The strength of a cleric's spells and abilities are determined by your divine power.
        Your divine power is equal to your character level or your Willpower, whichever is higher.

        \cf{Clr}{Spells}
        A cleric casts divine spells using your devotion.
        The maximum spell level a cleric can cast is equal to half your cleric level.
        A cleric's \glossterm{spellpower} with divine spells is equal to your divine power.

        A 1st-level cleric knows two spells.
        Every even level, he learns an additional spell.
        In addition, each time he gains a level, he may trade one of your existing spells for a different spell known.
        He may learn spells from the divine \glossterm{spell list} (see \pcref{Divine Spells}).
        In addition, he adds the spells from your domains to your divine spell list (see \pcref{Cleric Domains}).
        Sometimes these domain spells are spells that are normally available to divine spellcasters, but often they are only accessible with the domain.

        To cast a spell, a cleric must normally spend an \glossterm{action point}.
        Every spell can also be cast as a cantrip.
        Cantrips are weaker, but do not require action points to cast.

        A cleric can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to your own or your deity's.
        Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.

        Once per week, the cleric can request a miracle as a standard action.
        He mentally specifies your request, and your deity fulfills that request in the manner it sees fit.

        If the deity has a direct interest in the cleric's situation, the miracle may be of even greater power.

        If the cleric performs an extraordinary service for your deity, he can gain the ability to request an additional miracle that week.

            If he summons Death, the target immediately dies if it takes vital damage.
            If he banishes Death, the target is immune to Death effects and does not make \glossterm{stabilization rolls} if it takes vital damage.

            Success means the target takes an evil action as soon as it can.
            The cleric has no control over the act the creature takes, but circumstances can make the target more likely to take an action the cleric desires.
            Creatures who have strict codes prohibiting them from taking evil actions, such as paladins devoted to Good, are immune to this effect.
            This is a [\glossterm{Compulsion}, \glossterm{Mind}] effect.

            Success means the target takes a good action as soon as it can.
            The cleric has no control over the act the creature takes, but circumstances can make the target more likely to take an action the cleric desires.
            Creatures who have strict codes prohibiting them from taking good actions, such as paladins devoted to Evil, are immune to this effect.
            This is a [\glossterm{Compulsion}, \glossterm{Mind}] effect.

            \subcf{Knowledge -- Impart Truth}
            As a standard action, the cleric can spend a devotion point to grant knowledge.
            He may make a Knowledge check of any kind with a \plus20 bonus to the check.
            He may also cause any number of creatures within a \arealarge radius around you to learn the results of your check.
            Creatures granted knowledge in this way believe the information to be true as if they had seen it with their own eyes.
            Exceptionally stubborn or untrusting creatures may still not be convinced of its truth, however.

            \subcf{Law -- Infallible Enforcement}
            As a standard action, the cleric can spend a devotion point to enforce the law in a \arealarge radius \glossterm{zone} centered on you.
            He makes a Divine power vs. Mental attack against all creatures in the area.
            Success means the target is unable to break the law, and any attempt to do so simply fails.
            Failure means the target feels a compulsion not to break the law, but is able to overcome the compulsion if it desires.
            The laws which are applied are those which are most appropriate for the area, regardless of whether the cleric or any other creature know those laws.
            If the rightful laws are inconsistent or impossible to understand, those laws may not be enforced.
            This is a [\glossterm{Compulsion}, \glossterm{Mind}] effect.

            \subcf{Life -- Prayer of Resurrection}
            As a standard action, the cleric can resurrect a touched creature, as the effect of the \spell{resurrection} ritual.
            The target must have been dead for no more than 5 minutes.
            He must spend a number of devotion points equal to the target's level.
            He does not know the cost before resurrecting the target.
            If the cost exceeds your remaining devotion points, all your devotion points are spent, but the resurrection still succeeds as long as he spent at least one devotion point in this way.

            \subcf{Magic -- Manipulate Spell}
            As a standard action, the cleric can spend a devotion point to manipulate a currently active spell within \rngmed range.
            He must make a Divine power check against a DR equal to 10 \add the spell's spellpower.
            Success means he identifies the spell perfectly, if he had not already done so, and can take one of the following four actions on the spell.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Control: If the spell can be focused on to gain an effect or extend its duration, the cleric gains the ability to focus on the spell as if he was the one who originally cast it.
                    Its original caster loses the ability to focus on the spell.
                \item Dispel: The spell is dispelled, if it can be dispelled by \spell{dispel magic}.
                \item Persist: The spell's remaining duration increases by 5 minutes, up to a maximum of its starting duration (ignoring any duration increase from focusing on the spell).
                \item Suppress: The spell is suppressed for 5 rounds, if it can be dispelled by \spell{dispel magic}.
                    At the end of that time, the spell's effect resumes, if it still has duration remaining.
            \end{itemize}

            \subcf{Protection -- Divine Shield}
            As a standard action, the cleric can create a powerful protective shield around a creature or object within \rngclose range for 5 rounds.
            The target takes half damage from all attacks.
            In addition, whenever the target takes damage, the cleric can spend a devotion point as an immediate action to negate that damage.

            \subcf{Strength -- Might of the Gods}
            As a standard action, the cleric can spend a devotion point to gain titanic strength for 5 minutes.
            For the purpose of checks and determining carrying capacity, the cleric's Strength becomes equal to 10 \add your divine power.
            If he takes damage, the effect ends.

            \subcf{Travel -- Transcend Movement}
            As a standard action, the cleric can spend a devotion point to teleport himself, as the effect of the \spell{teleport} ritual.

            \subcf{Trickery -- Enduring Falsehood}
            As a standard action, the cleric can delude a creature within \rngmed range into believing a lie, regardless of evidence.
            He chooses a falsehood and makes a Divine power vs. Mental attack against the creature.
            The falsehood may be a lie, or a simple misunderstanding (such as believing a hidden creature is not present in a room).
            If the creature does not already believe the falsehood, the attack automatically fails.

            Success means that the target continues to believe the falsehood for 5 minutes, regardless of any evidence to the contrary.
            It will interpret any evidence that the falsehood is incorrect to be somehow wrong -- an illusion, a conspiracy to decieve it, or any other reason it can think of to continue believing the falsehood.
            At the end of the effect, the creature can decide whether it believes the falsehood or not, as normal.
            This is a [\glossterm{Delusion}, \glossterm{Mind}] effect.

            \subcf{War -- Mass Combat}
            As an immediate action, the cleric can spend a devotion point to augment a spell he casts with one of the following effects.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Legion: If the spell would normally affect five or more specific targets, its range is doubled and it instead affects five times that many targets.
                \item Selective: If the spell has an area, it has no effect on your allies in the area.
                \item Widened: If the spell has an area, the size of the area is doubled.
            \end{itemize}

            \subcf{Water -- Command Water}
            As a standard action, the cleric can spend a devotion point to speak with and command water for 5 minutes.
            He can ask the water simple questions and understand its responses.
            If he commands the water to perform a task, it will do so do the best of its ability until the end of the effect's duration.
            The cleric cannot compel the earth to move faster than 30 feet per round, and cannot effect water farther than 500 feet from you.

        \subsubsection{Domain Masteries}\label{Domain Masteries}

            \subcf{Air -- Flight}
            The cleric gains a fly speed with good maneuverability equal to your land speed.
            While \unencumbered, he can fly.
            See \pcref{Flying}, for more details.
            \subcf{Chaos -- Avatar of Luck}
            Once per round, the cleric can gain a \plus1d6 bonus to any check or physical attack.
            He may declare the use of the ability after failing the roll, but before any additional effects are resolved, potentially making it succeed where it would have failed.
            \subcf{Death -- Deathfeeder}
            The cleric constantly radiates a \arealarge radius emanation of death.
            Whenever an enemy takes damage in the area, all damage in excess of its hit points is dealt as \glossterm{vital damage}.
            In addition, whenever a creature dies within the area, the cleric gains temporary hit points equal to twice your divine power.
            \subcf{Destruction -- Beacon of Destruction}
            The cleric constantly radiates a \arealarge radius emanation of destruction.
            All enemies and objects in the area have their \glossterm{damage reduction} and \glossterm{hardness} reduced by an amount equal to twice the cleric's divine power.
            \subcf{Earth -- Earth Glide}
            The cleric gains the earth glide ability, as an earth elemental.
            \subcf{Evil -- Avatar of Evil} The cleric continuously gains the benefits of the \spell{protection from good}
            spell, with a spellpower equal to your divine power.
            If the effect is dispelled or suppressed, he can resume it as a swift action.
            \subcf{Fire -- Flaming Soul}
            The cleric becomes immune to fire damage.
            In addition, whenever he deals fire damage to a creature, that creature is \ignited for 5 rounds.
            \subcf{Good -- Avatar of Good} The cleric continuously gains the benefits of the \spell{protection from evil}
            spell, with a spellpower equal to your divine power.
            If the effect is dispelled or suppressed, he can resume it as a swift action.
            \subcf{Knowledge -- Combat Insight}
            The cleric gains a \plus2 bonus to accuracy, checks, and defenses against non-humanoid creatures he has identified with a successful Knowledge check.
            \subcf{Law -- Avatar of Order}
            Once per round, if the cleric rolls less than a 10 on a d20, he may treat the result as if it were a 10, potentially causing you to succeed where he would have failed.
            You must declare the use of this ability before any additional effects from the roll are resolved.
            \subcf{Life -- }
            \subcf{Magic -- Spellfeeder}
            The cleric gains \glossterm{magic resistance} equal to 10 \add divine power.
            Whenever the cleric resists a spell with this magic resistance, he regains hit points equal to your divine power.
            \subcf{Protection -- Martyr's Boon}
            The cleric constantly radiates a \areamed radius emanation of protective energy.
            Whenever a creature within the area would lose hit points, the cleric can choose to protect it.
            If he does, the protected creature instead loses half that many hit points (rounded down), and he loses the other half (rounded up).
            This effect applies after damage reduction and all other similar effects, and hit point loss caused by this effect cannot be reduced in any way.
            If he takes damage in excess of your hit points in this way, the excess damage is dealt directly as vital damage.
            \subcf{Strength -- Might of the Gods}
            The cleric gains the larger than life ability, as the barbarian class ability (see Larger than Life, \pref{Bbn:Larger than Life}).
            \subcf{Travel -- Perfect Stride}
            You are immune to effects that restrict its mobility. In addition, he gains a \plus20 bonus to Reflex defense against grapple attacks, as well as on grapple attacks or Escape Artist checks made to escape a grapple or a pin.
            \subcf{Trickery -- Exemplar of Deceit} The cleric continuously gains the benefits of the \spell{nondetection}
            spell, with a spellpower equal to your divine power, except that it also protects you from any spells or effects which would prevent you from lying or reveal your lies.
            If the effect is dispelled or suppressed, he can resume it as a swift action.
            \subcf{War -- Warmaster's Favor} The cleric continuously gains the benefits of the \spell{divine favor}
            spell, with a spellpower equal to your divine power.
            If the effect is dispelled or suppressed, he can resume it as a swift action.
            \subcf{Water -- Water's Flow}
            As a swift action, the cleric can transform himself into a rushing flow of water with a volume roughly equal to your normal volume until the end of your turn.
            In this form, he may move wherever water could go, but he cannot take other actions, such as jumping, attacking, or casting spells.
            Your speed is halved when moving uphill and doubled when moving downhill.
            He may move through squares occupied by creatures or threatened by blocking enemies without penalty.
            He may return to your normal form as a free action.
            \par If the water is split, he may reform from anywhere the water has reached, to as little as a single ounce of water.
            If not even an ounce of water exists contiguously, your body reforms from the largest available parts of water, cut into pieces of appropriate size.
            This usually causes the cleric to die.
            \subcf{Wild -- \tdash}

        \subsubsection{Ex-Clerics}
            A cleric who grossly violates the code of conduct required by your deity loses all spells and magical cleric class abilities.
            He cannot thereafter gain levels as a cleric of that god until he atones (see the \spell{atonement} spell description).

    \subsection{Base Class Abilities}
        A character with druid as a base class gains the following abilities.

        \classbasics{Skill Points} 10.

        \classbasics{Defenses} \plus4 Fortitude, \plus2 Mental.

        \classbasics{Action Points} \plus3.

        \cf{Drd}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
        Druids are proficient with simple weapons, any one other weapon group, scimitars, sickles, and slings.
        In addition, druids are proficient with light armor, medium armor, and shields.
        However, a druid cannot use metal armor; see the Metal Abhorrence ability, below.

        \cf{Drd}{Druidic Language}
        Druids know Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, in addition to their normal languages.
        Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.
        Druidic has its own alphabet.

        \cf{Drd}{Wild Speech}[Mag]
        Druids can communicate with animals.
        As a standard action, the druid can spend an action point and choose a type of animal, such as owl or wolf.
        She gains the ability to speak to and understand animals of that type for 5 minutes.

        This ability doesn't make the animals any more friendly or cooperative than normal.
        Furthermore, wary and cunning animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while the more stupid ones make inane comments.
        If an animal is friendly toward the druid, she may be able to convince it to do some favor or service.

        \cf{Drd}{Spell Point}
        The druid gains a spell point.
        A spell point can be spent to cast spells in place of an action point.
        She recovers all spent spell points after a \glossterm{short rest}.

    \subsection{Class Abilities}
        All druids have the following abilities.

        \cf{Drd}{Metal Abhorrence}[Mag]
        The oaths that druids swear as part of their initiation prohibit them from wearing armor made of metal.
        A druid who wears prohibited armor or carries a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of your \glossterm{magical} class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter (not including this ability).
        
        A druid can avoid this penalty by using armor made of wood altered with the \spell{ironwood} ritual.
        Such wood is as strong as steel.

        \cf{Drd}{Nature Power}
        The strength of a druid's spells and abilities are determined by your connection to nature.
        Your nature power is equal to your character level or your Perception, whichever is higher.

        \cf{Drd}{Spells}
        A druid casts nature spells using your connection to nature.
        The maximum spell level a druid can cast is equal to half your druid level.
        A druid's \glossterm{spellpower} with nature spells is equal to your nature power.

        A 1st-level druid knows two spells.
        Every even level, you learn an additional spell.
        In addition, each time you gain a level, she may trade one of your existing spells for a different spell known.
        A druid's spells are drawn from the spells on the nature spell list (see \pcref{Nature Spells}).

        To cast a spell, a druid must spend an \glossterm{action point}.
        Every spell can also be cast as a cantrip.
        Cantrips are weaker, but do not require action points to cast.

        \cf{Drd}{Rituals}
        Druids can perform nature rituals to create unique magical effects (see \pcref{Rituals}).
        A druid begins play with a ritual book containing two nature rituals of your choice (see \pcref{Nature Rituals}).

        \cf{Drd}[2nd]{Wild Aspect}[Mag]
        The druid gains the ability to embody an aspect of an animal or of nature itself.
        She chooses two wild aspects from the list below.
        Some wild aspects have minimum druid levels, as indicated in the title of the aspect.
        At your 3rd druid level, and every odd druid level thereafter, the druid learns an additional wild aspect.

        Unless otherwise noted, embodying a wild aspect is a standard action.
        Embodying a wild aspect costs an \glossterm{action point}.
        Once embodied, a wild aspect persists until the druid embodies a new aspect or dismisses the aspect.
        If the druid embodies a new wild aspect, the previous aspect ends immediately.
        All wild aspects can be dismissed as a swift action.

        The descriptions below describe the effects of the aspect.
        With many aspects, the druid's appearance also changes to match the aspect, but this is not described.
        Different druids change in different ways.
        For example, one druid might gain unusually large eyes when embodying the low-light vision aspect, while another might change your irises into slits, like a cat, when embodying the same aspect.
        The changes made are up to the druid, but cannot be used to gain an additional substantive benefit beyond the effects given in the description of the aspect.

        Many wild aspects grant natural weapons.
        See \pcref{Natural Weapons}, for details about natural weapons.

        \subcf{Armaments of the Bear}
        The druid's mouth and hands transform, allowing your to perform bite and claw attacks.
        The bite attack deals 1d8 damage for a Medium druid, and the claws deal 1d6 damage.
        \subcf{Senses}
        The druid, gains low-light vision.
        She treats sources of light as if they had double their normal illumination range.
        If she already has low-light vision, you double its benefit, allowing your to treat sources of light as if they had four times their normal illumination range.
        In addition, you gain \glossterm{darkvision} out to 50 feet, allowing your to see in complete darkness.
        If she already has darkvision, you increase its range by 50 feet.
        \subcf{Woodland Stride}
        The druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at your normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.
        The plants bend of their own volition to allow the druid to pass.
        However, plants magically manipulated to impede motion still affect your.

        \subcf{5th -- Animal Affinity}
        The druid gains a \plus5 bonus to Creature Handling and Ride checks.
        \subcf{5th -- Climb}
        The druid gains a \glossterm{climb speed} equal to your land speed.
        \subcf{5th -- Constrict}
        The druid's body transforms, improving your grappling abilities.
        She gains a \plus5 bonus to accuracy with grapple attacks.
        In addition, you gain a constrict attack.
        This attack deals 1d10 damage for a Medium druid, but it can only be used against a foe you i grappling with.
        \subcf{5th -- Gore}
        The druid's head transforms, allowing your to perform a gore attack.
        The attack deals 1d8 damage for a Medium druid.
        In addition, if the druid hits with a natural attack, she may attempt to shove your foe as an immediate action.

        \subcf{7th -- A Thousand Faces}
        The druid's appearance changes, as if using the \spell{disguise self} spell.
        This affects the druid's body, but not your possessions.
        It is not an illusory effect, but a minor physical alteration of the druid's appearance, within the limits described for the spell.
        \subcf{7th -- Enhanced Natural Weapons}
        The druid's natural weapons gain a \glossterm{enhancement bonus} equal to one third of your nature power.
        This functions like an enhancement bonus on a weapon, increasing your damage and offensive legend points per day (see \pcref{Weapon Enhancement Bonuses}).
        \subcf{7th -- Hawk}
        The druid grows wings, granting your a glide speed equal to your land speed.
        See \pcref{Gliding}, for more details.
        In addition, your feet transform, allowing your to perform a talon attack.
        The attack deals 1d6 damage for a Medium druid.
        \subcf{7th -- Lope}
        The druid gains the ability to move on all four limbs.
        When doing so, you gain a \plus30 foot bonus to your land speed, up to a maximum of double your original speed.
        When not using your hands to move, your ability to use your hands is unchanged.
        \subcf{7th -- Scent}
        The druid gains the \glossterm{scent} ability.
        \subcf{7th -- Shrink}
        The druid shrinks by a size category.
        This functions like the \spell{reduce person} spell.
        This is a sizing effect.
        \subcf{7th -- Slither}
        The druid gains a \glossterm{climb speed} equal to your land speed.
        She does not need to use your hands to climb in this way.
        In addition, you gain a bite attack that deals 1d8 damage for a Medium druid.
        \subcf{7th -- Spikes}
        Whenever a creature adjacent to the druid makes a physical attack against your, the attacking creature takes 1d6 piercing damage per two nature power.
        A creature can only be dealt damage by this effect once per round.

        \subcf{9th -- Barkskin} The druid gains \glossterm{damage reduction} against physical damage equal to your nature power.
        Fire damage ignores this damage reduction and negates it for 1 round.
        \subcf{9th -- Natural Grab}
        If the druid hits with a natural attack, she may attempt to grapple your foe as an immediate action.
        \subcf{9th -- Natural Trip}
        If the druid hits with a natural attack, she may attempt to trip your foe as an immediate action.
        \subcf{9th -- Venom}
        If the druid hits with a natural attack, she may inject poison into your foe as an immediate action.
        At the end of every round, the druid makes a nature power vs. Fortitude attack against all creatures you ha poisoned.
        The effects of the poison are described below.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item First success: the target is \sickened.

        \par In addition, the druid gains a bite attack that deals 1d8 damage for a Medium druid.

        \subcf{11th -- Elemental Retribution}
        Whenever a creature within \rngmed range of the druid attacks your, the attacking creature takes 1d6 damage per two nature power of either cold, electricity, or fire damage.
        The druid may choose the damage type independently for each attacking creature.
        A creature can only be dealt damage by this effect once per round.
        \subcf{11th -- Fluid Motion} You are immune to effects that restrict its mobility. She suffers no penalties for acting underwater. In addition, you gain a \plus20 bonus to Reflex defense against grapple attacks, as well as on grapple attacks or Escape Artist checks made to escape a grapple or a pin.
        \subcf{11th -- Grow}
        The druid increases in size by one size category, as the effect of the \spell{enlarge} spell.
        This is a \glossterm{Sizing} effect, and does not stack with other Sizing effects.
        \subcf{11th -- Natural Renewal}
        At the end of each round, the druid heals hit points equal to your nature power.
        \subcf{11th -- Wolfpack}
        Overwhelmed foes the druid threatens increase their overwhelm penalties by 2.

        \subcf{13th -- Swiftstrike}
        The druid's attack speed increases.
        When you make a standard attack, she may make an additional strike.
        This strike must be made with a natural weapon.
        This effect does not stack with similar effects that grant extra strikes.
        \subcf{13th -- Wings}
        The druid grows wings, granting your a fly speed equal to your land speed.
        While \unencumbered, she can fly (see \pcref{Flying}).
        She can only fly for a number of rounds equal to half your nature power.
        After that limit is reached, she must rest for 5 minutes before flying again.

        \subcf{15th -- Earth Glide}
        The druid gains the earth glide ability, as an earth elemental.
        This allows your to glide through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth as if it were air.
        She can walk or climb at any angle in the earth.
        However, she cannot breathe, speak, or hear while gliding in this way.
        While gliding, she can remain partially within the earth, granting it cover.
        She can only glide through earth for a number of rounds equal to half your nature power.
        After that limit is reached, she must rest for 5 minutes before gliding through earth again.

        \subcf{19th -- Solar Radiance}
        The druid continuously radiates bright light out to a 500 foot radius (and shadowy illumination for an additional 500 feet).
        The illumination is so bright that you become hard to look at.
        Any creature attacking your from within the radius of bright light becomes \partiallyblinded for 2 rounds after the attack.

\begin{comment}
    \subcf{15th -- Air Mantle}
    You are surrounded by a mantle of air.
    Thrown and projectile weapons have a 50\% chance to miss your while this effect is active.
    Unusually large weapons, such as a giant's boulders, may suffer a decreased miss chance as appropriate to their size.
    \subcf{15th -- Aqueous Step}
    Wherever the druid moves, you leave a path of animated water that can grab creatures.
    Whenever a creature crosses the path, the druid makes a Reflex attack to trip the creature, causing it to fall prone and waste the rest of its movement.
    Your accuracy is equal to your druid level \add your Constitution.
    \subcf{15th -- Flaming Step}
    Wherever the druid moves, you leave a path of burning flame behind your that lasts for 1 round.
    Whenever a creature crosses the path, the druid makes a Reflex attack to deal damage to the creature.
    The attack deals 1d8 points of fire damage per two druid levels.
    Your accuracy is equal to your druid level \add your Constitution.
    A failed attack deals half damage.
    \subcf{15th -- Lifegiving Step}
    Wherever the druid moves, you leave a path of small, living plants that entangle foes for 1 round.
    Whenever a creature crosses the path, the druid makes a Reflex attack to entangle the creature, causing it to waste the rest of its movement.
    Your accuracy is equal to your druid level \add your Constitution.
    The plants appear on any surface, and will continue to grow if they can survive, though they may die quickly if they appear on inhospitable terrain.
    \subcf{17th -- Flaming Soul}
    The druid gains the fire subtype, making your immune to fire but giving your a 50\% vulnerability to cold damage.
    In addition, whenever you deal fire damage to a creature, the creature is \ignited for 5 rounds.
    \subcf{17th -- Sunblessed Rejuvenation}
    The druid gains fast healing equal to your druid level as long as you remain in sunlight or touches a plant of your size or larger.
    \subcf{17th -- Sunscour}
    This aspect functions like the heart of the sun natural aspect, except that it also suppresses shadow effects and the visual components of illusions within the area of bright light.

    \subcf{17th -- Water's Flow}
    As a swift action, the druid can transform herself into a rushing flow of water with a volume roughly equal to your normal volume until the end of your turn.
    In this form, she may move wherever water could go, but she cannot take other actions, such as jumping, attacking, or casting spells.
    Your speed is halved when moving uphill and doubled when moving downhill.
    She may move through squares occupied by creatures or threatened by blocking enemies without penalty.
    She may return to your normal form as a free action.
    \par If the water is split, she may reform from anywhere the water has reached, to as little as a single ounce of water.
    If not even an ounce of water exists contiguously, your body reforms from the largest available parts of water, cut into pieces of appropriate size.
    This usually causes the druid to die.

\end{comment}

        \cf{Drd}[5th]{Multiple Aspect}[Mag]
        The druid gains the ability to embody two wild aspects at once.
        At 9th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the druid gains the ability to embody an additional wild aspect at the same time.

    \cf{Drd}[20th]{Avatar of Nature}[Mag]
    If the druid dies, except if by old age, she may choose to have your body and soul become an instrument of nature's will.
    Your body immediately decomposes or otherwise disappears, and your soul does not travel to an afterlife.
    She has no physical form, and cannot use any of your normal abilities.
    Instead, you ha a fly speed of 100 feet, with special maneuverability.
    As a standard action, she can temporarily possess any living plants or animals within a 10 mile radius of the place of your death.

    While possessing a living plant or animal, she can see through its senses and control its actions completely.
    In addition, she may cast spells, and the spells take effect as if the plant or animal had cast them.
    She uses the plant or animal's position to determine range, visible targets, and so on.
    She does not require verbal or somatic components to cast your spells in this form, but is unable to cast spells or perform rituals that require material components or focus objects.

    While not possessing a plant or animal, the druid can rest, or she can focus on reincarnating your physical form.
    Creating a new body in this way takes 12 straight hours of concentration.
    At the end of that time, you are reincarnated in a new body in your location, as the effect of the \spell{reincarnate} ritual, except that she can choose your race from among the races listed (not including the ``Other'' race).

    While you i an avatar of nature, a druid does not age and does not die of old age.
    She can continue to exist in this form indefinitely.

    \subsection{Ex-Druids}
        A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and magical druid class abilities.
        She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until you atone (see the \spell{atonement} ritual).

    \subsection{Variant Druids}

        \subsubsection{Blighter}

            Blighters draw power from nature, as do other druids. However, while other druids revere nature and draw power from it gently, blighters steal power from nature forcefully. Wherever a blighter goes, destruction and death surely follows.

            \altcf{Blight} Instead of meditating to regain spell slots, a blighter draws power from your environment forcefully.
            This affects a \areahuge radius zone centered on your, and the process takes 1 minute of concentration.
            At the end of every round, every living thing in the area other than the blighter takes damage equal to your nature power.
            All inanimate plants of Huge size or smaller immediately wither and die.
            The earth becomes cracked and infertile, and any nutrients from the soil are destroyed.
            This ability has no effect on artificial environments or materials, such as metal or worked stone.
            At the end of the minute, the blighter regains your spent nature spell slots.

            A blighter can only blight your surroundings in this way once per hour.
            If your surroundings are already blighted or are not natural terrain, she cannot use this ability to regain your spells.
            Instead, she must meditate for 8 hours to slowly draw power from your surroundings, as a normal druid.

            \altcf{Spells} As normal, except that a blighter adds all Vivimancy arcane spells to your spell list.

            \altcf[2nd]{Wild Speech} As normal, except that a blighter gains a \plus5 bonus to Intimidate against your wild speech targets, and a \minus5 penalty to Persuasion.

            \altcf[10th]{Blightcasting}

            \altcf[20th]{Improved Blightcasting}

        \subsubsection{Rotbringer}

            While most druids seek to emulate and interact with animals, rotbringers focus on the power of fungi, decay, and regeneration.

            \altcf{Invoke Rot} Instead of meditating to regain spell slots, a rotbringer accelerates the natural forces of decomposition and decay on your environment.
            This affects a \areahuge radius zone centered on your, and the process takes 1 minute of concentration.
            All organic objects of Huge size or smaller, such as plants and corpses, decompose.
            This decomposition kills inanimate, living plants.
            All organic objects, regardless of size, are covered with various fungi.
            This ability has no effect on artificial environments or materials, such as metal or worked stone.
            At the end of the minute, the rotbringer regains your spent nature spell slots.

            If the rotbringer decomposes a Huge object with this ability, or a combination of smaller objects equivalent in size to a Huge object, you gain an bonus nature spell slot of your highest available spell level.
            This extra spell slot lasts until it is used, or until you regain your spell slots again.

            A rotbringer can only invoke rot on your surroundings in this way once per hour.
            If your surroundings are already decomposed or are not natural terrain, she cannot use this ability to regain your spells.
            Instead, she must meditate for 8 hours to slowly draw power from your surroundings, as a normal druid.

            \altcf[2nd]{Wild Speech} The rotbringer gains the ability to speak with plants at 2nd level.
            She gains the ability to speak with animals at 6th level, instead of at 2nd level.

            \altcf[3rd]{Wild Aspect} The rotbringer does not gain this ability.

            \altcf[3rd]{Rot Spell} The druid learns an additional spell slot and spell known.
            The spell must be taken from the following list of spells.
            The spell's level cannot exceed half your druid level.
            If she already knows a spell from the list at every spell level you ha access to, she may instead learn any nature spell (see \pcref{Nature Spells}).

            At 5th level, and every odd level, the druid may learn a new spell.

            \end{dtable}

            \altcf[7th]{Fungal Armor} The rotbringer becomes covered in fungus that protects your from attacks. She gains a \plus1 bonus to Armor and Fortitude defense.

            This bonus increases by 1 at your 7th druid level, and every 4 druid levels thereafter.

        \cf{Ftr}{Martial Excellence}
        A fighter gains a \plus1 bonus to accuracy and damage with physical attacks.
        In addition, he gains a \plus1 bonus to physical defenses.

    \subsection{Class Abilities}
        All fighters have the following abilities.

        \cf{Ftr}{Combat Supremacy}
        A fighter is a consummate warrior, and can stand toe to toe with even the toughest foes.
        Whenever the fighter deals damage to a creature with a physical attack, he may impede its fighting ability as an \glossterm{immediate action}.
        If he does, the struck creature is \impaired on attacks and checks against the fighter for 2 rounds, or until he uses this ability on that creature again.
        He may use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Intelligence or your fighter level, whichever is higher.

        \cf{Ftr}[2nd]{Weapon Discipline}
        The fighter's training grants you additional capability when using your weapons.
        He may choose a weapon group, or he may choose to train equally with all weapons.
        If he chooses a weapon group, he gains a \plus1 bonus to damage on attacks with weapons from that group.

        If he chooses not to focus on a specific group of weapons, he gains the ability to become proficient with any weapon group if he spends 1 hour training with a weapon from that group.
        He may only keep this proficiency with one weapon group at a time; if he trains with a new weapon group, you lose your proficiency in the previous group.

        \cf{Ftr}[3rd]{Combat Feat}
        The fighter gets a bonus Combat feat (see \pcref{Combat Feats}).
        He must use your fighter level in place of your character level to meet level prerequisites for the feat.
        He gains an additional bonus feat at your 7th fighter level and every four fighter levels thereafter.

        \cf{Ftr}[4th]{Combat Discipline}
        The fighter can use your superior training and focus to keep fighting in the face of debilitating effects.
        When a fighter is initially affected by one of the conditions listed on \trefnp{Combat Discipline Conditions}, he may use your combat discipline ability to instead suffer the mitigated condition one column to the right.
        He can suppress the condition up to 5 rounds.

        \par Using combat discipline takes no action, and can be done at any time, even when it isn't the fighter's turn.
        A fighter may use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Willpower or half your fighter level, whichever is higher.
        However, he cannot mitigate more than one condition at a time.
        If the fighter attempts to mitigate a new condition, the old condition resumes its normal effect immediately.

        \end{dtable}

        \par A fighter can never use this ability more than once against a single source.
        For example, if a fighter is confused by a \spell{confusion} spell, he can use this ability to become disoriented instead of confused, but he can't then expend a second use to stop being disoriented.
        The lesser condition that this ability imposes may be cured or removed normally, but doing so does not affect the resurgence of the condition the fighter was originally afflicted with.
        If a fighter uses this ability to mitigate or negate a condition which he must suffer as a sacrifice or cost to gain some benefit, he automatically forfeits the benefit he would have gained.

        \cf{Ftr}[5th]{Battlemaster}
        The fighter becomes a master of controlling the ebb and flow of battle.
        When he use your combat supremacy ability, he may choose for the struck creature to be \goaded by you or \shaken by you instead of impaired.

        \cf{Ftr}[6th]{Armor Discipline}
        The fighter's training grants you additional capability in armor.
        He must choose to improve your agility or your resilience in armor.
        This applies to all armor discipline abilities the fighter has.

        If you improve your agility, he treats body armor he wears as less encumbering.
        He reduces its \glossterm{encumbrance penalty} by 2 its arcane spell failure by 10\%.
        In addition, he treats it were one encumbrance category lighter than it is whenever doing so would be beneficial for you.
        Heavy armor is treated as medium armor, medium armor is treated as light armor, and light armor is treated as being unarmored.
        This can remove the speed reduction and reduced Dexterity associated with the armor's encumbrance, as appropriate for the new encumbrance of the fighter's armor.

        If you improve your resilience, he gains damage reduction against physical damage equal to your character level. This allows you to ignore the first points of damage he would take each round.

        \cf{Ftr}[8th]{Improved Weapon Discipline}
        The fighter's training in your chosen weapons improves.
        He increases the \glossterm{critical multiplier} of your chosen weapons by 1.
        In addition, if he chose a specific weapon group, you increase your damage bonus to \plus2.
        If he did not, he becomes proficient with all weapon groups and all exotic weapons.
        He retains this benefit for one week after the training.

        \cf{Ftr}[9th]{Combat Mastery}
        The fighter may use your combat supremacy ability any number of times per day.

        \cf{Ftr}[10th]{Improved Combat Discipline}
        The fighter's ability to keep fighting despite negative influence improves.
        He can reduce conditions by two steps instead of one when using combat discipline.
        For example, a stunned fighter who used combat discipline would instead be staggered.
        \par In addition, a fighter may use combat discipline to reduce any penalties he suffers to your accuracy, damage, checks, or defenses by 2, even if the source of the penalty is not listed on the combat discipline chart.
        \par The fighter may also mitigate up to two conditions at once.

        \cf{Ftr}[12th]{Improved Armor Discipline}
        The fighter's training with your armor improves.
        If he chose agility, he treats body armor he wears as even less encumbering.
        He reduces its \glossterm{encumbrance penalty} by 4 and decreases its arcane spell failure by 20\%.
        In addition, he treats all it as if it were two encumbrance categories lighter than it is whenever doing so is beneficial for you.
        This does not stack with the benefit of the armor discipline ability.

        If he chose resilience, he may apply your damage reduction from the armor discipline ability against all damage, including from magical attacks.
        In addition, he gains a \plus1 bonus to Armor defense while wearing armor.

        \cf{Ftr}[13th]{Swift Warrior}
        The fighter can take an additional \glossterm{swift action} or \glossterm{immediate action} each round (see \pcref{Swift and Immediate Actions}).

        \cf{Ftr}[14th]{Greater Weapon Discipline}
        The fighter's training in your chosen weapons becomes still greater.
        He increases the \glossterm{critical range} of your chosen weapons by 1.
        This increase stacks with any other effects that affect critical range.
        For example, a fighter using heavy blades with the Weapon Focus feat (see \featpcref{Weapon Focus}) would have a critical range of 18-20.

        \cf{Ftr}[16th]{Greater Combat Discipline}
        The fighter's ability to keep fighting despite influence becomes still greater.
        When using combat discipline, he may ignore any condition listed on the combat discipline chart.
        In addition, he may use combat discipline to be \severelyimpaired with attacks and checks rather than suffer any non-damaging condition not listed on the chart.

        \par The fighter may also mitigate up to three conditions at once.

        \cf{Ftr}[17th]{Supreme Battlemaster}
        The fighter's ability to control the battle improves.
        Whenever you use your combat supremacy ability, he may choose for the struck creature to be \taunted or \frightened instead of impaired.

        \cf{Ftr}[18th]{Greater Armor Discipline}
        The fighter's training in your chosen armor becomes still greater.
        If he chose agility, he ignores all encumbrance penalties and arcane spell failure from body armor he wears.
        In addition, he treats body armor he wears as if it were three encumbrance categories lighter than it actually is whenever doing so would be beneficial to you.
        This does not stack with the benefits of armor discipline or improved armor discipline.
        In addition, he gains a \plus4 bonus to Reflex defense.

        If he chose resilience, he gains a \plus4 bonus to Fortitude defense.

        \cf{Ftr}[20th]{Supreme Discipline}
        The fighter's discipline in your chosen area is beyond equal.
        He must choose either weapon discipline, armor discipline, or combat discipline.
        Depending on which discipline he chooses, he gains a different bonus.
        \subcf{Supreme Weapon Discipline}
        Whenever the fighter deals damage to a creature with a physical attack, the struck creature is \severelyimpaired with attacks and checks for 2 rounds.
        \subcf{Supreme Armor Discipline}
        If the fighter chose agility, he gains a \plus2 bonus to physical defenses.

        If the fighter chose resilience, he doubles the damage reduction granted by your armor discipline ability.
        \subcf{Supreme Combat Discipline}
        The fighter can use combat discipline to be \impaired with attacks and checks instead of suffering any nondamaging negative effect with a duration.
        He may also mitigate up to four conditions at once.

    \subparhead{Other} Bluff, Intimidate, Persuasion.

    \subsection{Base Class Abilities}
        A character with mage as a base class gains the following abilities.

        \classbasics{Skill Points} 5.

        \classbasics{Defenses} \plus4 Mental.

        \classbasics{Action Points} \plus3.

        \cf{Mge}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
        Mages are proficient with simple weapons and one other weapon group.
        They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield.
        Armor of any type interferes with a mage's arcane gestures, which can cause your spells with somatic components to fail.

        \cf{Mge}{Spell Point}
        The mage gains a spell point.
        A spell point can be spent to cast spells in place of an action point.
        She recovers all spent spell points after a \glossterm{short rest}.

    \subsection{Class Abilities}
        All mages have the following abilities.

        \cf{Mge}{Arcane Essence}
        All mages have access to great arcane power.
        However, not all mages acquired this power in the same way.
        A mage must choose an arcane essence.
        The mage's arcane essence affects several aspects of your class abilities.
        \parhead{Sorcerer} Sorcerers have an intuitive connection to magic that allows them to cast spells without preparation or training.
        \parhead{Wizard} Wizards studied arcane mysteries for years to learn the secret ways of magic.
        A wizard casts spells with your Intelligence.

        \cf{Mge}{Spells}
        A mage casts arcane spells.
        \textit{Sorcerer} --- A sorcerer's spellpower is equal to your character level or your Willpower, whichever is higher.
        The maximum spell level she can cast is equal to half your mage level (minimum 1).
        \textit{Wizard} --- A wizard's spellpower is equal to your character level or your Intelligence, whichever is higher.
        The maximum spell level she can cast is equal to half your mage level (minimum 1) or your Intelligence, whichever is lower.

        To cast a spell, a mage must spend an \glossterm{action point}.
        Every spell can also be cast as a cantrip.
        Cantrips are weaker, but do not require action points to cast.

        A 1st-level mage knows three spells.
        Every even level, you learn an additional spell.
        In addition, each time you gain a level, she may trade one of your existing spells for a different spell known.
        A mage's spells are drawn from the spells on the arcane spell list (see \pcref{Arcane Spells}).

        Almost all mages know at least one cantrip.
        Cantrips are special spells that do not require action points to cast.
        They are decribed first on the list of arcane spells (see \pcref{Cantrip List}).

        \cf{Mge}{Rituals}
        \subparhead{Sorcerer} Sorcerers cannot perform arcane rituals.
        \subparhead{Wizard} Wizards can perform arcane rituals to create unique magical effects (see \pcref{Rituals}).
        A wizard begins play with a ritual book containing two arcane rituals of your choice (see \pcref{Arcane Rituals}).

        \cf{Mge}[2nd]{Arcane Defense}[Mag]
        The mage gains a \plus2 bonus to defenses against spells.

        \cf{Mge}[3rd]{Arcane Insight}\label{Arcane Insight}
        The mage gains a greater understanding of magic.
        She chooses one of the following insights.
        Each insight can be chosen multiple times.
        Unless otherwise noted, their effects stack.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Innate Spell: The mage chooses a spell you know as an innate spell.
                She no longer needs verbal or somatic components to cast the spell.
                \par If you choose this insight multiple times, she must choose a different spell each time.
            \item Personal Spell: The mage chooses a spell you know as a personal spell.
                She cannot miscast the spell (see \pcref{Miscasting}).
                If she would miscast it, the spell simply fails without effect.
                In addition, she automatically succeeds at all Concentration checks you make to cast the spell.
                \par If the mage chooses this insight multiple times, she must choose a different spell each time.
            \item Specialization: The mage chooses a school of magic.
                She gains an additional spell known that can only be used to learn a spell from that school.
                In exchange, she must ban a school of magic.
                She can never learn or cast spells or rituals from your banned schools.
                If you know spells from a banned school, she must immediately learn different spells from unbanned schools in their place.
                Divination cannot be chosen as a banned school.
                \par If the mage chooses this insight multiple times, she must choose to specialize in the same school each time.
        \end{itemize}

        \subparhead{Sorcerer} A sorcerer may also choose the Expanded Spell Knowledge insight.
        She chooses a single spell from the divine spell list or nature spell list and adds it to your arcane spell list.
        This does not grant your the spell as a spell known.
        \par If you choose this insight multiple times, she must choose a different spell each time.

        \subparhead{Wizard} A wizard may also choose the Ritual Spell insight.
        She scribes an arcane spell into your ritual book.
        She does not need to know the spell, and pays no cost to scribe it.
        The spell is treated as a ritual, and she can perform a one minute ritual to gain the spell's effect.
        Performing the ritual costs the normal amount of material components for a ritual of its level (see \pcref{Ritual Costs}).

        \cf{Mge}[4th]{Arcane Essence}[Mag]
        The mage gains an ability based on your choice of arcane essence.
        \subparhead{Sorcerer} The sorcerer gains bonus hit points equal to your sorcerer level or Willpower, whichever is higher.
        \subparhead{Wizard} The wizard gains a \plus2 bonus to all Knowledge skills.

        \cf{Mge}[6th]{Inherent Magic}[Mag]
        The mage becomes inherently magical.
        She may choose an arcane spell with a maximum level equal to half your mage level \sub 2.
        The spell must be a \glossterm{targeted spell} and have a duration of \durshort or longer.
        She does not need to know the spell.
        The mage constantly gains the benefits of that spell.
        If the spell has secondary effects, such as the \spell{avatar of suffering} spell, the duration of the secondary effects is not changed.

        When the mage chooses a spell in this way, the mage may also choose specific augments for that spell, as long as the spell's effective level does not exceed half your character level.
        If the spell's effect ends for any reason, such as if its effect is discharged, it takes effect on the mage again 5 minutes later.

        At your 10th mage level, and every 4 mage levels thereafter, the mage may choose an additional attuned spell.

        \cf{Mge}[8th]{Arcane Essence}[Mag]
        The mage gains an ability based on your choice of arcane essence.
        \subparhead{Sorcerer} The sorcerer gains \glossterm{magic resistance} equal to 10 \add your character level or Willpower, whichever is higher.
        This ability does not protect the sorcerer from your own miscast effects.
        If she already has magic resistance from another source, you increase that magic resistance by 2.
        \subparhead{Wizard} As a standard action, the wizard can spend an action point to begin casting two spells at once.
        She must designate one as the primary spell and the other as the secondary spell.
        The level of both spells, including any augments, must not exceed half your mage level.
        If the two spells are different levels, she must designate the higher level spell to be the primary spell.

        When you finishe casting, you choose which one of those spells takes effect.
        She spends an action point if necessary to cast the spell, and its effect takes place.
        The second spell dissipates without spending an action point or having any effect.

        If the wizard's concentration is disrupted, the primary spell is miscast.
        If she must spend an action point to cast that spell, you spend it.
        However, the secondary spell dissipates without spending an action point or having any effect.

        \cf{Mge}[12th]{Arcane Essence}[Mag]
        The mage gains an ability based on your choice of arcane essence.
        \subparhead{Sorcerer} The sorcerer gains a spell point.
        A spell point can be spent to cast spells in place of an action point.
        She recovers all spent spell points after a \glossterm{short rest}.
        \subparhead{Wizard} The wizard gains the ability to prepare a spell so it takes effect automatically if specific circumstances arise.
        To prepare a contingency, the wizard must spend 5 minutes preparing the spell.
        A contingency spell is treated as being two levels higher than its actual level for the purpose of determining whether the wizard can cast the spell.
        During this casting time, the wizard specifies what circumstances cause the spell to take effect.

        The contingency can be set to trigger in response to any circumstances that a typical human observing the wizard and your situation could detect.
        For example, a wizard could specify ``when I fall at least 50 feet'' or ``when I become bloodied'', but not ``when there is an invisible creature within 50 feet of me'' or ``when I am at 17 hit points or fewer.'' The more specific the required circumstances, the better -- vague requirements, such as ``when I am in danger'', may cause the contingency to trigger unexpectedly or fail to trigger at all.
        If a wizard attempts to specify multiple separate triggering conditions, such as ``when I take damage or when an enemy is adjacent to me'', the contingency will randomly ignore all but one of the conditions.

        The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less.
        The contingency can specify a simple rule for identifying how to target the spell, such as ``the closest enemy''.
        If the rule is poorly worded or imprecise, the contingency may target incorrectly or fail to activate at all.
        Any spells which require decisions, such as the \spell{dimension door} spell, must have those decisions made at the time the contingency is created.
        The wizard cannot change those decisions when the contingency takes effect.

        A wizard can have only one contingency active at a time.
        If you create another contingency, it replaces your old contingency.

        \cf{Mge}[16th]{Arcane Essence}[Mag]
        The mage gains an ability based on your choice of arcane essence.
        \subparhead{Sorcerer} Whenever the sorcerer resists a spell with your magic resistance, you gain the ability to cast that spell once during the next 5 rounds.
        The spell retains all augments, effects from feats and other abilities, and similar modifications from the original caster, and the sorcerer cannot choose any other augments or apply effects from your own abilities.
        However, you make all other decisions required to cast the spell, and uses your spellpower to determine the spell's effects.
        Once you cast the spell, you expend the absorbed energy, can cannot cast it again.

        \subparhead{Wizard} The wizard may ready two spells in your contingency instead of a single spell.
        In addition, she may have two contingencies active at once instead of one.
        Only one contingency can trigger in a given round.
        If both would trigger, only the first contingency cast triggers, and the second does not.

        \cf{Mge}[20th]{Archmage}
        The mage no longer needs to spend action points to cast spells.
        If you ha any spell points, you lose those spell points and gains the same number of legend points.

        \classbasics{Action Points} \plus3.

        \cf{Mnk}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
        Monks are proficient with simple weapons, monk weapons, and any one other weapon group.
        Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields.
        When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses the benefit of your enlightened defense, fast movement, and \ki abilities.

        \cf{Mnk}{Ki Strike}[Mag] A monk's fists, and all weapons you use, gain a \plus1 \glossterm{enhancement bonus}.
        This functions like an enhancement bonus on a weapon, increasing your damage and offensive legend points per day (see \pcref{Weapon Enhancement Bonuses}).
        In addition, you i always treated as if you wa wearing \plus1 armor, granting your temporary hit points and defensive legend points (see \pcref{Armor Enhancement Bonuses}).
        This bonus increases by \plus1 at 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter.

    \subsection{Class Abilities}
        All monks have the following abilities.

        \cf{Mnk}{Enlightened Defense}[Mag]
        A monk's \ki shields your body from attacks.
        When \monkunencumbered, you gain a \plus2 bonus to Armor defense.
        She loses this bonus when you i helpless.

        \cf{Mnk}{Ki Power}
        Many monk abilities depend on your \ki power.
        A monk's \ki power is equal to your Willpower or your character level, whichever is higher.

        \cf{Mnk}{Unarmed Warrior}
        A monk's unarmed attacks are exceptionally deadly.
        She gains Unarmed Fighting as a bonus feat, making your proficient with your unarmed attack (see \featpcref{Unarmed Fighting}).
        In addition, you increase the damage of your unarmed attacks by two increments (see \pcref{Weapon Size}).
        For example, a Medium monk would deal 1d6 damage with your unarmed attack.
        For details about how to fight while unarmed, see \pcref{Unarmed Combat}.

        \cf{Mnk}[2nd]{Manifest Ki}[Mag]
        The monk gains the ability to channel your \ki energy to temporarily enhance your abilities.
        She chooses one \ki manifestation from the list below.

        Using a \ki manifestation costs a \ki point.
        The monk has a number of \ki points equal to your Willpower or your monk level, whichever is higher.
        \Ki points can be recovered by meditation.
        If the monk meditates for 1 hour, you recover all spent \ki points.

        Some \ki manifestations have minimum monk levels, as indicated in the title of the power.
        At your 4th monk level, and every even monk level thereafter, the monk learns an additional \ki manifestation.

        Some \ki manifestations have the effects of spells.
        Unless otherwise noted, the monk's effective spellpower with these abilities is equal to your \ki power.

        The reformed body is in perfect health and can be any age the monk chooses, to a minimum of the age of adulthood for your race.
        She can reform your body at the place where she died, or in any place on the same plane that is deeply familiar to your.

        The paladin may use your discernment ability a number of times per day equal to your Perception or half your paladin level (minimum 1), whichever is higher.

        At 7th level, the paladin can discern lies.
        Whenever a creature in the area intentionally lies, the paladin knows the statement was a lie.

        Enemies in the area are \impaired with attacks and checks.
        \subcf{12th -- Painful Aura}

        Any damage in excess of the creature's hit points is not redirected.

        \parhead{Good Divine Presences}
        \subcf{Defensive Aura}
        Allies in the area that are \glossterm{overwhelmed} reduce their overwhelm penalties by 1.
        If an ally's overwhelm penalty is reduced to 0, they are not considered to be overwhelmed.
        \subcf{8th -- Minor Healing Aura}
        Whenever an ally in the area regains hit points, the healing is doubled, up to a maximum bonus equal to the paladin's divine power.
        Each ally can only receive this bonus once per round.
        \subcf{12th -- Healing Aura}
        At the end of each round, allies in the area heal hit points equal to the paladin's divine power.
        \subcf{16th -- Martyr's Aura}
        Whenever an ally in the area takes damage, the paladin may choose to take that damage instead.
        This damage ignores all forms of damage reduction and similar abilities.
        If the paladin takes damage in excess of your hit points in this way, the excess damage is dealt directly as vital damage.

        \parhead{Lawful Divine Presences}
        \subcf{Aura of Fortification}
        Enemies in the area move at half speed through threatened squares.
        \subcf{8th -- Aura of Inhibition}
        Enemies in the area move at half speed.
        \subcf{12th -- Aura of Truth}
        All illusory figments and glamers are suppressed in the area.
        \subcf{20th -- Inescapable Aura}
        At the start of each round, enemies in the area are \immobilized that round.

        \cf{Pal}[5th]{Pass Judgment}[Mag]
        The paladin gains the ability to pass judgment on those you deem unworthy.
        Once per day as a swift action, she may pass judgment on a creature within 100 feet of your.
        For the purpose of spells and effects, the creature is treated as if it had the alignment opposed to the paladin's devoted alignment.
        This effect lasts for one week, or until the paladin changes your mind about the subject.
        This does not change the creature's actions or behavior, but the creature is subject to the paladin's smite attack, would detect as that alignment under the inspection of a \spell{detect alignment} spell, and so on.

        No attack is required for this effect, and it cannot be dispelled, but a \spell{remove curse}, \spell{miracle}, or \spell{wish} spell can remove it.
        The paladin can use this ability an additional time per day at your 9th paladin level and every four levels thereafter.
        A paladin should be careful when using this ability, as persecution of allies can lead overzealous paladins to fall.

        \cf{Pal}[9th]{Expanded Presence}[Mag]
        The paladin's divine presences affect an \arealarge radius.

        \cf{Pal}[13th]{Lingering Presence}[Mag]
        The effects of the paladin's divine presences continue for 1 round after targets leave the area.

        \cf{Pal}[15th]{Martyr's Retribution}[Mag]
        If the paladin dies in the devoted service of your devoted alignment, she may choose to have your fallen body erupt in an immense burst of divine energy.
        If you doe, your body is almost completely consumed, preventing your from being raised with \ritual{resurrection} and similar effects that require an intact body.
        This burst has two effects.
        First, a \spell{sunburst} spell immediately takes effect over the area where the paladin fell.
        Second, a \spell{storm of vengeance} spell begins to take effect, centered on the same area.
        The spell lasts for 10 rounds, and the lightning strikes target the paladin's enemies.
        Both of these effects harm only the paladin's foes, and do not harm your allies.
        However, your allies' vision is still impeded by the \spell{storm of vengeance}.

        \cf{Pal}[17th]{Mighty Presence}[Mag]
        The paladin's divine presences affect an \areahuge radius.
        In addition, their effects continue for 2 rounds after targets leave the area.

        \cf{Pal}[20th]{Aligned Soul}[Mag]
        While a paladin is dead, she may approach the deity or governing figure of your afterlife and request to be returned to life to continue your mission.
        Travelling to the relevant figure and making the request takes 12 hours.
        Unless there are extenuating circumstances, this request is almost always granted, and you are resurrected in a new body at a location of the entity's choice.
        This functions like the \spell{resurrection} ritual, except that no part of the body is required, and a new body is created by the entity.
        She can be resurrected in this way regardless of the condition of your body, but not if your soul has been trapped or otherwise prevented from going to the correct afterlife.

        \subsubsection{Ex-Paladins}
            A paladin who ceases to follow your devoted alignment loses all magical paladin class abilities.
            She may not gain any additional paladin levels.
            She regains your abilities and advancement potential if you atone for your violations (see the \spell{atonement} ritual), as appropriate.

    \subsection{Base Class Abilities}
        A character with ranger as a base class gains the following abilities.

        \classbasics{Skill Points} 15.

        \classbasics{Defenses} \plus4 Fortitude, \plus4 Reflex, \plus2 Mental.

        \classbasics{Action Points} \plus1.

        \cf{Rgr}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
        A ranger is proficient with simple weapons, any two weapon groups, light and medium armor, and shields.
        He is also proficient with your choice of bows, crossbows, or thrown weapons.

        \cf{Rgr}{Tenacious Hunter}
        The ranger adds your quarry bonus to your defenses against attacks that your quarry makes.
        See the Quarry ability, below, for details.

        \cf{Rgr}{Wild Speech}[Mag]
        The ranger learns how to communicate with animals.
        This ability functions like the druid ability of the same name (see Wild Speech, \pref{Drd:Wild Speech}).
        A ranger can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Perception or half your ranger level, whichever is higher.

    \subsection{Class Abilities}
        All rangers have the following abilities.

        \cf{Rgr}{Quarry}
        As a swift action, a ranger may designate any foe he sees as your quarry.
        A ranger gains a \plus2 bonus to damage with physical attacks and Awareness, Stealth, and Survival checks against your quarry.
        However, while a ranger has designated a quarry, he takes a \minus2 penalty on the same rolls against any target other than your quarry.

        A ranger may not normally have more than one quarry at once.
        He may not designate a new quarry until you defeat your old quarry, or until he gives up on the quarry.
        He may give up pursuing a quarry as a free action.
        If he does, he is unable to designate a new quarry until he rests for 5 minutes.

        Some abilities allow the ranger to designate multiple creatures as a quarry.
        Abilities which designate multiple creatures as a quarry always last for a specific amount of time.

        If the ranger does not see your quarry for more than a week, it is no longer considered your quarry.

        The amount by which a ranger's damage and skill checks increase against your quarry is called your quarry bonus.
        The ranger's quarry bonus improves by \plus1 at your 5th ranger level and every 5 ranger levels thereafter.
        Your penalties against targets other than your quarry remains the same.

        \cf{Rgr}[2nd]{Hunting Skill}
        The ranger gains any Skill feat with prerequisites that include one of the ranger class skills as a bonus feat.
        He must use your ranger level in place of your character level to meet level prerequisites for the feat.
        At your 6th ranger level, and every 4 ranger levels thereafter, he gains an additional feat.

        \cf{Rgr}[2nd]{Tracker}
        The ranger gains a \plus5 bonus to checks made to follow tracks.
        In addition, he may use your ranger level in place of the Survival skill to follow tracks (see \pcref{Survival}).

        \cf{Rgr}[4th]{Hunting Lore}
        The ranger gains an ability drawn from ancient hunting lore.
        He chooses a single hunting lore from the list below.
        Some hunting lores have minimum ranger levels, as indicated in the title of the ability.
        At your 8th ranger level, and every four ranger levels thereafter, the ranger gains an additional hunting lore.

        If a hunting lore grants the ranger a bonus feat, he must still meet any prerequisites for the feat to gain its effect.

        \subcf{Dual Quarry}
        The ranger may designate up to two targets whenever he chooses a quarry.
        He gains your quarry benefits against both targets.
        Whenever he designates new quarries, he may choose which previous quarry to give up (if any).

        \subcf{Endurance}
        The ranger gains the Endurance feat as a bonus feat (see \featpcref{Endurance}).

        \subcf{Goading Hunter}
        Whenever the ranger damages your quarry with a physical attack, it is \goaded by you for 2 rounds.

        \subcf{No Escape}
        Whenever the ranger damages your quarry with a physical attack, it moves at half speed for 2 rounds.

        \subcf{Swift Hunter}
        The ranger gains the Swift feat as a bonus feat (see \featpcref{Swift}).

        \subcf{8th -- Anchored Quarry}
        Whenever the ranger damages your quarry with a physical attack, it cannot travel extradimensionally for 2 rounds.
        This blocks teleportation and all planar travel abilities except planar rifts.

        \subcf{8th -- Flexible Quarry}
        After giving up on a quarry, the ranger does not need to wait before designating a new quarry.

        \subcf{8th -- Impaired Quarry}
        Whenever the ranger damages your quarry with a physical attack, it is \impaired with attacks and checks for 2 rounds.

        \subcf{12th -- Inescapable}
        Whenever the ranger damages your quarry with a physical attack, it moves at one-quarter speed as long as it remains your quarry.

        \subcf{12th -- Inevitable Hunter}
        The ranger ignores all miss chances and failure chances that would affect attacks and checks he makes against your quarry.

        \subcf{12th -- Punishing Presence}
        At the end of each round, if the ranger's quarry is within \rnglong range of you, it takes life damage equal to your ranger level.

        \subcf{16th -- Legendary Hunter}
        The ranger may always use legend points on attacks or checks he makes against your quarry, even when fighting monsters that normally prevent legend points from being used.

        \subcf{16th -- Master of the Hunt}
        When the ranger uses your quarry ability, he may also designate up to five willing creatures within \rnglong range of you.
        As long as they stay within \rnglong range of you, they also gain the damage bonus from the ranger's quarry ability against your quarry.
        Your allies do not suffer penalties against targets other than the quarry.

        \cf{Rgr}[3rd]{Free Stride}
        The ranger can move through any sort of natural terrain that slows or impedes movement at your normal speed without suffering any sort of impairment.
        If a skill check, such as Climb or Swim, would normally be required to move through the terrain, this ability does not help.

        \cf{Rgr}[3rd]{Keen Vision}
        The ranger's sight improves, allowing you to see more easily.
        He gains \glossterm{low-light vision}, allowing you to treat sources of light as if they had double their normal illumination range.
        If he already has low-light vision, he doubles its benefit, allowing you to treat sources of light as if they had four times their normal illumination range.
        In addition, he gains \glossterm{darkvision} out to 50 feet, allowing you to see in complete darkness.
        If he already has darkvision, he increases its range by 50 feet.

        \cf{Rgr}[5th]{Rapid Tracker}
        The ranger's ability to track your foes improves.
        He can move at your normal speed while following tracks without taking the normal \minus5 penalty.
        He takes only a \minus10 penalty (instead of the normal \minus20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.

        \cf{Rgr}[7th]{Blindsense}
        The ranger's perceptions are so finely honed that he can sense your enemies without seeing them.
        He gains the blindsense ability out to 50 feet.
        This ability allows you to sense the presence and location of objects and foes within 50 feet without seeing them.
        If he already has the blindsense ability, he increases its range by 50 feet.

        In addition, he increases the range of your darkvision by 150 feet.

        \cf{Rgr}[9th]{Perfect Stride}[Mag]
        The ranger's ability to surpass obstacles becomes unparalleled.
        He constantly acts as if he were under the effect of a \spell{freedom} spell, except that it does not allow you to act normally underwater.

        \cf{Rgr}[11th]{Blindsight}
        The ranger gains the \glossterm{blindsight} ability, allowing you to ``see'' perfectly without your eyes in a 50 foot radius around you.
        With this ability, he can fight just as well with your eyes closed as with them open.
        If he already has the blindsight ability, he increases its range by 50 feet.

        In addition, he increases the range of your darkvision by 300 feet, and your blindsense by 150 feet.

        \cf{Rgr}[13th]{Implacable Hunter}[Mag]
        The ranger cannot be blocked from pursuing your quarry.
        Your movement is not slowed by enemies threatening you (see \pcref{Moving Near Foes}).
        In addition, he may move at half speed through spaces occupied by foes.

        \cf{Rgr}[15th]{Farsight}
        The ranger increases the range of your darkvision by 500 feet, your blindsense by 300 feet, and your blindsight by 50 feet.
        In addition, you halve your \glossterm{range increment penalties} for attacking at long range.

        \cf{Rgr}[17th]{Eternal Quarry}
        The ranger's quarry never stops being your quarry until he chooses a different creature.
        In addition, once he has designated a creature as a quarry, he can always designate it as a quarry again, even if it is not in your sight.
        This only applies to creatures that he designates as a quarry after acquiring this ability.

        \cf{Rgr}[19th]{Truesight}[Mag]
        The ranger's perceptions are accurate enough to defeat even powerful magic.
        He can see through normal and magical darkness, see the truth behind visual figments and glamers, and see the true form of creatures and objects affected by \glossterm{Shaping} abilities.
        This ability works at any range.

    \subsection{Base Class Abilities}
        A character with rogue as a base class gains the following abilities.

        \classbasics{Defenses} \plus4 Reflex, \plus2 Mental.

        \classbasics{Action Points} \plus2.

        \cf{Rog}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
        Rogues are proficient with simple weapons, any two weapon groups, light armor, and bucklers.
        They are also proficient with saps.

        \cf{Rog}{Skill Exemplar}
        A rogue gains a \plus2 bonus to all skills you i trained in.
        This bonus increases by 1 at your 5th rogue level and every 5 rogue levels thereafter.

    \subsection{Class Abilities}
        All rogues have the following abilities.

        \cf{Rog}{Sneak Attack}
        Once per round, when a rogue hits with a physical attack against a creature unable to defend itself effectively, she can make that attack a sneak attack.
        She can make a sneak attack if your target is \unaware, \defenseless, or suffering \glossterm{overwhelm penalties} from being surrounded by enemies (see \pcref{Overwhelm}).
        A sneak attack deals 1d6 points of bonus damage.

        The extra damage dealt by a sneak attack increases by 1d6 at your 3rd rogue level and every two rogue levels thereafter.

        Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.
        A rogue can't strike with deadly accuracy from beyond that range.

        A rogue can only sneak attack creatures with a discernible body structure.
        Oozes, incorporeal creatures, and some plants lack vital areas to attack.
        Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks.
        The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot.
        A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach.
        Usually, this means she can only make sneak attacks against creatures no more than two size categories larger than your.

        \cf{Rog}[2nd]{Skill Talent}
        The rogue's skills improve.
        She gains an additional skill point, which she can place in any skill, and a bonus Skill feat for which you qualifie (see \pcref{Skill Feats}).
        She must use your rogue level in place of your character level to meet level prerequisites for the feat.
        At your 6th rogue level, and every four rogue levels thereafter, you gain an additional skill point and Skill feat.

        \cf{Rog}[3rd]{Uncanny Dodge}
        The rogue can react to danger before your senses would normally allow your to do so.
        The rogue reduces your overwhelm penalties by 1.
        If your overwhelm penalty is reduced to 0, you i not considered to be overwhelmed.
        In addition, you i not \unaware when attacked by surprise.

        \subcf{12th -- Assassination}
        To use this ability, the rogue must spend a full round studying a creature within 100 feet of your who has not noticed your and who is not in combat.
        If she make a melee sneak attack against that target within 1 round, your attack deals maximum damage, including your sneak attack damage.
        If the target becomes aware of your presence before you attack, this ability has no benefit.

    \subsection{Warp Damage}\label{Warp Damage}
        A spellwarped can use the innate magic within your body to generate powerful magical effects.
        However, doing so is physically taxing.
        Most spellwarped abilities cause the spellwarped to take some amount of \glossterm{warp damage}.
        Warp damage cannot be cured by effects that restore hit points, effectively reducing the spellwarped's maximum hit points.

        A spellwarped cannot voluntarily take warp damage that would exceed half your maximum hit points.
        An hour of rest cures warp damage equal to a character's level.

    \subsection{Base Class Abilities}
        A character with spellwarped as a base class gains the following abilities.

        \classbasics{Skill Points} 5.

        \classbasics{Defenses} \plus4 to one defense, \plus2 to other defenses (see the Innate Magic ability, below).

        \classbasics{Action Points} \plus3.

        \cf{Spl}{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
        A spellwarped is proficient with simple weapons, any two weapon groups, light and medium armor, and shields.

        \cf{Spl}{Warp Regeneration}[Mag]
        The spellwarped does not need to rest to cure warp damage.
        He automatically heals warp damage equal to your level every hour, regardless of any activity he takes in the meantime.
        If he rests, he also recovers warp damage for resting, doubling the warp damage he heals.

    \subsection{Class Abilities}
        All spellwarped have the following abilities.

        \cf{Spl}{Spellpower}
        The strength of a spellwarped's spells and abilities are determined by your spellpower.
        Your spellpower is equal to your key attribute or your character level, whichever is higher.

        \cf{Spl}{Innate Magic}
        Each spellwarped draws your magical power from a particular kind of magic.
        This is a choice made when the first level of the class is taken, and it cannot thereafter be changed.
        The choices are listed below.
        Your choice of innate magic is not a \glossterm{magical} ability, but the active ability granted by that choice is a magical ability.

        \subcf{Alteration}
        The spellwarped can manipulate the physical forms of creatures.
        Your good defense is Fortitude, your key attribute is Intelligence, and he treats Disguise, Escape Artist, and Jump as class skills.
        An alteration spellwarped may be called an alterer, bodywarper, or shifter.

        As a standard action, he can change minor aspects of your appearance, such as removing a mole or lengthening your beard.
        This can grant you a \plus2 bonus to Disguise checks.
        Major changes are not possible.

        \subcf{Pyromancy}
        The spellwarped can manipulate fire and heat.
        Your good defense is Fortitude, your key attribute is Willpower, and he treats Acrobatics, Jump, and Sprint as class skills.
        A pyromancy spellwarped may be called a pyromancer.

        As a standard action, he can snap your fingers to create a small ember of flame in your hand for 5 minutes.
        This ember casts light as a torch, and can deal 1 point of fire damage with a successful touch attack.
        It can be dismissed as a swift action or extinguished as a move action.

        \subcf{Telekinesis}
        The spellwarped can manipulate objects and creatures with your mind.
        Your good defense is Mental, your key attribute is Willpower, and he treats Devices, Escape Artist, and Sleight of Hand as class skills.
        A telekinesis spellwarped may be called a telekine.

        As a standard action, he can concentrate to move objects within ten feet of you telekinetically.
        He can slowly lift or manipulate one object by up to one foot per round.
        The object can weigh up to five pounds.
        This level of control is insufficient to make skill checks or wield a weapon or shield effectively.

        \subcf{Temporal}
        The spellwarped can manipulate time.
        Your good defense is Reflex, your key attribute is Perception, and he treats Awareness, Sleight of Hand, and Sprint as class skills.
        A temporal spellwarped may be called a temporalist or timewarper.

        The spellwarped always knows exactly what time it is, and can track the passage of time precisely without effort.

        \cf{Spl}{Invocation}
        A spellwarped can invoke your innate magic to generate powerful effects.
        He chooses a single invocation at 1st level from those available based on your choice of innate magic.
        Using an invocation inflicts \glossterm{warp damage} to the spellwarped equal to half the minimum spellwarped level required to learn the invocation (minimum 1).

        At your 4th spellwarped level, and every two spellwarped levels thereafter, he gains an additional invocation.
        Some invocations have minimum spellwarped levels, as indicated in the title of the ability.
        The list of invocations is given at \pcref{Invocations}.

        The spellwarped's accuracy with invocations is equal to your spellpower.

        \cf{Spl}[2nd]{Spellwarped Body}[Mag]
        The spellwarped's body is fundamentally altered by exposure to magic.
        He shows signs of the magic coursing through your body: strangely or inconsistently colored hair, natural skin markings which often resemble runes, and so on.
        Anyone observing the spellwarped can make an Awareness or Spellcraft check with a DR equal to 20 \sub your spellwarped level to recognize that the character is a spellwarped.
        Critical success on the check allows the observer to determine the type of innate magic the spellwarped has.
        In addition, the spellwarped gains an ability based on your innate magic.
        \subcf{Alteration -- Sturdy Body}
        The spellwarped gains a \plus2 bonus to your Fortitude defense.
        This bonus increases by 1 at spellpower 5 and every 5 spellpower thereafter.
        \subcf{Pyromancy -- Energy Resistance}
        The spellwarped gains \glossterm{damage reduction} against cold and fire damage equal to twice your spellpower.
        \subcf{Telekinesis -- Tactile Telekinesis}
        The spellwarped gains a \plus2 bonus to Strength and Dexterity-based checks.
        This bonus increases by 1 at spellpower 5 and every 5 spellpower thereafter.
        \subcf{Temporal -- Accelerated Movement}
        The spellwarped gains a \plus2 bonus to your Reflex defense and a \plus10 foot bonus to your movement speed.
        At spellpower 8, 14, and 20, the defense bonus increases by 1 and the speed bonus increases by 10 feet.

        \cf{Spl}[3rd]{Magical Senses}[Mag]
        The spellwarped learns to recognize the telltale signs of your chosen magic.
        He must concentrate as a standard action to use this ability, and he may do so any number of times per day.
        \subcf{Alteration -- Perceive Alteration}
        The spellwarped can discern the true form of all creatures within 50 feet of you for 1 round, ignoring any effects which magically alter their shapes.
        This also grants you a \plus5 bonus to Awareness checks to see through disguises.
        \subcf{Pyromancy -- Flame of Life}
        The spellwarped can see the life-fire that lies within all living creatures, allowing you to clearly see all living creatures within 50 feet of you for 1 round.
        It also allows the spellwarped to see unusually warm objects, such as fires.
        This is a \glossterm{Detection} ability, and it can penetrate up to 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.
        \subcf{Telekinesis -- Spatial Awareness}
        The spellwarped can feel the forms of all objects and creatures around you, granting blindsense out to a 50 foot range for 1 round.
        \subcf{Temporal -- Rapid Search}
        The spellwarped can accelerate your mind to immediately search everything within a 10 foot radius of you with the Awareness skill as a standard action.
        Alternately, he may use this ability to read a book ten times as fast as normal.

        \cf{Spl}[3rd]{Spellwarped Aspect}[Mag]
        The spellwarped gains a new ability based on your continued exposure to magical energy.
        Most aspects are specific to particular kinds of innate magic, but some aspects can be taken by any spellwarped.
        These aspects are listed under the General heading.

        At your 7th spellwarped level, and every four spellwarped levels thereafter, the spellwarped gains an additional spellwarped aspect.
        Some aspects require a minimum spellwarped level, as indicated in the title of the ability.
        The full list of spellwarped aspects is given below.

        \parhead{General}

        \subcf{Resilient}
        The spellwarped increases the defense improved by your choice of innate magic by 2.
        This can increase your hit points, if appropriate.
        \subcf{Spellwarped Ritualist} The spellwarped can learn and perform rituals as if he were an arcane caster with a spellpower equal to your spellwarped spellpower.  The maximum level of ritual that he can learn or perform is equal to half your spellwarped level or half your spellwarped key attribute, whichever is lower.
        In addition, he gains an ability based on which type of spellwarped he is.
        \begin{itemize}
            \itemhead{Alteration} If a ritual requires a specific component with a value, the spellwarped can substitute its equivalent value in ritual components instead.
                This cannot be used to replace components without a value or components with special properties that alter the ritual's effect, such as the body for a \spell{resurrection} ritual.
            \itemhead{Pyromancy}
                The spellwarped can use any combustable item as a ritual component.
                It can replace an amount of normal ritual components equal to the value of the item.
                It cannot replace special ritual components.
            \itemhead{Telekinesis}
                The spellwarped can perform rituals from up to 30 feet away from the ritual components.
            \itemhead{Temporal}
                The spellwarped performs rituals twice as quickly.
        \end{itemize}
        \subcf{7th -- Warp Overload}
        The spellwarped can voluntarily take \glossterm{warp damage}, even if that would exceed half your maximum hit points.
        He is only unable to voluntarily take warp damage if the total warp damage would exceed your maximum hit points.
        \subcf{11th -- Persistent Senses}
        The spellwarped can constantly gain the benefit of your magical senses ability.
        He can toggle your enhanced senses on or off as a swift action.
        If the ability does not have a duration, such as the temporal magical senses ability, this aspect has no effect.

        \cf{Spl}[2nd]{Surge of Power}[Mag]
        \subcf{Telekinesis -- Kinetic Deflection}
        The spellwarped reflexively deflects attacks away with your mind.
        He gains a \plus2 bonus to your \glossterm{physical defenses}.

        The spellwarped accelerates your movement and reactions.
        He gains a \plus2 bonus to your Reflex defense and a \plus10 foot bonus to your movement speed.

        \parhead{Alteration}
        \subcf{Alter Movement}
        The spellwarped gains your choice of the Acrobatics Mastery, Climb Mastery, Jump Mastery, or Swim Mastery feats.
        He may select this aspect multiple times, choosing a different bonus feat each time.
        \subcf{7th -- Damage Reduction}
        The spellwarped gains \glossterm{damage reduction} against physical damage equal to your spellpower.
        Adamantine weapons ignore this damage reduction and negate it for 1 round.
        \subcf{11th -- Alter Size}
        As a standard action, the spellwarped can grow or shrink by one size category, up to a maximum of one size category different from your normal size.
        This effect lasts until he uses this ability again.
        This is a \glossterm{Sizing} effect, and does not stack with other Sizing effects.
        \subcf{11th -- Regeneration}
        At the end of each round, the spellwarped heals hit points equal to your spellpower.

        \parhead{Pyromancy}
        \subcf{Flame Aura}
        The spellwarped emanates an aura of fire.
        At the end of each round, enemies adjacent to you take fire damage equal to your spellpower.

        \subcf{Intense Flames}
        The spellwarped can choose to have your spellwarped abilities ignore an amount of fire damage reduction equal to your spellpower.

        \subcf{7th -- Retributive Flames}
        When a creature makes a melee attack against the spellwarped, it takes \spelldamage{fire}[d6].
        Each creature can only take this damage once per round.
        \subcf{11th -- Intense Flame}
        The spellwarped gains a bonus to fire damage with all invocations equal to the number of dice he would roll for that invocation's fire damage.
        This does not affect invocations that do not deal fire damage.

        \parhead{Telekinesis}
        \subcf{Kinetic Deflection}
        The spellwarped may use your Intelligence in place of your Dexterity or Constitution to determine your \glossterm{physical defenses}.
        \subcf{Improved Object Manipulation}
        When the spellwarped uses your object manipulation ability, he can affect objects within 10 feet, with a weight limit of up to two pounds per spellpower.
        He has enough control to make checks with a DR of up to 10.
        \subcf{7th -- Force Barrier}
        The spellwarped gains a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{physical defenses}.
        \subcf{7th -- Shieldbearer}
        The spellwarped may wield shields, except tower shields, telekinetically.
        The shield floats in your square, granting you its bonus to your physical defenses just as if he were wielding it.
        He does not need a free hand to wield the shield, and suffers no arcane spell failure for its use, though he is still affected by its \glossterm{encumbrance penalty}.
        The shield follows you as he moves.
        If it is forcibly removed from your square, he loses control over it and it falls to the ground.
        \subcf{11th -- Mind Armory}
        The spellwarped may control a number of weapons equal to half your Intelligence with your mind blade ability.
        This does not allow you to make additional attacks per round, but he may attack interchangeably with any weapon he controls.
        Each weapon threatens an area and contributes to overwhelm penalties, just as with your normal mind blade ability.

        \parhead{Temporal}
        \subcf{Accelerate Mind}
        The spellwarped gains a \plus2 bonus to Intelligence-based and Perception-based checks.
        \subcf{Sprint Mastery}
        The spellwarped gains the Sprint Mastery feat (see page \featpref{Sprint Mastery}).
        \subcf{Swift}
        The spellwarped gains the Swift feat (see page \featpref{Swift}).
        \subcf{Uncanny Dodge}
        The spellwarped can react to danger before your senses would normally allow you to do so.
        He reduces your overwhelm penalties by 1.
        If your overwhelm penalty is reduced to 0, he is not considered to be overwhelmed.
        In addition, he is not \unaware when attacked by surprise.
        \subcf{7th -- Improved Uncanny Dodge}
        The spellwarped reduces your overwhelm penalties by 2.
        If your overwhelm penalty is reduced to 0, he is not considered to be overwhelmed.
        \subcf{15th -- Accelerate Attack}
        Whenever the spellwarped makes a \glossterm{standard attack}, he can make an additional \glossterm{strike} at a \minus5 penalty.
        This does not stack with any other effects which grant extra strikes.

        \cf{Spl}[5th]{Manipulate Magic}[Su]
        The spellwarped can channel your innate magic to manipulate magical abilities.
        Using this ability causes the spellwarped to take \glossterm{warp damage} equal to half the \glossterm{power} of the target ability.
        \subcf{Alteration -- Absorption}
        As an immediate action, when the spellwarped makes successfully resists an attack against your Fortitude from a magical ability, he may absorb the magic harmlessly into your body.
        It has no effect on you, even if it would normally have an effect on a failed attack.
        \subcf{Pyromancy -- Fuel the Flame}
        As an immediate action, when you are affected by a magical ability, he may channel its energy into a burst of flame around you.
        Enemies within a \areamed radius of the spellwarped take fire damage equal to your spellpower.
        The spell still has its normal effect on the spellwarped.
        \subcf{Telekinesis -- Mind over Matter}
        As an immediate action, when you are subject to an attack against your Fortitude from a magical ability, he may use your Mental defense instead.
        \subcf{Temporal -- Accelerate Magic}
        As a swift action, the spellwarped can halve the duration of any magical ability affecting you.
        This can end the effect immediately if it has less than one round remaining.
        If this would reduce the duration by more than one day, the duration is instead reduced by one day.

        \cf{Spl}[9th]{Magic Resistance}[Mag]
        The magic within the spellwarped allows you to completely ignore other magic, granting you \glossterm{magic resistance} equal to 10 \add your Constitution or level, whichever is higher.

        \cf{Spl}[13th]{Improved Manipulate Magic}[Mag]
        The spellwarped can use your manipulate magic ability to affect any ally within \rngmed range of you.

    \subsection{Invocations}\label{Invocations}

        All invocations are \glossterm{magical} abilities unless otherwise noted.

        Some invocations mimic the effects of spells.
        The spellwarped's spellpower with these effects is equal to your spellpower with the spellwarped class.

        \subsubsection{Alteration Invocations}
            \subcf{1st -- Body Bludgeon}
            The spellwarped distorts a part of your body and strikes a foe with it.
            He makes a Spellpower vs. Armor defense physical attack against a foe within your \glossterm{reach}.
            This attack scores critical hits like other physical attacks.
            Success means the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per two spellpower \add half your Strength.
            Failure means the target takes half damage.
            \par At your 4th spellwarped level, this damage increases to 1d6 bludgeoning damage per spellpower \add half your Strength.
            \subcf{1st -- Shrink}
            This invocation functions like the \spell{shrink} spell.

            \subcf{4th -- Purge}
            The spellwarped can end any single effect or condition on you which requires a successful attack against your Fortitude.
            If he identify the effects on you, such as with a Spellcraft check, he may freely choose which effect to end.

            \subcf{6th -- Amorphous Body}
            The spellwarped transforms your body into an amorphous form for \durshort duration.
            In this form, he gains several benefits.

            While moving through spaces smaller than he could normally move through, he moves at half speed.
            \subcf{6th -- Healing Transformation}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped can heal a creature within \rngclose range by transforming it into a healthier version of its normal body.
            The target heals 1d6 points of damage per spellpower.
            This also removes any of the following conditions: blinded, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, sickened, and poisoned.
            \subcf{6th -- Mighty Throw}
            This invocation functions like the \spell{mighty throw} spell.

            \subcf{8th -- Bludgeon the Horde}

            Success deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage per two spellpower \add half your Strength.
            Failure deals half damage.
            \subcf{8th -- Flight}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped can grow wings that last for 5 rounds.
            The wings grant you a fly speed equal to your land speed.
            While \unencumbered, he can fly (see \pcref{Flying}).
            He can only fly for a number of rounds equal to half your spellpower, even if he uses this ability again to extend the duration of the wings.
            After that limit is reached, he must rest for 5 minutes before flying again.

            \subcf{12th -- Reinforced Flight}
            This functions like the flight invocation, except that the spellwarped can fly while encumbered.

        \subsubsection{Pyromancy Invocations}
            Unless otherwise noted, a pyromancer's invocations are \glossterm{Fire} effects, and shed light equivalent to a torch for their duration.

            \subcf{1st -- Burn}
            The spellwarped makes a Spellpower vs. Reflex defense attack against a foe within \rngmed range.
            Success means the target takes \spelldamage{fire}[d6].
            Critical success deals double damage.
            Failure means the target takes half damage.
            \par At your 4th spellwarped level, this damage increases to \spelldamage{fire}.
            \subcf{1st -- Flame Weapon}
            As a swift action, the spellwarped can create a weapon made of flame that lasts for 5 rounds.
            The weapon is sized appropriately for you, and may take the form of any weapon he is proficient with.
            He can attack with the weapon as if it were a normal weapon of its type, except that you use your spellpower to determine your damage in place of your level or Strength, and all damage dealt with the weapon is fire damage.
            All other damage modifiers apply normally.
            \par If the flame weapon leaves your hand, it is extinguished 1 round later.

            \subcf{4th -- Fiery Protection}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped can bestow fire and cold damage reduction equal to twice your spellpower on a creature within 30 feet of you.

            As a standard action, the spellwarped can wreath a willing creature within \rngclose range in flame for \durshort duration.
            Whenever a creature makes a melee attack against the target, the attacking creature takes \spelldamage{fire}[d6].
            A creature can only be dealt damage by this spell once per round.

            \subcf{6th -- Conflagration}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped can release a powerful explosion of flame.
            He makes a Spellpower vs. Reflex attack against everything within a \areamed radius burst of you.
            Success against a target means it takes \spelldamage{fire}[d8].

            Failure against a target means it takes half damage.
            \subcf{6th -- Fireball}
            This invocation functions like the \spell{fireball} spell.
            \subcf{6th -- Ignite}
            The spellwarped makes a Spellpower vs. Reflex attack against a foe within \rngclose range.
            Success means the target takes \spelldamage{fire}, and is \ignited for 2 rounds.
            Critical success deals double damage.
            Failure means the target takes half damage, but is still ignited.

            \subcf{8th -- Firestride}
            As a move action, the spellwarped can teleport to any active flame of at least Tiny size within \rngmed range.
            When he does so, he immolates himself and disappears into a pile of ash before stepping out from the flame unharmed.
            An ordinary torch is sufficient flame to teleport to, but not a candle.
            \subcf{8th -- Flameheart}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped can become a being of pure fire for \durshort duration.
            In this form, he is immune to physical damage and can pass through openings as small as one inch at no movement penalty.
            However, he cannot attack normally or use any of your items, as they meld into your body.
            He may use any of your invocations normally.
            In addition, as a standard action, he can make a Spellpower vs. Reflex attack to touch a creature.
            Success means the target takes \spelldamage{fire}.
            Critical success deals double damage.
            \subcf{8th -- Flight of the Phoenix}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped can create wings of flame that last for 5 rounds.
            The wings grant you a fly speed equal to your land speed.
            While \unencumbered, he can fly (see \pcref{Flying}).
            \subcf{10th -- Lifeseeking Flame}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped fires an orb of flame at a target within \rnglong range.
            If he does not target a creature, the flame automatically strikes a living creature within range.
            It is able to unerringly strike creatures you cannot see or are not aware of, including invisible or concealed creatures.
            You can direct the orb to avoid specific targets, allowing you to strike a hidden foe among your allies.
            If there is no valid target, the orb dissipates harmlessly.
            \par The struck target takes 1d10 fire damage per two spellpower.

            \subcf{14th -- Immolation}
            This invocation functions like the \spell{immolation} spell.

            \subcf{18th -- Phoenix Revival}
            When the spellwarped takes vital damage, he may ignore the damage as an immediate action, even if the vital damage would be sufficient to kill you.
            If he does, he dissolves into a pile of ash for 2 rounds.
            During this time, he can take no actions.
            If the pile of ash remains intact after 2 rounds, you are restored to your normal body.
            He has no hit points remaining, and warp damage equal to half your maximum hit points, but is healed of all vital damage.
            However, if the pile of ash is dispersed, the spellwarped dies.
            The ash cannot be harmed by fire damage, and if the pile of ash would take at least 50 points of fire damage during a round, the spellwarped returns one round sooner.
            The spellwarped may take your normal actions in the round after he is restored.
            \par After using this ability, the spellwarped cannot use it again for 1 hour.

            \subcf{20th -- Immolate}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped makes a Spellpower vs. Fortitude against a foe within \rngclose range to consume it in flames from the inside out.
            Success deals \spelldamageemp{fire}.

            \subcf{1st -- Mind Crush}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped can make a Spellpower vs. Fortitude attack against a creature within \rngclose range.
            Success means the target takes \spelldamage{bludgeoning}[d6] and is \sickened for 2 rounds.
            Critical success deals double damage.
            Failure means the target takes half damage, but is still sickened.
            \par At your 4th spellwarped level, this damage increases to \spelldamage{bludgeoning}.
            \subcf{1st -- Mind Blade}
            As a swift action, the spellwarped can telekinetically wield an unattended weapon within \rngclose range for 5 rounds.
            The weapon must be a light or medium weapon appropriate for your size.
            This allows you to attack with the weapon just as if he were holding it in one hand, except that you use your spellpower in place of your Strength or Dexterity.
            In all other respects, this functions as if he were wielding the weapon normally, including contributing to overwhelm penalties.
            The weapon floats in midair and threatens all squares adjacent to it.
            As a move action, he may move the weapon up to 30 feet in any direction, even vertically.
            If the weapon goes outside of \rngclose range, he loses control of it and it falls to the ground.

            \subcf{4th -- Dual Mind Blade}
            This invocation functions like your mind blade invocation, except that the spellwarped may wield two weapons at once.
            They must stay in the same space, and he may make two-weapon fighting attacks with the weapons, just as if he was wielding them with two hands.
            \subcf{4th -- Mighty Mind Blade}
            This invocation functions like the mind blade invocation, except that the spellwarped may also use a heavy weapon appropriate for your size, allowing you to attack with it just as if he were holding it in two hands.

            \subcf{6th -- Distant Manipulation}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped can mentally manipulate objects and creatures at up to \rngclose range for up to 5 rounds.
            This allows you to take any actions which he could normally take with your hands, using your spellpower in place of your Strength or Dexterity, as appropriate.

            \subcf{8th -- Immobilize}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped can make a creature within \rngmed range of you \immobilized for 2 rounds.

            \subcf{10th -- Telekinetic Blast}
            This invocation functions like the \spell{telekinetic blast} spell.

        \subsubsection{Temporal Invocations}
            Unless otherwise noted, all temporal invocations are \glossterm{Temporal} effects.

            \subcf{Decelerate}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped can attempt to slow a creature down.
            He makes a Spellpower vs. Mental attack against a creature within \rngmed range.
            Success means the target is \immobilized for 2 rounds.
            Failure means it moves at half speed for 2 rounds.
            \subcf{Timelock}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped can attempt to lock a creature in time.
            He makes a Spellpower vs. Mental attack against an adjacent creature.
            Success means the target slips out of time for 1 round.
            During that time, it can take no actions, but cannot be harmed, moved, or affected in any way.
            Critical success means it slips selectively out of time for 1 round.
            During that time, it can take no actions, but can be harmed or moved as normal.
            It is not considered \helpless.
            \par A creature affected by this ability is immune to the effect for 5 rounds, even if the attack failed.

            \subcf{4th -- Disjointed Time}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped chaotically disrupts the local flow of time of a creature within \rngclose range.
            The target is \impaired with attacks and checks for 5 rounds.
            \subcf{4th -- Haste}
            This invocation functions like the \spell{haste} spell.

            \subcf{6th -- Flash Step}
            As a move action, the spellwarped can accelerate a willing creature within \rngclose range so much that he can seem to pause time for everyone but the target.
            This allows the target to immediately take a single move action.
            During this move action, the target moves at double speed, cannot be followed or withdrawn from, and may move through squares occupied by creatures or threatened by blocking enemies without penalty.
            The target still suffers the effects of any environmental hazards.
            \subcf{6th -- Slow}
            This invocation functions like the \spell{slow} spell.

            \subcf{8th -- Inhuman Speed}
            As a move action, the spellwarped can accelerate himself to immense speed, allowing you to move up to five times your speed.
            During this time, he cannot be followed or withdrawn from, can move through squares occupied by enemies or threatened by blocking enemies without penalty, and can treat liquids as if they were solid ground.

            \subcf{10th -- Timestream}
            The spellwarped manipulates time in a \arealarge, 10 ft.\ wide line-shaped zone that extends out from you for 5 rounds.
            All creatures and objects that pass through the line are \slowed for 1 round.
            The spellwarped can exclude your allies from the effect.
            The timestream is virtually invisible, requiring a DR 30 Awareness check to notice in a clear environment, though objects passing through the effect can make it more obvious.
            \subcf{10th -- Mass Haste}
            This invocation functions like the \spell{haste} spell with the Mass augment applied.

            \subcf{12th -- Mass Flash Step}
            This invocation functions like the flashstep invocation, except that it affects up to five willing creatures.
            \subcf{12th -- Mass Slow}
            This invocation functions like the \spell{slow} spell with the Mass augment applied.

            \subcf{16th -- Time Reversal}
            As a swift action, the spellwarped can take one warp damage to create a ``time lock.'' The time lock persists for one round.
            As a standard action, he can take eight warp damage to make a Spellpower vs. Mental attack a creature within \rngmed range to reverse time for it.
            Success means the target is restored to its exact condition at the point immediately after the time lock was created.
            The effects of any actions that the creature took in the intervening time are undone, any damage it dealt or took is removed, it is returned to its original location, and the creature is restored in all other ways, just as if the intervening time had never occured.
            If its original location is occupied, the time reversal fails.
            The spellwarped cannot reverse time for himself in this way.
            \par After reversing time in this way, the spellwarped must wait 5 rounds before he can create a time lock or reverse time again.
            \subcf{16th -- Supreme Acceleration}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped can accelerate himself so much that he can take an additional round of actions immediately.
            During this round, all creatures he attacks are treated as \helpless, but he cannot perform a \glossterm{coup de grace} or similar ability; such an act requires more care and precision than is possible with such immense speed.
            After using this ability, he must wait 5 rounds before he can use it again.

            \subcf{18th -- Time Stop}
            As a standard action, the spellwarped can step into an alternate timestream, causing you to speed up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen.
            He can act for 1d3\plus1 rounds of apparent time.
            During this time, all objects and creatures are frozen in place and are completely invulnerable to the spellwarped, though he may affect them with invocations normally.
            After using this ability, he must wait 5 rounds before he can use it again.

\section{Multiclass Characters}\label{Multiclass Characters}
    A character may add new classes as he or you progress in level, thus becoming a multiclass character.
    The class abilities from a character's different classes combine to determine a multiclass character's overall abilities.
    Multiclassing improves a character's versatility at the expense of focus.

    \subsection{Class And Level Features}
        As a general rule, the abilities of a multiclass character are the sum
        of the abilities of each of the character's classes.

        \parhead{Level}
        ``Character level'' is a character's total number of levels.
        It is used to determine when feats and attribute score boosts are gained, as noted on \tref{Character Advancement}.
        Whenever a creature's ``level'' is specified, without reference to a particular class, the character level is used.

        \par ``Class level'' is a character's level in a particular class.
        For a character whose levels are all in the same class, character level and class level are the same.

        \parhead{Hit Points}
        The normal rules for determining hit points apply to multiclass characters.

        \parhead{Defenses}
        The normal rules for determining defenses apply to multiclass characters.

        \parhead{Skills}
        A multiclass character gains all class skills from all of your classes.
        However, only the character's base class grants skill points.
        If a character has multiple base classes, he must choose which base class grants skill points.
        When a character gains new class skills, he may redistribute your skill points to gain training or mastery in your new class skills.

        \parhead{Class Abilities}
        A multiclass character gets all the class abilities of all your or your classes, but must also suffer the consequences of the special restrictions of all your or your classes.

        \par In some cases, two classes can have virtually identical abilities.
        Use the following guidelines to determine how abilities stack.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If two identical class abilities are not based on level and are not gained following a specific pattern, they do not stack.
            \item If two identical class abilities are not explicitly based on level, but both classes gain them in a predictable pattern, the levels of the two classes stack for determining when the next improvement to the class ability will be gained.
            \item If two identical class abilities are explicitly based on level, the levels of the two classes stack for determining the power of the ability.
            \item If two identical class abilities say how they stack, those rules trump any other rules.
        \end{itemize}
        These are some examples of how to use these guidelines.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Both a druid and a ranger gain wild speech.
                A druid/ranger who has wild speech from both classes has the same wild speech ability as a druid or ranger would.
            \item Both a barbarian and a rogue get uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge at the same level.
                A barbarian/rogue adds your barbarian and rogue levels together to determine when he acquires improved uncanny dodge.
        \end{itemize}

        \parhead{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}
        Only a character's base class grants weapon and armor proficiencies.
        If a character has multiple base classes, she must choose which base class grants weapon and armor profiencies.
