\chapter{Core Mechanics}

This chapter describes the core mechanics of Rise.
It defines how attributes work and explains how to make physical attacks in combat.

\section{Attacks and Checks}\label{Attacks and Checks}
    You can take many actions without needing to roll a die at all.
    However, eventually you will need to do something where there is a dramatically significant chance of failure.
    In that case, you will need to roll a die to see if you succeed or fail.
    Almost all rolls you will need to make can be described as an \glossterm{attack roll} or a \glossterm{check}.

    \subsection{Attack Rolls}
        Attack rolls are required to make \glossterm{attacks}.
        Anything that affects another creature in a potentially harmful way, such as striking a creature with a sword, is an attack.
        Many abilities are always considered attacks, even if you use them in a way that you believe is not harmful.

        To make an attack roll, roll 1d10 and add your \glossterm{accuracy} with the attack.
        The sum of your die roll and your accuracy is called your \glossterm{attack result}.
        You compare your attack result to a \glossterm{defense} that your \glossterm{target} has (see \pcref{Defenses}).
        All attacks specify which defense they are compared to.
        If your result is at least equal to your target's defense, the attack succeeds.
        This almost always means the target suffers some harmful effect, such as taking \glossterm{damage}.
        Otherwise, the attack fails.

        \subsubsection{Exploding Attacks}\label{Exploding Attacks}
            When you make an attack roll, if you roll a 10 on the d10, the die \glossterm{explodes}.
            In addition, some effects can cause your roll to \glossterm{explode} without rolling a 10.
            For example, if you attack an \glossterm{unaware} target, your attack roll explodes regadless of the roll.

            When an attack roll \glossterm{explodes}, you roll it again and add the second result to the original result before applying your \glossterm{accuracy}.
            If you roll a 10 on the extra roll, you keep rolling until you stop rolling a 10 and add all of the rolls together.
            % Is this necessary text?
            No effect can cause extra rolls to explode without rolling a 10.

        \subsubsection{Critical Hit}\label{Critical Hit}
            If your attack result is at least 10 higher than your target's defense, your attack is a \glossterm{critical hit}.
            Many attacks have special effects on critical hits.
            Unless its critical hit effects are otherwise noted, any attack that deals damage deals double that damage on a critical hit.

            Objects are not normally subject to critical hits.
            Some creatures are also not subject to critical hits, as noted in their descriptions.

    \subsection{Checks}\label{Checks}
        Checks are required to perform actions that have a chance of failure that are not attacks.
        For example, climbing a wall or remembering an obscure piece of trivia may require a check.

        To make a check, roll 1d10 and add your \glossterm{check modifier} with the check.
        You compare the die result, including your check modifier, to a \glossterm{difficulty rating} (DR) that represents the difficulty of the task.
        The more difficult the task, the higher the DR will be.
        If your result is at least equal to the DR, the check succeeds.
        This usually means you accomplish a task successfully.
        Normal Difficulty Ratings are described in \tref{Difficulty Ratings}.

        \begin{dtable}
            \lcaption{Difficulty Ratings}
            \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{p{8em} X}
                \tb{Difficulty (DR)} & \tb{Example (Skill Used)} \\
                \bottomrule
                Trivial (0)      & Hear a coversation from 10 feet away (Awareness)                          \\
                Average (5)      & Tie or untie a typical knot (Devices)                                     \\
                Tough (10)       & Swim in rough water (Swim)                                                \\
                Challenging (15) & Balance on a one-inch wide wood beam (Acrobatics)                         \\
                Heroic (20)      & Open a high quality lock (Devices)                                        \\
                Legendary (25)   & Leap across a 30-foot chasm with a running start (Jump)                   \\
                Epic (30)        & Convince a wise mayor her husband is secretly a werewolf (Persuasion)     \\
                Godlike (40)     & Track three orcs across firm ground after 24 hours of rainfall (Survival) \\
            \end{dtabularx}
        \end{dtable}

        \subsubsection{Critical Success}
            If your check result is at least 10 higher than the DR, your check is a \glossterm{critical success}.
            Some checks have a special effect on a critical success.
            For example, a critical success while climbing means you move twice as quickly (see \pcref{Climb}).

        \subsubsection{Critical Failure}
            If your check result is at least 10 lower than the DR, your check is a \glossterm{critical failure}.
            Some checks have a special effect on a critical failure, which is usually bad for the character making the check.
            For example, a critical failure while climbing means you fall (see \pcref{Climb}).

\section{Combat Time}\label{Combat Time}
    The world of Rise can be a harsh one, and not all disagreements can be resolved peacefully.
    At some point, you will be forced to enter combat.
    This section explains how time passes in combat.

    \subsection{Rounds}\label{Rounds}

        Combat takes place in a series of \glossterm{rounds}, which represent about six seconds of time.
        Each round of a combat is divided into three \glossterm{phases} (see \pcref{Phases}).
        After all phases are complete, the round ends and the next round begins.

    \subsection{Actions}\label{Actions}

        You can take actions in combat to defeat your foes.
        There are four types of actions: \glossterm{standard actions}, \glossterm{minor actions}, \glossterm{move actions}, and \glossterm{free actions}.
        % TODO: define conflicting action limits (drawing a sword and sheathing a shield?)

        \subsubsection{Standard Actions}\label{Standard Actions}
            Most common activities require a \glossterm{standard action}, such as attacking with a weapon, casting a spell, and using many special abilities.
            Using a standard action generally takes about three seconds of time within the game, and it requires most of your attention during that time.

            You can take one standard action per round.

        \subsubsection{Minor Actions}\label{Minor Actions}
            Some special abilities require a \glossterm{minor action}.
            Using a minor action does not take much time or attention, and it can be done at the same time as any other actions.

            You can normally take one minor action per round.
            However, you can choose to take an additional minor action in place of a \glossterm{standard action}.

        \subsubsection{Move Actions}\label{Move Actions}
            You can move around a battlefield as a \glossterm{move action}.
            Using a move action generally takes about three seconds of time within the game, and it requires most of your attention during that time.

            You can normally take one move action per round.
            However, you can choose to take an additional move action in place of a \glossterm{standard action}.

        \subsubsection{Free Actions}\label{Free Actions}
            Many minor activities require a \glossterm{free action}, such as drawing or sheathing a weapon.
            Using a free action does not take much time or attention, and it can be done at the same time as any other actions.

            You can take any number of free actions per round.

    \subsection{Phases}\label{Phases}

        There are three \glossterm{phases} in each round: a \glossterm{movement phase}, an \glossterm{action phase}, and sometimes a \glossterm{delayed action phase}.
        Each phase specifies the types of actions that can be taken during that phase.
        As a special case, \glossterm{free actions} may be taken during any phase.

        \subsubsection{The Movement Phase}\label{The Movement Phase}
            During the \glossterm{movement phase}, you can take one \glossterm{move action}.
            The most common move action is the \textit{hustle} ability, which allows you to move a distance equal to your \glossterm{speed}.
            For details, see \pcref{Movement and Positioning}.

        \subsubsection{The Action Phase}\label{The Action Phase}
            During the \glossterm{action phase}, you can take one \glossterm{minor action} and one \glossterm{standard action}.
            Alternately, you can take a \glossterm{move action} or additional \glossterm{minor action} in place of your standard action.
            Most of the time, you will simply take a single standard action.

        \subsubsection{The Delayed Action Phase}\label{The Delayed Action Phase}
            During the \glossterm{delayed action phase}, you can take a \glossterm{minor action} or \glossterm{standard action} if you did not use the corresponding action in the \glossterm{action phase}.
            Alternately, you can take a \glossterm{move action} or additional \glossterm{minor action} in place of a standard action.
            In addition, some abilities have effects during the delayed action phase instead of or in addition to their effects in the action phase.
            For example, the \textit{charge} ability allows you to move during the action phase and attack during the delayed action phase (see \pcref{Charge}).

    \subsection{Resolving Actions}\label{Resolving Actions}

        Within each phase, actions of all creatures are simultaneously resolved in the following order.
        Allies with the ability to communicate can freely coordinate their actions with each other, within reasonable limits.

        \begin{enumerate*}
            \item Choose actions.
            \item Determine targets affected by actions.
            \item Apply the results of \glossterm{Swift} abilities.
            \item Check action success.
                Example: Making attack rolls.
            \item Determine action results.
                Example: Making damage rolls.
            \item Apply action results.
                Examples: Reducing hit points, moving creature locations, and applying penalties.
        \end{enumerate*}

        In the vast majority of cases, there is no need to go through this order explicitly.
        Combats will run much faster if attack and damage rolls are generally made and announced at the same time as those actions are chosen, even before all characters have explicitly stated their actions.
        The order of resolution matters when creatures take actions that directly conflict with each other.

        \subsubsection{Swift Abilities}\label{Swift Abilities}
            Some abilities resolve before other actions in the same phase.
            These abilities have the \glossterm{Swift} tag.
            They resolve after targets are determined, but before attack rolls are made.
            Swift abilities never require attack rolls, and almost always affect only the creature using the ability.

            For example, the \textit{total defense} ability is a swift ability.
            It increases your defenses against attacks made during the same phase (see \pcref{Total Defense}).

        % This may be too complicated
        \subsubsection{Conflicting Actions}\label{Conflicting Actions}

            Sometimes, actions that occur in the same phase can conflict with each other.
            In this case, each creature involved with conflicting actions in that phase rolls an \glossterm{initiative} check (see \pcref{Initiative}).
            Starting from the highest check result and continuing to the lowest, each creature decides to resolve its chosen action or delay to choose a different action.
            After the lowest initiative check result has made its choice, each creature that delayed can resolve a different action of its choice, starting from the lowest check result and continuing to the highest.
            When deciding, each creature knows the resolved effects of the actions chosen by previous creatures that it can observe.

            When determining whether two actions conflict, it is best to be generous and consider the intention of the action.
            The only downside to treating actions as conflicting is the time required to resolve the initiative checks and consider action changes.

            For example, one of the most common conflicts occurs when a creature tries to move into melee range with a foe that unexpectedly moves away.
            Although the two movements not mutually impossible, the first creature can easily end up out of melee range from all foes at the end of the phase if it doesn't have enough movement to reach its target.
            Treating the movements as conflicting allows the first creature to sprint or change its action if it chooses.

\section{Character Statistics}
    This section explains how character statistics, such as how strong you are or how accurate your attacks are, should be calculated.

    \subsection{Attributes}\label{Attributes}

        Each character has six \glossterm{attributes}: Strength (Str), Dexterity (Dex), Constitution (Con), Intelligence (Int), Perception (Per), and Willpower (Wil).
        Each attribute represents a character's raw talent in that area.
        A 0 in an attribute represents average human capacity.
        That doesn't mean that every commoner has a 0 in every attribute; not everyone is average, after all.

        \subsubsection{Strength (Str)}\label{Strength}
            Strength measures muscle and physical power.
            It has the following effects:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Strength determines how much a character can carry (see \tref{Carrying Capacity by Strength}).
                \item Strength affects Strength-based skills: Climb, Jump, and Swim (see \pcref{Skills}).
                \item If your Strength is negative, you take a penalty to all Strength-based skills equal to your Strength.
                % TODO: wording
                \item If your Strength is negative, you take a penalty to damage with \glossterm{strikes} equal to half your Strength in \glossterm{die increments}.
            \end{itemize}

            If you have a high Strength, you can use it to determine several statistics:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Your \glossterm{power} with most \glossterm{mundane} abilities, such as \glossterm{strikes} (see \pcref{Power}).
                \item Your \glossterm{threat} (see \pcref{Threat}).
                \item Your Fortitude defense (see \pcref{Defenses}).
            \end{itemize}

        \subsubsection{Dexterity (Dex)}\label{Dexterity}
            Dexterity measures hand-eye coordination, agility, and reflexes.
            It has the following effects:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Dexterity affects Dexterity-based skills: Acrobatics, Escape Artist, Ride, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth (see \pcref{Skills}).
                \item You gain a bonus (or penalty) to your Reflex defense equal to your starting Dexterity.
                \item If your Dexterity is negative, you take a penalty to all Dexterity-based skills equal to your Dexterity.
            \end{itemize}

            If you have a high Dexterity, you can use it to determine several statistics:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Your \glossterm{accuracy} with melee and thrown \glossterm{strikes} using \glossterm{light weapons} (see \pcref{Accuracy}).
                \item Your Armor and Reflex defenses (see \pcref{Defenses}).
            \end{itemize}

        \subsubsection{Constitution (Con)}\label{Constitution}
            Constitution represents your health and stamina.
            It has the following efects:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item You gain bonus hit points based on your starting Constitution (see \pcref{Hit Points}).
                \item You heal additional hit points when you take a \glossterm{short rest} based on your starting Constitution (see \pcref{Short Rest}).
                \item You gain a bonus (or penalty) to your Fortitude defense equal to your starting Constitution.
                \item You reduce your \textit{encumbrance} for weight or heavy armor by an amount equal to your starting Constitution.
            \end{itemize}

            If you have a high Constitution, you can use it to determine your Fortitude defense (see \pcref{Defenses}).

        \subsubsection{Intelligence (Int)}\label{Intelligence}
            Intelligence represents how well you learn and reason.
            It has the following effects:

            \begin{itemize}
                \item You gain bonus languages equal to your starting Intelligence (see \pcref{Languages}).
                \item You gain extra skill points equal to twice your starting Intelligence (see \pcref{Skill Points}).
                \item Your Intelligence affects Intelligence-based skills: Craft, Deduction, Disguise, Heal, Knowledge, and Linguistics (see \pcref{Skills}).
                \item If your starting Intelligence is negative, you lose skill points equal to twice your starting Intelligence.
                \item If your Intelligence is negative, you take a penalty to all Intelligence-based skills equal to your Intelligence.
            \end{itemize}

            If you have a high Intelligence, you can use it to determine your Mental defense (see \pcref{Defenses}).

            \par An animal has an Intelligence score of \minus6 or lower.
            A creature of humanlike intelligence has a score of at least a \minus5 Intelligence.

        \subsubsection{Perception (Per)}\label{Perception}
            Perception describes your ability to observe and be aware of your surroundings.
            It has the following effects:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Your Perception affects Perception-based skills: Awareness, Creature Handling, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, and Survival (see \pcref{Skills}).
                \item If your Perception is negative, you take a penalty to all Perception-based skills equal to your Perception.
                \item If your Perception is negative, you take a penalty to accuracy with all attacks equal to half your Perception.
            \end{itemize}

            If you have a high Perception, you can use it to determine several statistics:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Your \glossterm{accuracy} with all attacks (see \pcref{Accuracy}).
                \item Your Reflex defense (see \pcref{Defenses}).
            \end{itemize}

        \subsubsection{Willpower (Wil)}\label{Willpower}
            Willpower represents your ability to endure mental hardships.
            It has the following effects:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item You gain a bonus (or penalty) to the number of \glossterm{action points} you have equal to your starting Willpower.
                \item You gain a bonus (or penalty) to your Mental defense equal to your starting Willpower.
            \end{itemize}

            If you have a high Willpower, you can use it to determine several statistics:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Your \glossterm{power} with most \glossterm{magical} abilities (see \pcref{Power}).
                \item Your Mental defense (see \pcref{Defenses}).
            \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Accuracy}\label{Accuracy}
        Your accuracy with an \glossterm{attack} is the number that you add to the \glossterm{attack roll}.
        Your accuracy with an attack is normally equal to the higher of your level and your Perception.
        If you are making a \glossterm{strike} with a \glossterm{light weapon}, you may use your Dexterity in place of your Perception.
        In addition to this base number, your accuracy can include any number of bonuses and penalties from other sources.

        \parhead{Proficiency} Each creature is \glossterm{proficient} with a number of weapons.
        For details about the weapons you can be proficient with, see \pcref{Weapons}.
        Your proficiencies are primarily determined by your class, but some abilities also grant proficiency with additional weapons.
        If you make a \glossterm{physical attack} with a weapon you are not proficient with, you take a \minus2 penalty to accuracy.

    \subsection{Power}\label{Power}
        Many abilities have a \glossterm{power} which represents the overall strength of the ability.
        This determines the ability's \glossterm{standard damage} (see \pcref{Standard Damage}).
        Some abilities also have effects that explicitly depend on the ability's power.
        Unless an ability specifies otherwise, its \glossterm{power} depends on whether it is \glossterm{magical} or \glossterm{mundane}.

        \subsubsection{Magical Power}\label{Magical Power}
            Your power with most \glossterm{magical} abilities is called your \glossterm{magical power}.
            It is normally equal to the higher of your level and your Willpower.
            % TODO: example

        \subsubsection{Mundane Power}\label{Mundane Power}
            Your power with most \glossterm{mundane} abilities is called your \glossterm{mundane power}.
            It is normally equal to the higher of your level and your Strength.
            For example, \glossterm{strikes} use your \glossterm{mundane power} to determine how much damage they deal.

    \subsection{Damage}\label{Damage}
        Some attacks deal damage when they hit.
        Damage does not represent serious physical injury to your body.
        Instead, it represents a depletion of some combination of endurance, luck, or even divine providence that prevents you from suffering more serious injury.
        When you take damage, you reduce your \glossterm{hit points} by that amount (see \pcref{Hit Points}).
        If you have no hit points remaining, you may take that damage as \glossterm{vital damage} instead, which represents potentially life-threatening injuries (see \pcref{Vital Damage}).

        Most attacks deal damage equal to the result rolled from a pool of dice.

        \subsubsection{Die Increments}\label{Die Increments}
            Many abilities can increase or decrease your damage with abilities.
            These modifiers always increase or decrease your damage by one \glossterm{die increment}.
            Increasing by one die increment is written as \plus1d, and decreasing by one die increment is written as \minus1d.
            A set of damage dice can increase in size in \glossterm{die increments}.
            Damage dice change in size using the following pattern:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item 1 damage (minimum)
                \item 1d2
                \item 1d3
                \item 1d4
                \item 1d6
                \item 1d8
                \item 1d10
                \item 2d6
                \item 2d8
                \item 2d10
                \item 4d6
                \item 4d8
                \item 4d10
                \item 5d10
                \item 6d10
            \end{itemize}

            For each die increment that increases the damage, move one space down the list.
            Likewise, for each die increment that decreases the damage, move one space up the list.
            After the damage dice reach 4d10, each additional die increment simply adds an extra 1d10 of damage.

        \subsubsection{Standard Damage}\label{Standard Damage}
            Most damaging effects use \glossterm{standard damage} as a baseline to determine the damage they deal.
            Your \glossterm{standard damage} with an ability is based on that ability's \glossterm{power}, if it has one (see \pcref{Power}).
            Otherwise, it is based on your level.
            In either case, it starts at 1d8 and increases by \plus1d per two power or per two levels.
            This is summarized on \trefnp{Standard Damage}.

        \begin{dtable}
            \lcaption{Standard Damage}
            \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{l X}
                \tb{Power} & \tb{Damage} \\
                0--1   & 1d8  \\
                2--3   & 1d10 \\
                4--5   & 2d6  \\
                6--7   & 2d8  \\
                8--9   & 2d10 \\
                10--11 & 4d6  \\
                12--13 & 4d8  \\
                14--15 & 4d10 \\
                16--17 & 5d10 \\
                18--19 & 6d10 \\
                20--21 & 7d10 \\
                22--23 & 8d10 \\
                24--25\fn{1} & 9d10 \\
            \end{dtabularx}
            1. For values above 25, increase by 1d10 at every even value.
        \end{dtable}

        \subsubsection{Strike Damage}\label{Strike Damage}
            The damage you deal with a single \glossterm{strike} from a weapon is equal to \glossterm{standard damage} based on your \glossterm{mundane power}.
            For example, if you have a Strength of 4, your base damage on a strike would be equal to 2d6.
            When you make a strike with a weapon, you also apply that weapon's damage modifier, if any (see \tref{Weapons}).

    \subsection{Defenses}\label{Defenses}
        Usually, when you are attacked, the attacker has to make an \glossterm{attack roll} against a specific defense.
        If the attack roll is at least as high as that defense, the attack succeeds.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Armor defense (AD): Your Armor defense protects you from normal physical attacks, such as attempts to hit you with a sword.
                It is the most commonly used defense.
            \item Reflex defense: Your Reflex protects you from attacks you can only avoid, such as pit traps.
            \item Fortitude defense: Your Fortitude defense protects you from attacks you have to physically endure or resist, such as poisons and deadly spells.
            \item Mental defense: Your Mental defense protects you from attacks you have to mentally endure or resist, such as terrifying creatures and magical manipulation.
        \end{itemize}

        \subsubsection{Defense Values}\label{Defense Values}

            Each of your defenses is calculated in the following way:

            \begin{figure}[h]
                \centering Level or defense attribute \add class defense bonus \add other bonuses and penalties
            \end{figure}

            The attributes and relevant bonuses which apply to each defense are described in \trefnp{Defense Calculations}.

            \begin{dtable!*}
                \lcaption{Defense Calculations}
                \begin{dtabularx}{\textwidth}{l l l l >{\lcol}X}
                    \tb{Defense Name} & \tb{Attributes} & \tb{Starting Attribute Modifier} & \tb{Body Armor Modifier} & \tb{Shield Modifier} \\
                    \midrule
                    Armor defense     & Dex & \tdash & Yes & Yes \\
                    Fortitude defense & Con or Str & Con & No  & No  \\
                    Reflex defense    & Dex or Per & Dex & No  & Yes \\
                    Mental defense    & Wil or Int & Wil & No  & No  \\
                \end{dtabularx}
            \end{dtable!*}

            \parhead{Class Bonuses} Each class provides bonuses to some combination of Fortitude, Reflex, and Mental defense.
            \parhead{Natural Armor} Creatures with unusually tough skin or thick hide, including most monsters, gain bonuses to their Armor defense.
            These bonuses stack with any armor such creatures might wear.
            \parhead{Size Modifier} Large creatures have a penalty to Reflex defense.
            For details, see \tref{Size in Combat}.

        \subsubsection{Resisting Attacks}
            If an attack fails against you, you almost always suffer no effects from the attack.
            Even if the attack had no obvious physical or visual effects, a creature that resists an attack still feels a hostile force or a tingle, but cannot usually deduce the exact nature of the attack.
            The Spellcraft skill can be used to learn about failed \glossterm{magical} attacks against you (see \pcref{Spellcraft}).

            \parhead{Lowering Defenses} When you are subject to an attack that you are aware of, you can voluntarily lower your defenses against the attack.
            If you do, your defense is treated as 0 against the attack.

    \subsection{Initiative}\label{Initiative}
        When multiple creatures take mutually impossible actions simultaneously, such as racing to be the first one to a door, they must roll initiative checks.
        For details, see \pcref{Conflicting Actions}.
        Your bonus on \glossterm{initiative} checks is normally equal to your Dexterity or Perception, whichever is higher.

        \parhead{Movement-Based Initiative}\label{Movement-Based Initiative}
        When making \glossterm{initiative} checks to determine the success of movement, having a faster movement speed is helpful (see \pcref{Movement and Positioning}).
        For every 5 feet of movement you would have available after completing your movement, you gain a \plus2 bonus to any initiative checks necessary to determine whether your movement succeeds.
        Regardless of whether your initiative check succeeds or fails, you cannot use that ``excess'' movement to move after making such an initiative check.

    \subsection{Threat}\label{Threat}
        Each creature has a value that represents how threatening it is.
        This value is called a creature's \glossterm{threat}.
        Many monsters choose the targets of their attacks based on the threat of their foes.
        Your base threat is equal to the higher of your level and your Strength.
        In addition, you gain bonuses to your threat based on your equipment and some other effects which can make you appear more or less intimidating.

        \subsection{Threat From Equipment}
            If you are visibly wearing \glossterm{body armor}, you gain a bonus to your threat equal to half the defense bonus provided by the armor.
            For this purpose, ignore any abilities that increase the defense bonus you gain from the armor, and only use the base defense bonus from the armor itself.
            If you are visibly wielding a weapon or otherwise obviously capable of inflicting lethal damage, you gain a \plus2 bonus to your threat.

        \subsection{Threat From Size}
            You gain a \plus2 bonus to your threat for each size category that you are larger than Medium.
            Likewise, you take a \minus2 penalty to your threat for each size category that you are smaller than Medium.

        \subsection{Subjective Threat Modifiers}
            In addition to your base \glossterm{threat}, some actions and abilities modify the threat that particular creatures perceive you have.
            The most common threat modifier comes from dealing damage.
            When you deal damage, you gain a \plus2 bonus to threat until the end of the next round against all creatures that know you dealt that damage.

            Some abilities can also increase or decrease your threat against particular creatures.
            For example, the \textit{Conceal Threat} ability from the Bluff skill allows you to lower your apparent threat to creatures that fail to see through the deception (see \pcref{Conceal Threat}).

        \subsection{Consistent Targeting}
            Unless their descriptions state otherwise, monsters prefer to keep attacking the same target rather than changing targets frequently.
            A monster will only change targets based on \glossterm{threat} if the new target has a threat at least 5 points closer to its preference than its current target.

        \subsection{Threat While Incapacitated}
            While you are unconscious or otherwise obviously unable to take hostile actions, you take a \minus10 penalty to threat.
            Many creatures stop attacking unconscious creatures, preferring to focus on targets that can still cause harm.
            It is possible to trick creatures into thinking you are not a threat by playing dead or using similar tactics.

    \subsection{Size in Combat}\label{Size in Combat}
        Your size affects your \glossterm{space} and \glossterm{reach} in combat, your Strength, your Reflex defense, and how easily you overwhelm creatures and are overwhelmed yourself.
        These effects are shown on \trefnp{Size in Combat}.

        \begin{dtable*}
            \lcaption{Size in Combat}
            \begin{dtabularx}{\textwidth}{l l l l p{4em} p{4.5em} p{3em} p{5.5em} X}

        \subsubsection{Space}\label{Space}
            A creature's \glossterm{space} is the area its body occupies while fighting.
            All humanoid races take up a 5-ft.\ by 5-ft.\ space in combat, which is a single \glossterm{square}.
            Normally, other creatures can't be in the space you occupy.
            Most creatures have a space significantly larger than the physical space their body occupies because they need room to maneuver in combat.

        \subsubsection{Reach}\label{Reach}
            A creature's \glossterm{reach} is the distance that its \glossterm{melee attacks} can reach.
            Enemies within a creature's reach are considered \glossterm{threatened}.

        \subsubsection{Base Speed}\label{Base Speed}
            A creature's \glossterm{base speed} is the distance that it can usually move.
            In addition to a base speed, most creatures have specific \glossterm{movement modes} that allow them to move in particular ways.
            The most common movement mode is a land speed, which allows creatures to move across the ground.
            Most creatures, including all humanoid races, have a land speed equal to their base speed.
            There are other movement modes that can allow creatures to move in different ways.
            For example, most birds have a \glossterm{fly speed}, which allows them to move through the air.
            For details about other speeds, see \pcref{Movement Modes}.

        \subsubsection{Other Effects}
            A creature's size affects a number of additional skills and abilities.
            For example, larger creatures have a penalty to Stealth checks (see \pcref{Size and Stealth}).
            The effects of unusual size are described in those skills and abilities.
            Unusually large or small creatures also have other special rules apply to them, as described below.

        \subsubsection{Very Small Creatures}
            \parhead{Space} If a creature takes up less than a single square of space, you can fit multiple creatures in that square. You can fit four Tiny creatures in a square, twenty-five Diminuitive creatures, or 100 Fine creatures.

            \parhead{Reach} Creatures that take up less than 1 square of space typically have a natural reach of 0 feet, meaning they can't reach into adjacent squares. They must enter an opponent's square to attack in melee. You can attack into your own square if you need to, so you can attack such creatures normally. Since they have no natural reach, they do not threaten the squares around them.

            If a creature without a natural reach uses a reach weapon, it gains no benefits or penalties (see \pcref{Reach Weapon}).

            \parhead{Movement} Creatures three size categories smaller than you are not considered obstacles and do not hinder your movement.

        \subsubsection{Very Large Creatures}
            \parhead{Space} Very large creatures take up multiple squares. Anything which affects a single square the creature occupies affects the creature.

            \parhead{Reach} Creatures that take up more than 1 square typically have a natural reach of 10 feet or more, meaning that they can reach targets even if they aren't in adjacent squares. Creatures with a large natural reach can attack anyone within their reach, including adjacent foes.

            Creatures with a large natural reach using reach weapons can strike at up to double their natural reach but can't strike at their natural reach or less, just like Medium sized creatures.

            \parhead{Movement} Creatures three size categories larger than you are not considered obstacles and do not hinder your movement.

            % Should this be two size categories larger, or be more dependent on creature anatomy?
            \parhead{Immunities} Creatures at least three size categories larger than you are difficult to fight. You cannot get a \glossterm{critical hit} with \glossterm{strikes} or contribute to overwhelm penalties against such creatures. If you can reach a vulnerable point on the creature, such as by flying or by using ranged weapons, you can get critical hits and contribute to overwhelm penalties normally.

    \subsection{Circumstances, Bonuses, and Penalties}

        Many effects can grant bonuses or penalties to actions you take.

        \subsubsection{Arbitrary Modifiers}

            Circumstances frequently modify your odds of success when making attacks and checks, or when defending yourself from attacks.
            There are two kinds of circumstantial modifiers.
            Circumstances that make you better or worse at your task give you a bonus or penalty to your attack or check.
            Circumstances that make the task easier or harder increase or decrease the \glossterm{difficulty rating} of the task, or the defense of the attacked creature.

            Most circumstances grant a \plus2 bonus or impose a \minus2 penalty.
            Extraordinary circumstances can potentially have greater modifiers.
            All circumstantial modifiers should be used at the discretion of the GM.\@

        \subsubsection{Overwhelm}\label{Overwhelm}
            When you are being attacked by multiple foes at once, or by a massive foe that can attack from many directions, you are less able to defend yourself.
            You take penalties to your Armor defense equal to half the combined \glossterm{overwhelm value} of all creatures threatening you, rounded down.
            Among equal sized creatures, this usually means you take a penalty equal to half the number of creatures threatening you.
            These penalties are called \glossterm{overwhelm penalties}.
            If you are suffering at least a \minus1 overwhelm penalty, you are \glossterm{overwhelmed}.

            \parhead{Overwhelm Value}\label{Overwhelm Value} Your \glossterm{overwhelm value} affects how much of a penalty you impose on creatures you threaten, as described above.
            For example, Medium creatures have an overwhelm value of 1, and larger creatures have a higher overwhelm value (see \pcref{Size in Combat}).
            Some abilities can affect your overwhelm value.

            Some creatures have fractional overwhelm values.
            For example, a Tiny creature has an overwhelm value of 1/2.
            Fractional overwhelm values are not rounded down until after being added with the overwhelm values from other threatening creatures.
            For example, if five Tiny creatures were threatening a single creature, their combined overwhelm value would be 2 and 1/2.
            That value is rounded down to 2 when determining whether the creature is overwhelmed, and how large that creature's overwhelm penalties are.

            If your \glossterm{overwhelm value} would be reduced below 1, special rules apply.
            The first -1 penalty reduces your overwhelm value to 1/2.
            An additional -1 penalty reduces your overwhelm value to 1/4.
            Your overwhelm value cannot be reduced below 1/4.

            \parhead{Overwhelm Resistance}\label{Overwhelm Resistance} Some abilities grant \glossterm{overwhelm resistance}.
            For example, Large and larger creatures automatically gain overwhelm resistance (see \pcref{Size in Combat}).
            A creature with overwhelm resistance treats creatures threating it as if their \glossterm{overwhelm value} was reduced by amount equal to the creatures overwhelm resistance.
            Some abilities can increase or decrease overwhelm resistance, such as the \spell{boon of many eyes} subspell.
            A creature without overwhelm resistance is considered to have an overwhelm resistance of 0.

            For example, Felix the fighter has an \glossterm{overwhelm resistance} of 1.
            If he was \glossterm{threatened} by a giant with an \glossterm{overwhelm value} of 2, he would reduce the giant's overwhelm value to 1.
            As a result, Felix would not be overwhelmed.

            \parhead{Ignoring Attackers} At the start of each phase, you can choose to ignore up to one creature threatening you.
            If you do, you are treated as being \unaware against that creature.
            In exchange, it does not contribute to the number of creatures overwhelming you.

        \subsubsection{Range Increments}\label{Range Increments}
            Most physical ranged attacks are less accurate against distant targets.
            This is represented with a \glossterm{range increment} for the attack, which is always measured in feet.
            You take a \minus1 penalty to accuracy with the ranged attack for each full range increment between you and your target.
            For example, when using a longbow with a range increment of 100 feet against a target 170 feet away, you take a \minus1 penalty to accuracy.
            You cannot make a ranged attack beyond 10 range increments away from you.

        \subsubsection{Cover}\label{Cover}

            Cover represents any obstacle that physically prevents you from striking your target, such as a tree or intervening creature.
            A creature behind cover is more difficult to attack.
            There are three kinds of cover: \glossterm{active cover}, \glossterm{passive cover}, and \glossterm{total cover}.
            All three types of cover are determined by the presence or absence of physical obstacles.

            \parhead{Active Cover}\label{Active Cover} Active cover is provided by mobile obstacles between you and your target, such as creatures or tree branches blowing in the wind.
            Physical attacks against creatures with active cover suffer a 20\% miss chance.
            If an attack misses due to active cover, the attack is made against the intervening obstacle rather than being negated like normal for miss chances.
            The obstacle takes any damage from a successful attack normally.

            \parhead{Passive Cover}\label{Passive Cover} Passive cover is provided by immobile obstacles between you and your target, such as trees and walls.
            Creatures with passive cover gain a \plus2 bonus to Armor defense.
            In addition, creatures with passive cover can hide (see \pcref{Stealth}).

            \parhead{Measuring Cover}

            When you make an attack, choose a single square within your \glossterm{space} and a single \glossterm{target square} within your target's space.
            If you are making a ranged attack, choose one corner of your space.
            If you are making a melee attack, choose any two corners of your square.
            These corners are called the \glossterm{points of origin} for your attack.
            For the purpose of determining cover, your attack originates from your chosen \glossterm{points of origin} and travels to the \glossterm{target square}.

            % TODO: pull out ``line of sight'' and ``line of effect'' from this text
            First, check if you can attack the target at all.
            For each \glossterm{point of origin} of your attack, you must be able to draw two lines to any two corners of your attack's \glossterm{target square}.
            These two lines must not overlap each other.
            In addition, each line must not be blocked by solid objects, though they can touch the edges of spaces blocked by solid objects.
            The lines can pass through obstacles that do not take up the entire area within their space (such as most creatures).
            Finally, the line must not be blocked by other squares within the target's space, preventing you from targeting the ``inside'' of large creatures.
            If you cannot draw such a line, the target has \glossterm{total cover} from you.
            This makes all targeted attacks impossible.

            Second, draw a line from the \glossterm{points of origin} of your attack to the center of your attack's target square.
            If any such line touches a square with an obstacle that grants active or passive cover, even at an edge or corner, the target has the appropriate cover from you.
            Otherwise, if the line is uninterrupted, the target does not have cover from you.

            \parhead{Partial Obstacles} Many obstacles, such as trees and low walls, can provide passive cover without normally blocking \glossterm{line of sight} or providing \glossterm{total cover}.
            Unusually small creatures, or creatures who intentionally take cover behind such obstacles, may be able to gain total cover from them.

            \parhead{Improved Cover}
            A creature can benefit from both passive and active cover.
            Cover of the same type generally doesn't stack; a creature behind two trees is not substantially more protected than a creature behind a single tree.
            However, exceptionally well covered creatures, such as a creature behind an arrow slit in a castle, may receive additional benefits.
            In that case, each additional major obstacle increases the miss chance by 10\% or increases the defense bonus by \plus1, as appropriate.

            \parhead{Total Cover}\label{Total Cover}
            If a creature is completely behind an physical object that blocks sight, it has \glossterm{total cover} from attacks.
            A creature with total cover cannot be targeted by any attacks.
            Total cover is the only kind of cover that also affects attacks other than \glossterm{physical attacks}.

        \subsubsection{Concealment}\label{Concealment}
            Concealment represents anything which makes it more difficult to see your target, such as dim lighting.
            A creature with concealment from you gains a \plus2 bonus to Armor defense.
            The concealment bonus does not apply if you can't see your opponent (such as if you close your eyes).
            Determining concealment works similarly to determining cover.
            You must use the same \glossterm{points of origin} and \glossterm{target square} when determining concealment that you would use to determine cover.

            \parhead{Determining Concealment} There are two things that can cause a creature to be concealed: poor lighting, and intervening obstacles that block sight.
            Determining concealment from obstacles that block sight works the same way as determining cover.

            Determining concealment from lighting conditions is simpler, since it ignores lighting conditions between you and the target.
            If your \glossterm{target square} square is in lighting that provides concealment, the target has concealment.
            Otherwise, it does not.

        \subsubsection{Helpless Defenders}
            A helpless creature is completely at an opponent's mercy.
            Its Armor and Reflex defenses are calculated as if it had a Dexterity of \minus10.
            Paralyzed, bound, and unconscious creatures are helpless.
            Any \glossterm{physical attack} against a helpless creature automatically \glossterm{explodes} on the first die.

        \subsubsection{Invisibility}\label{Invisibility}
            If it is impossible to see your target, you can't attack him normally. However, you can attack a square that you think he occupies. An attack into a square occupied by an invisible enemy has a 50\% miss chance. If an adjacent invisible creature strikes you, you can automatically identify the square he occupied when he struck you.

        \subsubsection{Surprise Attacks}\label{Surprise Attacks}
            Sometimes, creatures are not aware that combat is taking place when the combat starts. This most commonly happens with ambushes. Any creature that is not aware of the combat continues taking whatever actions it would normally be taking until it becomes aware of the combat. It is \unaware until that point.

    \subsection{Stacking Rules}\label{Stacking Rules}
        Usually, modifiers stack with each other, meaning that you add or subtract all of the modifiers to get the final result.
        However, some modifiers do not stack with each other, as described below.
        When bonuses don't stack with each other, you only apply the largest bonus.
        Likewise, when penalties don't stack with each ather, you only apply the largest penalty.

        \parhead{Special Exceptions}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Effects from the same source do not stack. Any spell or ability with the same name has the same source.
            \item Magic bonuses do not stack with each other.
            \item If a creature gains the same condition multiple times, the effects do not stack, but each instance of the condition is tracked separately.
                The creature must remove all instances of the condition before the effects are removed.
            \item \glossterm{Sizing} effects do not stack.
                If multiple effects both increase and decrease size, size increases offset size decreases on a one-for-one basis to determine the creature's final size.
            \item Effects that grant extra \glossterm{strikes} (such as the \spell{haste} spell with the Empowered augment) do not stack.
            \item If a character has two separate abilities which let them add the same attribute to a given roll or statistic, the attribute is still only added once.
        \end{itemize}

        \subsubsection{Maximum Bonuses}\label{Ability Limits}
            Some bonuses specify that they cannot increase the value beyond a given point.
            These bonuses must always be applied last, and cannot be combined with other bonuses to exceed the maximum value.
            If multiple bonuses specify different maximum values, use the lower maximum value.
            If a bonus with a maximum value is applied to a value that already exceeds the maximum value the bonus can provide, simply ignore the bonus and its maximum value.

    \subsection{Doubling}\label{Doubling}
        If you double any in-game value twice, it becomes three times as large. An additional doubling would make it four times as large, and so on. For example, if you make an attack that deals double damage and you get a critical hit, you deal triple damage.

        \parhead{Real-World Values} Values that are ``real'', such as movement and distance, are an exception.
        Any real value has a unit that it measures, such as feet.
        Abstract values, such as bonuses and penalties to attacks and checks, do not have units.
        If you double a real-world value twice, it becomes four times as large.

    \subsection{Changing Statistics}

        Your modifiers and defenses can change for many reasons.
        In general, all changes take effect immediately, though some side effects of those changes may not happen until you rest or level up.

        \parhead{Numerical Modifiers} Changes to numerical modifiers always take effect immediately.
        For example, if a barbarian enters a rage, their damage and defenses are all adjusted immediately.

        \parhead{Skill Points} Effects that change a character's skill points take effect immediately.
        However, the character cannot spend additional skill points on new skills until they level up.
        If a character's total skill points are decreased below their currently spent skill points, they immediately lose training from skills until their spent skill points are equal to their total skill points.

        \parhead{Hit Points} Effects that change a character's maximum hit points take effect immediately.
        However, increasing a character's maximum hit points does not immediately grant the character additional hit points.
        They must be recovered in the normal fashion, such as by resting.
        If a character's maximum hit points are decreased below their current hit points, they immediately lose hit points until their current hit points are equal to their maximum hit points.

\section{Movement and Positioning}\label{Movement and Positioning}

    This section describes in more detail how creatures move and position themselves on a battlefield.

    \subsection{Measuring Movement}

        For simplicity, all movement is measured in five-foot increments.
        While it is possible to be more precise than that, it's generally not worth the complexity.

        \parhead{Squares}\label{Squares} Area is commonly measured in 5-ft.\ by 5-ft.\ spaces called \glossterm{squares}.
        A single square represents the area occupied by a single humanoid creature in combat.
        Sometimes, movement and distance are represented by the number of squares travelled.
        A 30-ft.\ movement is the same thing as moving six squares.

        \parhead{Diagonals}\label{Diagonals} When measuring distance, the first diagonal counts as five feet of movement, and the second counds as ten feet of movement.
        The third costs five feet, the fourth costs ten feet, and so on.
        You can move diagonally past corners and enemies.

    \subsection{Movement Abilities}

        Almost all creatures can use these abilities to move around a battlefield.
        Many movement abilities are reactive, allowing you to move automatically in response to the movement of other creatures.
        For example, you can try to follow a creature wherever it goes that round.
        In all cases, if you run out of movement speed before accomplishing your intended task, you simply stop where you ran out of movement.

        The most common types of reactive movements are the \textit{block}, \textit{follow}, and \textit{withdraw} abilities, which are described below.
        However, you can can come up with other reactive movements.
        The only requirement is that a reactive movement must have a simple criteria for determining how you move.

        \parhead{Hustle} As a \glossterm{move action}, you can use the \textit{hustle} ability to move.
        This is the most common movement ability.

        \begin{ability}{Hustle}
            Choose a path that you want to travel.  You travel that path, up to the limit of your movement speed.
        \end{ability}

        \parhead{Block} As a \glossterm{move action}, you can use the \textit{block} ability to prevent a creature from entering a particular area.

        \begin{ability}{\labeltext{Block}}
            Choose a creature to block, and the area you want to block it from entering.
            During the current phase, you automatically move to intercept the target as it approaches the blocked area, up to the limit of your movement speed.
            Usually, blocking a target requires an opposed \glossterm{initiative} check against the target.
            Success means you successfully keep ahead of the target as it moves, preventing it from entering the area (unless it can move through you).
            Failure means the target moves around you (if there is room) to enter the area.

            Multiple creatures can coordinate to block a single creature.
            The blocked creature must beat the initiative of all blocking creatures to enter the blocked area.
        \end{ability}

        \parhead{Follow} As a \glossterm{move action}, you can use the \textit{follow} ability to follow a creature as it moves.

        \begin{ability}{\labeltext{Follow}}
            Choose a creature to follow, and the maximum distance you want to follow at.
            During the current phase, you automatically move such that your distance to the target is no greater than your desired follow distance, up to the limit of your movement speed.
            If the target uses an ability that makes it impossible to follow with movement, such as teleporting, you stop moving when you become adjacent to the position where it used that ability.
        \end{ability}

        \parhead{Withdraw} As a \glossterm{move action}, you can use the \textit{withdraw} ability to keep away from creatures as they move.

        \begin{ability}{\labeltext{Withdraw}}
            This ability functions like the \textit{follow} ability, except that you specify a minimum distance between you and the target instead of a maximum distance.
            In addition, you can specify multiple targets and try to keep away from all of them.
        \end{ability}

        \parhead{Sprint} As a \glossterm{free action}, you can spend an \glossterm{action point} to use the \textit{sprint} ability, allowing you to briefly move more quickly.
        You cannot use this ability twice in the same round.

        \begin{ability}{\labeltext{Sprint}}[\glossterm{Swift}]
            You double your movement speed until the end of the current phase.
        \end{ability}

    \subsection{Movement Impediments}

        \parhead{Difficult Terrain}\label{Difficult Terrain}
        Some terrain is hard to move through, like thick bushes or a swamp.
        If a square is \glossterm{difficult terrain}, it doubles the movement cost required to move out of the square.
        That generally means it takes ten feet of movement, or fifteen feet if you are moving diagonally.

        If a square is considered difficult terrain for multiple reasons, the cost increases stack.
        For example, a square in a swamp that also has thick bushes blocking your passage would take twenty feet of movement, or thirty feet to move diagonally.

        \parhead{Obstacles}
        An obstacle is anything that gets in your way. Enemies and large solid objects like walls completely block your movement. If you can get past an obstacle, like a low wall, that square is treated as difficult terrain. Some obstacles require a \glossterm{check} to bypass, such as an Acrobatics check (see \pcref{Acrobatics}).

        \parhead{Squeezing}\label{Squeezing}
        In some cases, you may have to squeeze into or through an area that isn't as wide as the space you take up.
        You can squeeze through or into a space that is at least half as wide as your normal space.
        While \glossterm{squeezing}, you move half as fast, and you take a \minus2 penalty to \glossterm{accuracy} with \glossterm{strikes} and Armor and Reflex defenses.
        You can squeeze into tighter spaces with the Escape Artist skill.

        Creatures that take up multiple squares take up half their normal number of squares while squeezing. For example, a Large creature who normally takes up four spaces takes up two spaces while squeezing.

        \parhead{Accidentally Squeezing} Sometimes a character ends its movement while moving through a space where it's not normally allowed to stop. When that happens, the character is squeezing in the space until it can move. If squeezing is impossible, the creature immediately moves to the closest available space. Try not to do this.

    \subsection{Movement Modes}\label{Movement Modes}
        A movement mode is a method of moving from one location to another.
        % TODO: terminology confusion mode vs. speed
        The most common movement mode is a land speed.
        In addition, some spells and abilities grant creatures the ability to move in unusual ways.
        These forms of movement are described here.

        \parhead{Burrowing}
        A creature with a burrow speed can move through the ground at the indicated speed in any direction, even vertically. Unless otherwise noted, the creature can only burrow through dirt and loose earth, not rock or harder substances. It does not leave behind a usable tunnel for other creatures.

        \parhead{Climbing}
        A creature with a \glossterm{climb speed} can move a distance equal to its climb speed with a successful Climb check (see \pcref{Climb}).
        In addition, it gains a \plus10 bonus to any Climb checks it makes.

        \parhead{Flying}\label{Flying}
        A creature with a \glossterm{fly speed} can fly through the air at the indicated speed.
        It must not be carrying weight in excess of its maximum carrying capacity (see \pcref{Carrying Capacity}).

        Each creature with a fly speed also has a maneuverability: good, average, poor, or special.
        Unless otherwise specified, a creature with a fly speed has average maneuverability.

        Normally, a flying creature must move forward by at least half its fly speed each round. If it does not, it falls.
        Turning by 90 degrees costs 5 feet of movement, and it can't turn in the same place by more than 90 degrees.
        It can move up by only one square vertically per square traveled horizontally, but it can fly directly down if it chooses.
        The creature can fly up at half speed, but can fly down twice as fast.

        \parhead{Maneuverability}\label{Maneuverability} Some creatures have fly speeds with special maneuverability rules.

        \subparhead{Good Maneuverability} If a creature has good maneuverability while flying, it gains three benefits while flying.
        First, it not need to move forward to maintain its flight, allowing it to hover.
        Second, it can turn in place without spending movement.
        Third, it can move up at the same speed as it moves horizontally.

        \parhead{Poor Maneuverability} If a creature has poor maneuverability while flying, it must spend five feet of movement to turn by 45 degrees, and it can't turn in the same place by more than 45 degrees. In addition, it can only descend by up to one square vertically per square traveled horizontally without falling.

        \parhead{Falling} If a flying creature loses control, usually by failing to maintain its minimum forward speed, or loses the ability to fly, it falls just like any other creature would in midair. As long as it still has the ability to fly, it can regain control of its fall as a standard action, causing it to resume flying normally.

        \parhead{Gliding}\label{Gliding}
        A creature with a glide speed can glide through the air at the indicated speed.

        While in the air, a creature with a glide speed can control its fall as a move action. This allows it to move up to its speed horizontally in a direction of its choice while moving only five feet down. If it desires, it can move half as far horizontally and fall down twice as fast. It takes no falling damage if it touches the ground while gliding.

        \parhead{Land}
        A creature with a land speed can move across the ground at the indicated speed.
        Most creatures have a land speed.

\section{Ability Mechanics}\label{Ability Mechanics}

    \subsection{Targets}\label{Targets}
        Almost all abilities affect targets.
        A target of an ability is a creature directly affected by the ability in some way.
        Many abilities affect targets within a specific \glossterm{range}.

        \subsubsection{Targeted Abilities}\label{Targeted Abilities}
            Some abilities allow you to choose specific targets.
            There can be restrictions on the targets of the ability, such as ``a creature or object'' or ``a willing creature''.
            These abilities are called \glossterm{targeted} abilities.

        \subsubsection{Area Abilities}
            Some abilities affect all valid targets within a given area.
            There can be restrictions on the targets of the ability, such as ``all creatures'' or ``all enemies''.
            However, you cannot individually choose to include or exclude specific targets.
            These abilities are not \glossterm{targeted} abilities.

        \subsubsection{Willing Targets}
            Some abilities can only target willing creatures.
            Creatures choose to be considered willing when abilities choose their targets.
            If a creature chose to be willing at the time when the ability targeted it, the ability will affect that creature even if it decides to be unwilling after that step.

        \subsubsection{Invalid Targets}
            % clarify timing
            You can always attempt to use an ability on an invalid target.
            If the target is still invalid when the ability resolves, the ability automatically fails and has no effect on the target.
            A spell that fails in this way is \glossterm{miscast}.

    \subsection{Range}\label{Range}
        Many abilities can only affect targets or areas within a given \glossterm{range} of you.
        For abilities that affect specific targets, all targets must be within the range.
        For abilities that affect an area within a range, the area's \glossterm{point of origin} must within the range (see \pcref{Point of Origin}).
        There are four common ranges: \rngclose, \rngmed, \rnglong, and \rngext.
        Unless otherwise noted, all abilities with a range require both \glossterm{line of sight} and \glossterm{line of effect} to the point of origin or to all targets.

    \subsection{Line of Sight}\label{Line of Sight}
        Almost all abilities, including \glossterm{strikes}, must have \glossterm{line of sight} to target creatures or objects.
        Unless otherwise noted in an ability's description, you cannot target a creature, object, or location that you do not have line of effect to.

        A line of sight is a straight, unblocked path between you and a target.
        To check if you have line of sight, find a path from any corner of one \glossterm{square} within your \glossterm{space} to any two corners of one \glossterm{square} within the \glossterm{space} of your target.
        If those lines are not blocked by any obstacles that impede sight, you have line of sight to your target.

    \subsection{Line of Effect}\label{Line of Effect}

        Almost all abilities, including \glossterm{strikes}, must have a \glossterm{line of effect} to function.
        Unless otherwise noted in an ability's description, you cannot target a creature, object, or location that you do not have line of effect to.
        In addition, spells that affect an area do not affect targets that the spell does not have line of effect to.

        A line of effect is a straight, unblocked path between you and a target.
        It is identified in the same way as \glossterm{line of sight}, except that it is blocked by physical obstacles instead of obstacles that block sight.
        For example, a pane of glass would block line of effect, but not line of sight.

        \subsubsection{Area Line of Effect}\label{Area Line of Effect}
            Abilities that affect areas normally measure line of effect from the area's \glossterm{point of origin}.
            This can allow you to affect targets that you do not have line of effect to as long as the point of origin has line of effect to both you and the target.

            Areas originating from creatures do not have a single point of origin.
            Instead, line of effect is measured from all grid intersections within or touching the creature's space.
            If any such grid intersection has line of effect to a location, the area as a whole is considered to have line of effect to that location.

        \subsubsection{Destroying Barriers}\label{Destroying Barriers}
            Some abilities deal damage to both creatures and objects.
            If a physical barrier is \glossterm{broken} by an ability, that barrier does not affect the ability's line of effect.
            For example, a thin curtain of silk normally blocks line of effect.
            However, a spell that destroyed the curtain would have its full effect on everything behind the curtain.

        \subsubsection{Inside Creatures}
            Creatures block line of effect to the inside of their own bodies.
            As a result, you cannot cast a spell that takes effect inside a creature unless you are also inside the creature.
            This restriction applies even if there is no physical barrier to the inside of the creature.
            You cannot place \glossterm{point of origin} for an area inside a creature's mouth, even if the creature has its mouth open at the time.

    \subsection{Area}\label{Area}

        Some abilities affect targets within an area.
        All areas have a \glossterm{point of origin}, an area shape, a measurement of their size in feet, and an area type.

        \subsubsection{Point of Origin}\label{Point of Origin}
            When you use an ability that affects an area within a \glossterm{range}, you choose one grid intersection to serve as a starting point for the area.
            This grid intersection is called the \glossterm{point of origin} for the area.
            Areas that originate from a creature do not have a single point of origin.
            % What ambiguity does having multiple points of origin cause?
            For the purpose of effects that care about the area's point of origin, all grid intersections within or touching the creature's space are used.

        \subsubsection{Area Shape}

            \parhead{Cone} A cone extends from the point of origin in a quarter-sphere, up to the given length.

            \parhead{Cylinder} A cylinder extends out from the point of origin in a circle, up to the given radius.
            Cylinders also have a specific height.
            Unless otherwise specified, a cylinder's height is the same as its radius.
            Cylinders ignore obstacles that partially block line of effect, as long as there is a path around the obstacle that lies entirely within the spell's area.

            \parhead{Line} A line extends from the point of origin in a straight line, up to the given length.
            Lines also have a specific width and height.
            Unless otherwise specified, a line-shaped spell affects an area 5 feet wide and 5 feet high.
            The affected squares are chosen such that they stay close to the chosen line as possible.
            All squares affected by a line must be contiguous, so every square is adjacent to another affected square, disregarding diagonals.

            \parhead{Sphere} A sphere extends from the point of origin in all directions.
            Any spell which only specifies a radius for its area is sphere-shaped.

            \parhead{Wall} A wall is like a line, except that it has no width.
            Instead, it affects the boundary between squares.
            Walls can also be shapeable.

            Walls can normally be created within occupied squares, but not within solid objects.
            Some walls are called solid walls, and cannot be created within occupied squares.

            \parhead{Specific Shapes} Some spells specify a series of volumes that make up the area of the spell.
            Most commonly, the volumes are cubes.
            You may arrange the volumes as you want, with the restriction that each volume in the spell's area must be adjacent to one other volume in the spell's area.

        \subsubsection{Area Size}

            The area affected by many spells falls into one of three sizes.
            Each size defines the extent to which the spell extends out from its origin, whether as a radius or as a length.
            Some spells have specific sizes, as given in the spell description.

            \parhead{Small} Small spells extend 10 feet from their point of origin.
            \parhead{Medium} Medium spells extend 20 feet from their point of origin.
            \parhead{Large} Large spells extend 50 feet from their point of origin.

        \subsubsection{Area Types}\label{Area Types}

            \parhead{Burst} A burst spell has an immediate effect on all valid targets within an area.

            \parhead{Emanation} An emanation spell has effects within an area for the duration of the spell.
            It emanates from a specific creature or object, rather than a location.
            If that creature or object moves, the emanation moves with it.

            \parhead{Zone} A zone spell has effects within an area for the duration of the spell.
            Unless otherwise noted, it does not move after being created.


        When casting an area spell, you select the point where the spell originates.
        The point of origin of a spell is always a grid intersection.
        When determining whether a given creature is within the area of a spell, count out the distance from the point of origin in squares just as you do when moving a character or when determining the range for a ranged attack.
        The only difference is that instead of counting from the center of one square to the center of the next, you count from intersection to intersection.

        You can freely decrease a spell's area, provided that you decrease it uniformly across all of the spell's dimensions.
        For example, you can cast a \spell{fireball} that affects a 5 foot radius if you choose to do so, but you can't cast a \spell{fireball} with any shape other than a sphere.

        You can count diagonally across a square, but remember that every second diagonal counts as 2 squares of distance.
        If the far edge of a square is within the spell's area, anything within that square is within the spell's area.
        If the spell's area only touches the near edge of a square, however, anything within that square is unaffected by the spell.

    \subsection{Ability Durations}

        An ability's duration determines how long its effect lasts.
        Abilities can have one of several different kinds of durations.

        \subsection{Conditions}\label{Conditions}
            Many abilities impose \glossterm{conditions} on their targets.
            A condition lasts until it is removed.
            You can remove a condition by taking a \glossterm{short rest} or using the \textit{recover} or \textit{desperate recovery} abilities (see \pcref{Special Combat Abilities}).
            There are several other abilities that can also remove conditions.

        \subsection{Attunement}\label{Attunement}
            Many abilities last as long as a creature \glossterm{attunes} to them.
            Attuning to an ability costs an \glossterm{action point}.
            As long as you are attuned to an ability, you cannot regain the action point spent to attune to that ability.
            In addition, each action point used for attunement reduces the number of action points you recover with a \glossterm{short rest} or \glossterm{long rest} by one.
            You must release your attunement before beginning to rest in order to recover the action points spent to attune to abilities.

            You can choose to stop attuning to an ability as a \glossterm{free action}.
            If you do, the ability's effect ends.

            Attuned abilities continue to work across any distance, but not across planar boundaries.
            At the end of each round, your attunement to all abilities active on a different plane than your current plane ends.
            Planar travel that does not last a full round, such as teleportation, does not interrupt your attunement.

            \subsubsection{Action Point Costs}
                Abilities with the \glossterm{Attune} tag do not cost an \glossterm{action point} to use unless otherwise noted.
                Instead, an action point must be spent to attune to the ability's effect.

            \subsubsection{Attunement Limits}\label{Attunement Limits}
                % TODO: wording
                If you have spent enough action points to attune to abilities that you no longer recover action points with a \glossterm{short rest}, you cannot attune to any additional abilities.
                You must release your attunement to currently active abilities before attuning to new abilities.

            % This name is not great
            \subsubsection{Duplicate Attunement Abilities}\label{Duplicate Attunement Abilities}
                When you use an \glossterm{Attune} (self) or \glossterm{Attune} (target) ability, any previous activations of that ability are immediately \glossterm{dismissed}.
                Any creatures that were attuned to the previous activation of the ability have their attunement released.
                \glossterm{Attune} (ritual) abilities do not have this limitation.
                You may have any number of activations of \glossterm{Attune} (ritual) abilities active at once.

                % What does this even mean? Intended to talk about within-ability choices, I think.
                Minor variations of a single ability are considered to be the same ability for this purpose.
                Applying different \glossterm{augments} to a spell or \glossterm{subspell} does not allow you to attune to it more than once.
                However, you can attune to a spell and any number of different \glossterm{subspells} from that spell.

            \subsubsection{Attunement Types}\label{Attunement Types}
                There are three types of attunement abilities: self, target, and ritual.

                \parhead{Attune (self)} A self attunement ability requires the creature using the ability to attune to the effect.

                \parhead{Attune (target)} A target attunement ability requires the target of the ability to attune to the effect.
                If the ability targets multiple creatures, each creature must attune to the ability independently.

                \parhead{Attune (ritual)} Only \glossterm{rituals} have the \glossterm{Attune} (ritual) tag.
                A ritual attunement ability requires any participant in the ritual to attune to the effect.
                In addition, ritual attunement abilities are not subject to the normal restrictions on multiple attunement.
                % TODO: wording
                You can maintain any number of activations of a particular ritual attunement ability at once.

        \subsection{Sustained Abilities}\label{Sustained Abilities}
            Some abilities last as long as you take an action to sustain them each round.
            The type of action required is always specified in the ability.
            At the end of each round, the ability is dismissed unless you used the ability that round or took the action to sustain the ability that round.
            Sustaining spells does not take concentration, and cannot be disrupted in the same way that casting spells can.

            Taking an action to sustain an ability only allows you to sustain a single use of that ability.
            However, you can sustain multiple separate abilities at once if you have available actions.

            You can only sustain an ability for up to 5 minutes.
            After that time, the ability's effect is \glossterm{dismissed}.

        \subsection{Permanent}
            Some abilities last permanently.
            Such abilities never expire on their own, but can be \glossterm{dismissed} or removed by other abilities appropriately.

        % Is this necessary?
        % Should this clarify interactions with bursts/zones/emanations?
        \subsection{Targeting and Durations}
            If an ability targets creatures or objects directly, the effects travel with the targets for the ability's duration.
            If an ability creates or summons objects or creatures, they last for the duration of the ability, and are capable of moving outside the ability's initial range.
            Such effects can sometimes be destroyed prior to when their duration ends.

    \subsection{Combining Effects}
        Abilities do not generally affect the way another abilities function.
        However, sometimes multiple effects can be in conflict on a creature.
        If one effect makes another effect irrelevant or impossible, the latter effect is ignored.
        If two effects both conflict with each other, the most recent effect takes precedence, and the other is ignored.
        Unless otherwise noted, two different uses of the same ability are always considered to be conflicting with each other.

        All abilities will still have as much of their effect as possible.
        It is possible for an ability to be partially effective in this way.

    \subsection{Suppressing Abilities}\label{Suppressing Abilities}
        Abilities can be \glossterm{suppressed} by effects such as the \spell{thaumaturgy} spell.
        While an ability is suppressed, it has no effect.
        However, if it stops being suppressed, its effects continue as if they had not been interrupted.

    \subsection{Ability Tags}\label{Ability Tags}

        Many spells and other abilities have tags that describe the ability's nature.
        Many of these tags have no game effect by themselves, but they govern how the ability interacts with spells, other abilities, unusual creatures, and so on.
        They are described below.

        \parhead{Acid} Acid abilities use corrosive acid.
        They do not function underwater.

        \parhead{Air} Air abilities control the surrounding air.
        They do not function in environments without air.

        \parhead{Auditory} Auditory abilities use sound to cause their effects.
        Creatures and objects that cannot hear the effect are immune to it.

        \parhead{Cold} Cold abilities use cold \glossterm{energy}. It is possible to freeze liquids and perform similar feats with cold abilities.

        \parhead{Compulsion} Compulsion abilities forcibly alter a creature's actions, but do not necessarily affect its opinions or personality.
        All Compulsion abilities are also \glossterm{Mind} abilities.

        \parhead{Creation} Creation abilities create permanent physical objects.
        Objects created with Creation abilities are identical to objects created through more mundane means.
        Unless otherwise specified, magical Creation abilities do not allow \glossterm{magic resistance}.

        \parhead{Curse} Curse abilities lay supernatural curses on their targets.
        They cannot be \glossterm{dismissed}, but can be removed with the \spell{break enchantment} or \spell{remove curse} spells.

        \parhead{Death} Death abilities only affect living creatures.
        A creature killed by a death effect cannot be returned to life by \spell{resurrection} or similar abilities that depend on an intact corpse.

        \parhead{Emotion} Emotion abilities alter a creature's opinons or personality, but do not necessarily affect their actions.
        All Emotion abilities are also Mind abilities.

        \parhead{Detection} Detection abilities reveal magical auras or information within an area.
        They can penetrate up to 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.
        For its ability to penetrate other materials, use the most similar substance from the list above.

        \parhead{Earth} Earth abilities manipulate the ground or other forms of dirt.
        They do not function if no earth is accessible.

        \parhead{Electricity} Electricity abilities use electrical \glossterm{energy}.

        \parhead{Sensation} Sensation abilities create or manipulate light, sound, or other sensations.
        You can only create sensations you understand.
        For example, you cannot create an illusory figment which speaks coherently in a language you do not understand.
        \par If a Sensation ability appears to create a physical object or creature, its defenses are equal to 0.

        \parhead{Fire} Fire abilities use fire \glossterm{energy}. They do not function underwater.
        \par Fire abilities provide light equivalent to a torch for their duration.
        Abilities without a duration create a brief burst of torchlight.

        \parhead{Flesh} Flesh abilities manipulate the physical flesh of creatures.
        They have no effect on creatures without flesh, such as ghosts or oozes.

        \parhead{Life} Life abilities attack, restore, or manipulate the life force of creatures.
        They have no effect on objects and creatures that are not alive.
        \par Undead creatures are affected in a special way by Life abilities.
        In addition to any differences given in the effect's description, life damage instead heals undead creatures, and healing instead deals life damage.

        \parhead{Light} Light abilities create visible light.
        Their area is blocked by barriers that prevent sight, even if the barriers would not otherwise block effect areas.
        Similarly, their area of effect is not blocked by barriers which do not prevent sight, even if the barriers would normally block effect areas.

        \parhead{Manifestation} Manifestation abilities create temporary constructs formed from raw magical energy.
        Objects and creatures created with manifestation abilities seem real on the surface, but they have no internal structure.
        When an object or creature created by a Manifestation ability is destroyed or killed, or when the duration of the ability that created it ends, it disappears without a trace.
        Unlike \glossterm{Creation} abilities, magical Manifestation abilities allow \glossterm{magic resistance}.

        \parhead{Mind} Mind abilities manipulate the minds of creatures.
        They have no effect on objects or creatures without minds.

        \parhead{Mystic} Mystic abilities alter or destroy magic itself.
        They do not allow \glossterm{magic resistance}.

        \parhead{Physical} Physical abilities manipulate physical objects rather than having a direct magical effect on their targets.
        They do not allow \glossterm{magic resistance}.
        Some abilities are not themselves Physical, but have Physical effects, such as \spell{mighty throw}.

        \parhead{Planar} Planar abilities transport matter or information between planes.

        \parhead{Poison} Poison abilities use substances to weaken the foe's body.

        \parhead{Scrying} Scrying abilities create one or more invisible magical sensors that send you information.
        Unless otherwise noted, the sensor created has the same powers of sensory acuity that you possess.
        This includes the effect of any abilities which target you personally, such as spells to increase your visual acuity, but not abilities which affect an area around you.
        However, the sensor is treated as a separate, independent sensory organ, and it functions normally even if you have been blinded, deafened, or otherwise suffered sensory impairment.
        \par Any creature trained in Spellcraft can notice the sensor by making a DR 20 Spellcraft check.
        The sensor can be dismissed as if it were an active spell.
        You cannot create a sensor in a location with lead sheeting between you and the location, and you sense that the effect is blocked in this way.
        \\

        \parhead{Shaping} Shaping abilities change the shape or structure of their targets.

        \parhead{Shielding} Shielding abilities improve the defenses of their targets.

        \parhead{Sizing} Sizing abilities alter the size of their targets.
        Unless otherwise stated, multiple effects which increase or decrease size do not stack.
        Opposing size modifications cancel each other out on a one for one basis, and any remaining effects occur normally.

        \parhead{Sonic} Sonic abilities use sonic \glossterm{energy}.

        \parhead{Speech} Speech abilities use words to achieve their ends.
        You must specify a language when using a Speech effect, and the language must be one you know (or have memorized the correct words to say). They have no effect on objects or creatures that do not understand the chosen language.

        \parhead{Subtle} Subtle abilities have no visual or otherwise perceivable manifestation.
        Creatures affected by Subtle abilities do not generally know that they are being magically influenced.
        Subtle spells can still be identified with the Spellcraft skill (see \pcref{Spellcraft}), but the DR is 10 higher than normal.

        \parhead{Swift} Swift abilities take effect before other abilities used during the same phase.
        For details, see \pcref{Swift Abilities}.

        \parhead{Teleportation} Teleportation abilities move creature or objects through the Astral Plane to a distant destination.
        A teleported creature can bring along equipment and held objects as long as their weight does not exceed the creature's maximum carrying capacity (see \pcref{Carrying Capacity}). Any excess items are left behind, in order of their distance from the creature's body.

        \parhead{Temporal} Temporal abilities alter the flow of time.

        \parhead{Trap} Trap abilities do not have their full effect immediately.
        All Trap abilities specify a condition or circumstance, such as opening a door, which triggers the full effect of the ability.
        \par Unless otherwise noted, active Trap effects can be detected with the Awareness skill and disabled with the Devices skill before their effect triggers (see \pcref{Awareness}, and \pcref{Devices}).
        The DR to detect and disable the effect is equal to 20 \add the \glossterm{power} of the effect.
        \par No more than one Trap ability can be placed on the same object or in the same area.
        Only the first trap placed has any effect.
        It must be dismissed before any new traps can be placed.

        \parhead{Visual} Visual abilities use visible objects or forces to cause their effects.
        Creatures and objects that cannot see the effect are immune to it.

        \parhead{Water} Water abilities use water to cause their effects.

    \subsection{Damage Types}\label{Damage Types}
        Abilities can deal many kinds of damage.
        The damage types are listed below, along with any special properties that type of damage has.

    \subsection{Magical and Physical Abilities}

        There are two types of abilities: magical abilities and physical abilities.

        \parhead{Magical Abilities}\label{Magical Abilities} A magical ability is an ability that has no physical explanation.
        Examples include spells, a medusa's petrifying gaze, and a cleric's domain invocations.
        Magical attacks often target Fortitude and Mental defenses, and can be resisted by \glossterm{magic resistance}.
        Abilities that are magical in nature are indicated with a (Magical) indicator.
        Abilities that are not magical are \glossterm{mundane}.

        Many abilities which fundamentally concern magical effects are not themselves magical in nature.
        This is most commmon with abilities that represent choices the character makes or knowledge the character has.
        For example, although all spells are magical abilities, the ability to cast spells is not itself a magical ability.
        It is simply knowledge that the creature possesses.
        Of course, that knowledge would be useless if the creature had no access to magic.

        \parhead{Physical Abilities}\label{Physical Abilities} A physical ability has a tangible component and some form of natural explanation.
        Examples include weapon attacks, a dragon's breath weapon, and a barbarian's rage.
        Physical attacks often target Armor defense.
        Unless otherwise indicated, all abilities are physical in nature.
        Abilities that are not physical are \glossterm{magical}.

\section{Universal Abilities}\label{Universal Abilities}
    All creatures can use the following abilities.

    \subsection{Strikes}\label{Strikes}
        A \glossterm{strike} is the most common type of attack.
        There are three kinds of strikes: melee, projectile, and thrown.
        Many abilities allow you to make one or more strikes.
        When you make a strike, you can choose which kind of strike to make.

        All strikes are \glossterm{mundane} abilities.
        Your \glossterm{accuracy} with a strike is equal to your normal accuracy (see \pcref{Accuracy}).
        Your \glossterm{damage} with a strike is determined by your \glossterm{mundane power} and the weapon you hit with (see \pcref{Strike Damage}).

        \parhead{Two-Weapon Strikes}\label{Two-Weapon Strikes}
        All strike abilities require a \glossterm{standard action} and allow you to attack with either one or two weapons.
        If you make a strike with two weapons, you take a \minus1 penalty to \glossterm{accuracy} with both attacks for each non-light weapon you attack with.

        \begin{ability}{\labeltext{Melee Strike}}
            Choose a creature you \glossterm{threaten} and one or two \glossterm{melee weapons} that you can attack with.
            For each weapon, make a \glossterm{physical attack} with that weapon against the Armor defense of the target.

            On a hit with any weapon, the target takes damage from one weapon you hit with (see \pcref{Strike Damage}).
            On a critical hit with any weapon, the target takes double damage from one weapon you hit with.
        \end{ability}

        \begin{ability}{\labeltext{Projectile Strike}}
            Choose a creature you can target and one or two \glossterm{projectile} weapons you can attack with, and a creature you can see.
            The creature must be within ten \glossterm{range increments} of you with all weapons.
            For each weapon, make a \glossterm{physical attack} with that weapon against the Armor defense of the target.
            The attack takes a \minus1 penalty to \glossterm{accuracy} for for each full range increment between you and the target with that weapon.

            On a hit with any weapon, the target takes damage from one weapon you hit with (see \pcref{Strike Damage}).
            On a critical hit with any weapon, the target takes double damage from one weapon you hit with.
        \end{ability}

        \begin{ability}{\labeltext{Thrown Strike}}
            Choose a creature you can target and one or two \glossterm{thrown weapons} you can attack with.
            The creature must be within five \glossterm{range increments} of you with all of the weapons.
            For each weapon, make a \glossterm{physical attack} with that weapon against the Armor defense of the target.
            The attack takes a \minus1 penalty to \glossterm{accuracy} for for each full range increment between you and the target with that weapon.

            On a hit with any weapon, the target takes damage from one weapon you hit with (see \pcref{Strike Damage}).
            On a critical hit with any weapon, the target takes double damage from one weapon you hit with.
        \end{ability}

            1. This ability costs an \glossterm{action point} to use.
        \end{dtable}

        \parhead{Charge} As a standard action during the \glossterm{action phase}, you can spend an \glossterm{action point} to use the \textit{charge} ability.

        \begin{ability}{\labeltext{Charge}}
            Move up to your speed in a single straight line.
            During the \glossterm{delayed action phase}, you can make a melee \glossterm{strike} from your new location.
        \end{ability}

        \parhead{Desperate Recovery} As a standard action, you can use the \textit{desperate recovery} ability to remove a \glossterm{condition} from yourself.
        As long as you are conscious, no effect can prevent you from using this ability, even effects that prohibit using any other abilities.

        \begin{ability}{\labeltext{Desperate Recovery}}
            At the end of the round, if you did not take damage this round, you may remove one \glossterm{condition} affecting you.
            This cannot remove a condition applied during the current round.
        \end{ability}

        \parhead{Dirty Trick} As a standard action, you can use the \textit{dirty trick} ability to creatively impair a foe's ability to fight.

        \begin{ability}{Dirty Trick}\label{Dirty Trick}
            When you use this ability, you must describe the kind of dirty trick you are performing.
            For example, you can pull a creature's pants down, throw sand, or otherwise use your environment to attack.

            Make a melee \glossterm{physical attack} with a free hand against the Fortitude or Reflex defense of a creature you \glossterm{threaten}.
            The target uses whichever defense is appropriate to the nature of the trick you describe.

            On a hit, as a \glossterm{condition}, the target suffers a \minus2 penalty to one of the following statistics:
                \glossterm{accuracy} with \glossterm{physical attacks}, Armor defense, Fortitude defense, Reflex defense, or Mental defense.
        \end{ability}

        \parhead{Disarm} As a standard action, you can use the \textit{disarm} ability to knock an item out of a foe's hands.

        \begin{ability}{Disarm}\label{Disarm}
            Make a melee \glossterm{strike} with a weapon you wield against an object.
            Unlike most abilities, this ability can target specific items \glossterm{attended} by creatures.
            This attack must beat the target's Armor defense.
            If the target is attended by a creature, the attack must also beat the attending creature's Reflex defense.

            On a hit, you choose whether the target takes damage from the weapon you hit it with.
            In addition, if the target is \glossterm{attended} and is not held in two hands or well secured (such as a ring), you can choose to knock it loose.
            If you do, it falls to the ground in the square occupied by the attending creature that is closest to you.
        \end{ability}

        \parhead{Feint} As a standard action during the \glossterm{action phase}, you can use the \textit{feint} ability to distract an opponent, allowing you to strike them more accurately.

        \begin{ability}{Feint}\label{Feint}
            Make a melee \glossterm{physical attack} with a weapon you wield against a creature's Reflex defense.
            During the \glossterm{delayed action phase}, you can also make a melee \glossterm{strike} with the same weapon.

            On a hit, the target takes a \minus2 penalty to defenses against the delayed strike.
            On a miss, you take a \minus2 penalty to accuracy with the strike.
        \end{ability}

        \parhead{Grapple} As a standard action, you can use the \textit{grapple} ability to physically grab and restrain a creature.

        \begin{ability}{Grapple}\label{Grapple}
            Make a melee \glossterm{physical attack} with a free hand against a creature's Fortitude and Reflex defenses.

            On a hit against both defenses, you and the target are \grappled by each other.
            For details, see \pcref{Grappling}.
        \end{ability}

        \parhead{Recover} As a \glossterm{minor action}, you can spend an \glossterm{action point} to use the \textit{recover} ability.
        As long as you are conscious, no effect can prevent you from using this ability, even effects that prohibit using any other abilities.
        \begin{ability}{\labeltext{Recover}}
            You may remove one \glossterm{condition} affecting you.
            This cannot remove a condition applied during the current round.
        \end{ability}

        \parhead{Shove} As a standard action, you can use the \textit{shove} ability to physically move a creature.

        \begin{ability}{Shove}\label{Shove}
            Make a melee \glossterm{physical attack} with a free hand against a creature's Fortitude defense.
            For each size category larger or smaller than the target that you are, you gain a \plus4 bonus or penalty to \glossterm{accuracy}.

            On a hit, you move the target up to 10 feet in a direction of your choice.
            Effects that limit movement speed, such as \glossterm{difficult terrain}, similarly limit the distance you can move the target.
            You can move the same distance that you push the target.
            You cannot normally keep moving the target if it stops being adjacent to you.
            If the target encounters a creature or solid object, you must stop moving it.
        \end{ability}

        \parhead{Total Defense} As a standard action, you can use the \textit{total defense} ability to focus entirely on defending yourself.

        \begin{ability}{\labeltext{Total Defense}}[\glossterm{Swift}]
            You gain a \plus2 bonus to your \glossterm{defenses} until the end of the round.
        \end{ability}

        \parhead{Trip} As a standard action, you can use the \textit{trip} ability to trip a creature.

        \begin{ability}{\labeltext{Trip}}
            Make a melee \glossterm{physical attack} with a free hand against a creature's Fortitude and Reflex defenses.

            On a hit, the target becomes \prone.
        \end{ability}

    \subsection{Special Movement Abilities}

        \parhead{Struggle} As a standard action, you can use the \textit{struggle} ability to move despite movement impediments.

        \begin{ability}{\labeltext{Struggle}}
            Until the end of the current phase, your land speed becomes five feet, regardless of all other effects that would modify your land speed.
            In addition, you can move a distance up to your land speed.
            This does not allow you to pass obstacles unrelated to movement speed penalties, such as walls.
        \end{ability}

        \parhead{Overrun} At the start of each phase, you can spend an \glossterm{action point} to use the \textit{overrun} ability.

        \begin{ability}{\labeltext{Overrun}}
            You can try to move directly through creatures in your way during the current phase.
            Each creature in your way can choose to avoid you, allowing you to pass through its square unhindered.
            If a creature does not attempt to avoid you, you make an attack vs. Fortitude against it.
            Your \glossterm{accuracy} is equal to your Strength.

            On a hit, you can move through the creature's space, though you treat it as \glossterm{difficult terrain}.
            On a critical hit, the creature is also knocked prone, and you do not treat its space as difficult terrain.
            On a miss, you end your movement immediately.
        \end{ability}

\section{Injury, Death, and Healing}\label{Injury, Death, and Healing}

    \subsection{Hit Points}\label{Hit Points}
        Your hit points measure how hard you are to kill.
        When you take damage, you subtract that damage from your hit points.
        No matter how many hit points you lose, you aren't significantly hindered until your hit points drop to 0.
        When you run out of hit points, your actions are limited and you might die.
        You can't normally exceed your maximum hit points, even with magical healing.

        Your hit points are calculated as follows:

        \begin{figure}[h]
            \centering (Level \add 1) \x (5 \add starting Constitution)
        \end{figure}

        \parhead{What Hit Points Represent} Hit points represent a combination of durability, luck, divine providence, and sheer determination, depending on the nature of the creature being damaged.
        When you take 10 damage from an orc with a greataxe, the axe did not literally carve into your skin without affecting your ability to fight.
        Instead, you avoided the worst of the blow, but it bruised you through your armor, the effort to dodge the blow fatigued you, or it barely nicked you through sheer luck -- and everyone's luck runs out eventually.

    \subsection{Vital Damage}\label{Vital Damage}
        When you take damage in excess of your hit points while \glossterm{wounded}, that damage represents serious physical injury to your body.
        This is called \glossterm{vital damage}.
        For every 4 points of \glossterm{vital damage} you have, you take a \minus1 penalty to \glossterm{accuracy}, \glossterm{checks}, and \glossterm{defenses}.

        \parhead{Healing Vital Damage} Vital damage is much more difficult to heal than lost hit points.
        Vital damage can only be healed by taking a \glossterm{long rest} or with special abilities (see \pcref{Long Rest}).
        Abilities that heal hit points cannot heal vital damage unless they explicitly say they can.

    \subsection{Overkill Damage}\label{Overkill Damage}
        Normally, when you take damage that would reduce your hit points to 0, any excess damage from the attack is wasted.
        However, some attacks deal such massive damage that you begin dying immediately, rather than just losing all of your hit points.
        If you take damage in excess of your \glossterm{bloodied} hit point total in a single round, any damage past what would reduce your hit points to 0 is dealt as \glossterm{vital damage}.

    \subsection{Stages of Injury}

        \parhead{Healthy} When you are above half hit points, you suffer no significant effects from losing hit points.
        If you take damage, you can become bloodied (see Bloodied, below).

        \parhead{Bloodied} At the end of each phase, if you are at half your hit points or below, you become \glossterm{bloodied}.
        A bloodied creature takes a \minus4 penalty to Fortitude and Mental defense.
        If you end a phase with more than half your hit points, you stop being bloodied.
        Becoming bloodied can also make you \glossterm{staggered}, as described below.

        \parhead{Staggered}\label{Staggered}
        The first time you become \glossterm{bloodied} in an encounter, you become \glossterm{staggered} until the end of the same phase in the next round.
        For example, if you become bloodied at the end of the \glossterm{action phase}, you would be \glossterm{staggered} until the end of the action phase in the next round.
        A staggered creature takes a \minus4 penalty to \glossterm{accuracy} and \glossterm{checks}.

        \parhead{Wounded}\label{Wounded} At the end of each round, if you have no hit points remaining, you become \wounded.
        In addition, you are wounded if you have any \glossterm{vital damage}.
        A wounded creature suffers no immediate ill effects.
        However, it becomes vulnerable to taking \glossterm{vital damage} (see \pcref{Vital Damage}).
        If you take vital damage, you can begin dying (see Dying, below).

        At the end of each round, if you have hit points remaining and do not have any \glossterm{vital damage}, you stop being wounded.

        \parhead{Dying}\label{Dying} At the end of each round, if you have \glossterm{vital damage} and have no hit points remaining, you begin \glossterm{dying}.
        While you are dying, you must make an attack against your own Fortitude defense at the end of every round.
        This is called a \glossterm{stabilization roll}.
        No bonuses or penalties apply to the attack roll, but \glossterm{vital damage} and other effects can penalize your Fortitude defense.
        If you fail to resist the attack once, you fall unconscious.
        If you fail to resist the attack three times, you die.
        If you resist the attack three times, you stabilize.
        When you stabilize, you no longer need to make attacks against yourself each round, and any failures that brought you closer to death are negated.
        If you take additional \glossterm{vital damage} while dying, any successes you rolled to resist death are negated, but any failures remain unchanged.

        An ally can make a Heal check to tend to you while you are dying.
        The Heal check result can be used in place of your Fortitude defense.
        However, any \glossterm{vital damage penalties} you suffer apply to the Heal check in the same way that they apply to your Fortitude defense.

    \subsection{Subdual Damage}\label{Subdual Damage}
        Some attacks and environmental effects deal subdual damage.
        Subdual damage works in the same way as normal damage, except that it cannot turn into \glossterm{vital damage}.
        Instead, if you deal subdual damage to a \glossterm{wounded} creature, it immediately falls unconscious.


% TODO: This is a bad name; organize these better
\section{Special Rules}
    \subsection{Encumbrance}\label{Encumbrance}
        Your encumbrance is a value that represents how much you are burdened by armor and weight.
        You apply your encumbrance as a penalty to all Strength and Dexterity-based checks you make.
        You can increase your encumbrance by wearing armor or by carrying an excessive weight (see \pcref{Carrying Capacity}).
        In addition, you reduce your encumbrance by amount equal to your starting Constitution.

        In addition, sleeping in armor is difficult.
        % ``have any encumbrance'' is awkward - worth introducing ``encumbered''?
        If you sleep while you have any encumbrance, you become \glossterm{fatigued} when you wake up.


    \subsection{Grappling}\label{Grappling}
        A grappled creature is physically struggling with at least one other creature.
        While grappled, you suffer certain penalties and restrictions, as described below.

        \subsubsection{Being In A Grapple}
            While grappling, you suffer certain penalties and restrictions, as described below. Other than these restrictions, you can act normally. You can also take certain actions in a grapple, as described in \pcref{Grapple Actions}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item You must use a free hand (or equivalent limbs) to grapple, preventing you from taking any actions which would require having two free hands.
                    If you cannot free a hand, you suffer a \minus10 penalty to accuracy on all \glossterm{physical attacks} until you have a free hand.
                \item You take a \minus4 penalty to accuracy with weapons that are not \glossterm{light weapons}, since they are too large and cumbersome to be used effectively in a grapple.
                \item Spellcasting is extremely difficult. You cannot cast spells with somatic components.
                    Casting a spell without somatic components requires a \glossterm{concentration} check with a DR equal to 20 \add double spell level.
                \item You cannot normally move from your location (but see the \textit{move grapple} ability, below).
            \end{itemize}

        \subsubsection{Grapple Actions}\label{Grapple Actions}
            While grappled, you can use four special abilities to try to affect the grapple.
            For all grapple actions, you can use your Strength in place of your Perception to determine your \glossterm{accuracy}.

            \parhead{Bind Foe} As a standard action, you can use the \textit{bind foe} ability to bind a foe you are grappling in restraints.

            \begin{ability}{Bind Foe}
                You must have physical restraints, such as rope, in hand to use this ability (in addition to the free hand required to grapple).

                Make an attack vs. Fortitude and Reflex against a creature who is grappled by you.
                If you have the time, you can \glossterm{take 10} on this attack to secure bindings on a helpless foe, including a foe rendered helpless through this attack.

                \hit The target is bound, rendering it \glossterm{helpless} and effectively \glossterm{paralyzed}.
                % TODO: clarify how to escape/break bindings?
                The only physical actions a bound creature can take are to escape or break the bindings.
                Escaping the bindings requires a \glossterm{physical attack} or Escape Artist check which beats the attack result made to bind the creature.
                Breaking the bindings requires making a Strength check sufficient to break the item used to bind the creature.
            \end{ability}

            \parhead{Escape Grapple} As a standard action, you can use the \textit{escape grapple} ability to try to stop being grappled.

            \begin{ability}{Escape Grapple}
                Make an attack vs. Reflex against every creature that you are grappled by.

                % TODO: awkward wording
                \hit You are not grappled by each target, and each target is not grappled by you.
            \end{ability}

            \parhead{Move Grapple} As a \glossterm{move action}, you can use the \textit{move grapple} ability to move yourself and all creatures you are grappling with.

            \begin{ability}{Move Grapple}
                Make an attack vs. Fortitude against every creature grappled by you.
                If a target also uses this ability to affect you during the same phase, you compare your attack result against its attack result instead of against its Fortitude defense.

                % how to word ``hit or beat''?
                If you hit every target or beat every target's attack result, you can move yourself and all other creatures grappled by you a distance up to half your speed.
            \end{ability}

            \parhead{Pin} As a standard action, you can use the \textit{pin} ability to further restrict the actions of a creature you are grappling with.

            \begin{ability}{Pin}
                Make an attack vs. Fortitude and Reflex against a creature who is grappled by you.
                This ability requires two free hands to use.

                \hit The target is completely immobile as long as you use two free hands to hold it still.
                The only physical action the target can take is the \textit{escape grapple} ability (see above), though it can take mental actions.
                At your discretion, you can cover the mouth of a pinned creature to prevent it from speaking.
                You may release the target as a \glossterm{free action}, ending this effect.
            \end{ability}

        \subsubsection{Asymmetric Grappling}\label{Asymmetric Grappling}
            Normally, when you use the \textit{grapple} ability, both you and the target become grappled by each other.
            Some abilities allow you to grapple other creatures without becoming grappled yourself.
            You can release a creature that you are not grappled by as a \glossterm{free action}.
            If you do, the creatures stops being grappled by you.

    \subsection{Unarmed Combat}\label{Unarmed Combat}
        Every creature can attack with its body using an unarmed attack.
        You are not proficient with your unarmed attack, so you are usually \defenseless while unarmed.
        In addition, an unarmed attack always deals \glossterm{subdual damage}.
        You may use any appropriate part of your body to make an unarmed attack -- fists, feet, elbows, and so on.
        However, you only have one unarmed attack.
        You cannot dual-wield unarmed attacks as if you were fighting with two weapons at once (see \pcref{Strikes}).

        An unarmed attack is a type of natural weapon.
        Spells and abilities that affect natural weapons can affect your unarmed attack.
        Gauntlets can also be worn to increase the power of an unarmed attack (see \pcref{Unarmed Weapons}).

    \subsection{Mounted Combat}\label{Mounted Combat}
        \parhead{Horses in Combat} Warhorses and warponies can serve readily as combat steeds. Light horses, ponies, and heavy horses, however, are frightened by combat.
        At the start of each round, you must make a DR 10 Ride check to control such a horse.
        Success means you can act normally that round, directing the horse's movements as if it was trained for combat.
        Failure means that the horse acts of its own volition that round, usually fleeing in panic.

        \parhead{Space} A horse (not a pony) is a Large creature, and thus takes up a space 10 feet (2 squares) across. While mounted, you share your mount's space completely. Anyone threatening your mount can attack either you or your mount. However, your reach is still that of a creature of your normal size. Thus, a Medium paladin would threaten all squares adjacent to his Large horse with a longsword, and all squares 10 feet away from his mount with a lance.

        In the case of abnormally large mounts (two or more size categories larger than you), you may not completely share space. Such situations should be handled on a case-by-case basis, depending on the nature of the mount.

        \parhead{Combat while Mounted} With a DR 5 Ride check, you can guide your mount with your knees so as to use both hands to attack or defend yourself. This is a free action.

        If your mount is moving in the current phase, you gain a \plus1d bonus to damage with Mounted weapons (see \pcref{Mounted Weapon}).
        You also take a \minus2 penalty to accuracy with ranged strikes.
        If your mount uses the \textit{sprint} ability, this penalty increases to \minus4 (see \pcref{Sprint}).

        \parhead{Casting Spells while Mounted} You can cast a spell normally if your mount only moves during the \glossterm{movement phase}.
        If you have your mount move during the same \glossterm{phase} that you cast a spell, you have to make a \glossterm{concentration} check due to the vigorous motion (DR 5 \add double spell level) to avoid \glossterm{miscasting} the spell.
        If the mount uses the \textit{sprint} ability during that phase, you take a \minus2 penalty to the check due to the violent motion.

        \parhead{If Your Mount Falls in Battle} If your mount falls, you fall to the ground with it.

        \parhead{If You Are Dropped} If you are knocked unconscious, you fall from your mount to the ground, which may cause you to take \glossterm{falling damage}.
        If you have a military saddle, you stay on your mount instead.
        In either case, the mount acts according to its nature.
        Most mounts flee combat without a rider.

    \subsection{Drowning}\label{Drowning}
        You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to 5 \add your Constitution.
        After that time, you must roll 1d10.
        This attack gains a \plus5 bonus for each round you hold your breath beyond your limit.
        If the result exceeds your Fortitude defense, you take \glossterm{vital damage} equal to the difference.

    \subsection{Damage Reduction}\label{Damage Reduction}
        Some abilities can give you \glossterm{damage reduction}.
        Each \glossterm{round}, you ignore the first points of damage you would take.
        Damage reduction always specifies an amount of damage it reduces.
        Once it reduces that much damage, it stops functioning until the start of the next round.

    \subsection{Hardness}\label{Hardness}
        Almost all objects have a \glossterm{hardness} that indicates how durable they are.
        In addition, some creatures have a hardness as well.
        When a creature or object with hardness would take damage, if the hardness of the attacking object or creature lower than the hardness of the defender, the attacking object or creature takes the damage instead.
        For example, if you try to break a stone wall with a wooden club, the club will break instead of the wall.
        % TODO: define hardness for creatures and their natural weapons; natural weapons should generally have higher hardness than creatures to avoid hardness reflection being common

    \subsection{Magic Resistance}\label{Magic Resistance}
        Some abilities can give you \glossterm{magic resistance}.
        Magic resistance is an additional defense against \glossterm{magical} abilities such as spells.
        To affect a creature that has magic resistance with a magical ability, you must make an additional attack against the creature's magic resistance.
        Your accuracy is equal to your \glossterm{power} with the ability you using.
        If your attack result beats the creature's magic resistance, the ability works normally.
        Otherwise, the ability has no effect on the creature.

        Magic resistance does not prevent a magical ability from having its normal effect on other creatures or objects.
        Magical abilities which do not directly affect targets, such as the \spell{summon monster} spell, do not allow magic resistance.
        In addition, \glossterm{Mystic} and \glossterm{Physical} abilities do not allow magic resistance (see \pcref{Ability Tags}).

        % Clarify how you know which abilities to allow through
        Normally, creatures with magic resistance can choose to allow abilities through their resistance.
        This choice is made when the ability targets the creature.
        Some creatures cannot control their magic resistance, so an attack is always necessary to affect them.
        This is specified in the description of the creature's magic resistance.

    \subsection{Action Points}\label{Action Points}
        You can perform a wide variety of special actions by spending \glossterm{action points}.
        You normally have six action points.
        You gain a bonus or penalty to the number of action points you have equal to your starting Willpower, and some abilities can grant you additional action points.

        After a \glossterm{short rest}, you regain all action points you spent since your last rest, up to a maximum equal to half of your maximum action points.
        After a \glossterm{long rest}, you recover all spent action points.

    \subsection{Resting}
        When you have a moment to relax, you can rest to regain some of your expended abilities.
        There are two main types of rests: a \glossterm{short rest} and a \glossterm{long rest}.

        \subsubsection{Short Rest}\label{Short Rest}
            Resting for five minutes is considered a \glossterm{short rest}.
            When you take a short rest, you gain the following benefits.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item You heal hit points equal to half your maximum hit points.
                    The Heal skill can increase this healing (see \pcref{Accelerate Recovery}).
                \item You regain all action points you spent since your last rest, up to a maximum equal to half of your maximum action points.
                    Being \glossterm{attuned} to effects at the start of your rest can reduce the number of action points you recover in this way (see \pcref{Attunement}).
                \item You remove all \glossterm{conditions} affecting you (unless they cannot be removed normally).
                \item Some other abilities have specific effects that last until you take a short rest.
                    For example, a barbarian cannot use their \textit{rage} ability again after raging until after they take a short rest (see Rage, page \pref{Bbn:Rage}).
            \end{itemize}

        \subsubsection{Long Rest}\label{Long Rest}
            Resting for eight hours is considered a \glossterm{long rest}.
            When you take a long rest, you gain the following benefits.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item You heal vital damage equal to your starting Constitution \add half your level, to a minimum of 1 vital damage.
                    The Heal skill can increase this healing (see \pcref{Accelerate Recovery}).
                \item You regain all spent \glossterm{action points}.
                    Being \glossterm{attuned} to effects at the start of your rest can reduce the number of action points you recover in this way (see \pcref{Attunement}).
                \item You regain all spent \glossterm{legend points}.
                \item You regain all spent \glossterm{item slots}.
                \item Some other abilities have specific effects that last until you take a long rest.
            \end{itemize}

\section{Legend Points}\label{Legend Points}
    At 3rd level, you gain a limited ability to change your fate with \glossterm{legend points}.
    When you unexpectedly fail at a critical moment, or an enemy delivers a particularly devastating blow, you can spend a \glossterm{legend point} to shift the outcome of the situation in your favor.

    \subsubsection{Using Legend Points}
        You can use a legend point to automatically roll a 10 on any \glossterm{attack} or \glossterm{check} you make.
        On attack rolls, this allows you to roll again, just as if you had rolled a 10 normally (see \pcref{Exploding Attacks}).
        Alternately, you can use a legend point to make any \glossterm{attack} or \glossterm{check} against you roll a 1.

        Using a legend point is not an action, and can be done at any time.
        You can decide to use a legend point after you learn whether the original roll succeeded or failed.
        You can even use a legend point after you learn what the effects of a successful attack or check would be, if that is information you could normally learn if it succeeded.
        However, you must use the legend point before the phase is over.

        If you use a legend point defensively against an attack affects multiple targets, your legend point only affects the roll against you, and does not change the attack's effects against the other targets.

    \subsubsection{Gaining Legend Points}
        At the start of each session of gameplay, you gain one legend point if you would otherwise have no legend points.
        In addition, on rare occasions you can gain legend points by performing extraordinary deeds worthy of legends.
        In unusually long gameplay sessions, you may recover a legend point at an appropriate resting point if you have no legend points.

    \subsubsection{Legendary Foes}
        A small number of legendary enemies you encounter may have their own legend points.

\section{Character Advancement}\label{Character Advancement}

    As you accomplish challenges and defeats foes, you gain experience.
    If you have enough experience, you gain a level.
    When you gain a level, you may gain new abilities from your class and the feats you have chosen.
    You also gain some abilities at specific levels, as described in \trefnp{Character Advancement}.

    A character that increases in level gains additional benefits.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item At 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th level, you gain an \glossterm{item slot}.
        \item At 2nd, 5th, and 9th level, you gain a feat (see \pcref{Feats}).
        \item At 3rd level, you gain access to \glossterm{legend points}.
        \item At 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a \glossterm{legacy item} upgrade (see \pcref{Legacy Items}).
    \end{itemize}

        3. You gain access to \glossterm{legend points} at this level.
    \end{dtable}

    \subsection{Increasing Attributes}
        As your level increases, your attributes increase as well, as shown on \trefnp{Increasing Attributes with Level}.

        \begin{dtable}
            \lcaption{Increasing Attributes with Level}
            \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{X X}

            \end{dtabularx}
        \end{dtable}

    \subsection{Determining Attributes}
        There are several options for how to determine attribute scores.

        \subsubsection{Predefined Attribute Scores} This is the simplest method.
        Simply take the following set of attribute scores and distribute them as you choose among your attributes:

        3, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0

        This set of attribute scores is called the ``elite array''.
        For more extreme characters, you may use the ``savant array'':

        4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0.

        Finally, for more well-balanced characters, you may use the ``balanced array'':

        2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0

        Any of these distributions can be altered by taking penalties to any attributes given as 0.
        For each penalty you take, you gain two additional \glossterm{skill points} (see \pcref{Skills}).

        \subsubsection{Point Buy}
            With this method, you can fully control your attribute scores to match what you want to be able to do.
            All your attribute scores start at 0.
            You get ten points to distribute among your attributes.
            Attributes can be bought according to the costs on \trefnp{Attribute Score Point Costs}.
            The listed cost is the total cost required to gain the listed starting attribute.
            You are 1st level when you start, which adds appropriately to your total attribute score.

            \parhead{Impaired Attributes}\label{Impaired Attributes}
            You can start with up to two attributes below 0.
            If you do, you compensate for your impairment in that area with additional talents in other areas.
            For each point below 0, you gain an additional \glossterm{skill point}.
            Decreasing your attributes below 0 does not grant you additional points to spend on other attributes.

            \begin{dtable}
                \lcaption{Attribute Score Point Costs}
                \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{X X l}
                    \tb{Starting Attribute Score} & \tb{Total Attribute Score} & \tb{Cumulative Point Cost} \\
                    \bottomrule
                    \minus2\fn{1}                 & \minus2                    & 0\fn{2}                    \\
                    \minus1\fn{1}                 & \minus1                    & 0\fn{3}                    \\
                    0                             & 0                          & 0                          \\
                    1                             & 1 \add half level          & 1                          \\
                    2                             & 1 \add level               & 3                          \\
                    3                             & 2 \add level               & 5                          \\
                    4                             & 3 \add level               & 7                          \\
                \end{dtabularx}
                1 You cannot reduce more than two attributes below 0 in this way. \\
                2 You gain a total of four \glossterm{skill points}. \\
                3 You gain two skill points. \\
            \end{dtable}

        \subsubsection{Extraordinary Attributes}
            Some abilities can increase your starting attributes above 4.
            For each point of starting attribute beyond 4, you increase your current attribute by the same amount.

            For example, a 20th level half-orc cleric with the Strength domain who spent 7 points on her starting Strength would have a total starting Strength of 6.
            Her Strength would be two higher than it would be with a starting attribute of 4, for a total of 25.
