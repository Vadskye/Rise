\glossdef{character level} Your character level is your total level, including levels from all of your classes.
Whenever text refers to your ``level'', without specifying a particular kind of level, it means your character level.

\glossdef{chain} An ability can specify that it chains a certain number of times.
For each time that the spell chains, you may choose an additional secondary target for the spell.
Each additional target must be within 15 feet of the previous target in the chain, starting with the spell's primary target.
These additional targets must have \glossterm{line of sight} to you and \glossterm{line of effect} to the previous target in the chain.
However, they do not need \glossterm{line of effect} to you, and they can be beyond the ability's original range.

Unless otherwise noted in a spell's description, the secondary targets from chaining are affected by the ability in the exact same way as the primary target.
Both creatures and objects are valid targets for chaining, but they have to be reasonably sized.
You can't chain off of the ground.

First, they cost extra \glossterm{attunement point} to \glossterm{attune} to.
Second, you can't get back those attunement points until you take a \glossterm{short rest}, even if you release the attunement.
For details, see \pcref{Deep Attunement}.

\glossdef{defeat} You defeat a creature if you personally cause it to become \glossterm{defeated}.
Abilities that trigger when you defeat a creature generally activate if you deal damage to it in a phase when it dies or is knocked unconscious.
This often means multiple creatures are considered to have defeated the same enemy.
For narrative purposes, you can choose to give credit to the creature who dealt the most damage in the last phase, but you shouldn't use that method for determining whether creatures gain the benefit of effects like an \mitem{onslaught} weapon.

\glossdef{defeated} A creature is defeated if it dies, surrenders or is incapacitated for an extended period of time (such as by being knocked unconscious).
Some abilities, such as a ranger's \textit{quarry} ability (see \pcref{Quarry}), last until their target is defeated.
If there is ambiguity about whether a surrendering or seemingly incapacitated enemy still poses a threat, you choose whether you consider the enemy to be defeated.

\glossdef{environmental damage}[environmental] Environmental damage is a type of damage.
Environmental damage does not reduce the \glossterm{damage resistance} of creatures or objects, making small amounts of environmental damage irrelevant to healthy creatures.
For details, see \pcref{Environmental Damage}.

\glossdef{exotic weapon}[exotic weapons] A rare few weapons are considered exotic weapons.
They are unusually difficult to wield, and even being \glossterm{proficient} with the associated \glossterm{weapon group} does not grant you the ability to use an exotic ewapon.
Some class abilities grant proficiency with exotic weapons.

\glossdef{explode}[explosions] When you roll a 10 on an \glossterm{attack roll}, the die can explode.
If it does, you roll it again and add the two results together to determine the total.

They are less common than a miss chance, and reflect circumstances that no amount of skill can mitigate.

\glossdef{falling damage} If you fall at least 5 feet, you and the object you land on take bludgeoning \glossterm{environmental damage}.
This damage is called falling damage, and it is equal to 1d10 per 10 feet you fell, up to a maximum of 20d10 damage.

When your fatigue penalty reaches \minus5, you fall \unconscious until your fatigue penalty is reduced below \minus5.
For details, see \pcref{Fatigue Penalty}.

\glossdef{forced movement} A forced movement ability can cause a creature to move unwillingly.
There are two types of forced movement: \glossterm{knockback} and \glossterm{push}.

An immune creature cannot gain \glossterm{conditions} or similar effects like \glossterm{poison} if it is immune to them, or if the only effect of that condition would be to apply a specific debuff that it is immune to.
In addition, a creature that temporarily becomes immune to an effect immediately removes all instances of that effect.
For example, a creature that suddenly becomes immune to poison would remove all poisons currently affecting it, and those poisons would not return once the immunity ends.
