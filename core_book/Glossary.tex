\glossdef{attack roll}[attack rolls] A roll required to succeed with an attack.
To make an attack roll, roll 1d10 \add your \glossterm{accuracy} with the attack.
If the result of the attack roll equals or exceeds the target's \glossterm{defense}, the attack succeeds.
Some attacks, especially magical attacks, have effects even if the attack roll fails.

\glossdef{attribute} A core representation of a character's capacity in a wide range of areas. There are six attributes: \glossterm{Strength}, \glossterm{Dexterity}, \glossterm{Constitution}, \glossterm{Intelligence}, \glossterm{Perception}, and \glossterm{Willpower}.

\glossdef{damage reduction} Damage reduction allows you to ignore a certain amount of incoming damage.
Each \glossterm{round}, you ignore the first points of damage you would take.
Damage reduction always specifies an amount of damage it reduces.
Once it reduces that much damage, it stops functioning until the end of the round.

Most sources of damage reduction only apply against a specific type of attack.
For example, a barbarian's damage reduction only applies against physical damage.
If an attack deals multiple types of damage, you must have damage reduction against every type of damage dealt.
For example, damage reduction against piercing damage would not help if you are struck by a morningstar, since it deals both bludgeoning and piercing damage.

Many sources of damage reduction can be ignored and negated by a specific type of attack.
For example, the \spell{barkskin} spell grants damage reduction that can be ignored and negated by fire and slashing damage.
If you are hit an attack that negates your damage reduction, you cannot apply your damage reduction against any other attacks that round.
This includes other attacks that resolve simultaneously, but not attacks that resolved earlier in the round.
For example, if you had the \spell{barkskin} spell active, and you were hit by a club (bludgeoning damage) and a longsword (slashing damage), you would take full damage both attacks.
However, if you were instead hit by a club and a \spell{fireball} spell (fire damage), you would reduce the damage from the club, because the spell resolves later in the round.

\glossdef{darkvision} A creature with darkvision can see in the dark clearly up to a given range.
Beyond that, it can see dimly, treating areas of darkness as shadowy illumination.
Darkvision does not function if a creature is in a brightly lit area, and does not resume functioning until 1 round after the creature leaves the brightly lit area.

In addition, it takes a \minus2 penalty to \glossterm{accuracy} with \glossterm{strikes} and vision-related checks.

\glossdef{dead} A dead creature's soul leaves its body. Dead creatures cannot benefit from normal or magical healing, but they can be restored to life via magic (see \pcref{Resurrecting the Dead}). A dead body decays normally unless magically preserved.

It is an abstract concept designed to represent a variety of actions that all take place nearly simultaneously.

\glossdef{Physical} See \pcref{Ability Tags}.

\glossdef{physical} A physical ability has a tangible component and some form of natural explanation.
Examples include weapon attacks, a dragon's breath weapon, and a barbarian's rage.
Physical attacks often target Armor and Reflex defenses.
Unless otherwise indicated, all abilities are physical in nature.
For details, see \pcref{Physical Abilities}.

\glossdef{physical defenses}[physical defense] Your physical defenses are your Armor and Reflex defenses.
For details, see \pcref{Defenses}.

\glossdef{pinned} A pinned creature is held completely immobile in a grapple.
The only physical actions it can make are to escape the grapple (see \pcref{Grappling}).
Like a \glossterm{helpless} creature, its physical defenses are equal to 10 \add its size modifier.
Unlike a helpless creature, a pinned creature cannot be killed instantly by a coup de grace.

\glossdef{Planar} See \pcref{Ability Tags}.

\glossdef{point of origin}[points of origin] A point of origin is the point where an ability originates from.
A point of origin is always a grid intersection, not the center of a square.
Spells and similar magical abilities use points of origin to determine their areas.
In addition, points of origin are used to calculate \glossterm{cover} and \glossterm{concealment} (see \pcref{Cover}).

\glossdef{poison} For a description of poisons and how they work, see \pcref{Poisons}. For the Poison spell tag, see \pcref{Ability Tags}.

\glossdef{Positive} See \pcref{Ability Tags}.

\glossdef{potency} The potency of a poison, disease, or similar effect determines its attack bonus.

\glossdef{power} The power of an \glossterm{ability} represents how strong the ability is.
Each ability uses a particular kind of power, which is usually calculated in a unique way.
For example, spells use \glossterm{spellpower}, and class abilities typically use a power specified in the class description.

\glossdef{prone} A prone creature is lying on the ground, rather than standing normally.
It takes a \minus2 penalty to \glossterm{accuracy} with physical melee attacks and physical defenses.
It gains a \minus2 bonus to physical defenses against ranged attacks.
A creature can stand up from being prone instead of moving during the movement phase.
This generally requires one free hand.

\glossdef{random effect}[random effects] Random effects change what they do based on a specific die roll.
This does not include effects which require a successful attack or similar roll.
The \spell{prismatic beam} spell is an example of a random effect.
In addition, the random retargeting of certain miscast spells, such as \spell{scorching ray}, is a random effect.

\glossdef{rage bonus} The bonus a character with the rage ability adds to their damage, Fortitude, Willpower, and more.
For details, see \pcref{Rage}.

\glossdef{range} The range of an ability determines how far away it can be used.
You can't use abilities on a target outside of the ability's range.

A range increment is always measured in feet.
You take a \minus1 penalty to accuracy with the ranged attack for each full range increment between you and your target.

\glossdef{rare language}[rare languages] Rare languages are languages that are only spoken by rare or distant creatures or cultures.
They are described in \tref{Rare Languages}.

\glossdef{Retributive} See \pcref{Ability Tags}.

It gains a \plus10 bonus to scent-based Awareness checks (see \pcref{Senses}).

\glossdef{Scrying} See \pcref{Ability Tags}.

\glossdef{shaken} A shaken creature takes a \minus2 penalty to \glossterm{accuracy}, checks, and defenses as long as it is within 100 feet of the source of its fear.
These penalties do not stack with the penalties for being \frightened or \panicked.

If the source of a shaken creature's fear is a creature and is \glossterm{defeated}, this effect is broken.

\glossdef{Shielding} See \pcref{Ability Tags}.

\glossdef{shove} A shove is a heavy \glossterm{combat maneuver} that allows you to move a creature.
For details, see \pcref{Shove}.
