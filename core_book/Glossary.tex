Some skills and abilities have special effects on critical successes.

\glossdef{damage reduction} Damage reduction allows you to ignore a certain amount of incoming damage.
Each \glossterm{round}, you ignore the first points of damage you would take.
Damage reduction always specifies an amount of damage it reduces.
Once it reduces that much damage, it stops functioning until the end of the round.

Most sources of damage reduction only apply against a specific type of attack.
For example, a barbarian's damage reduction only applies against physical damage.
If an attack deals multiple types of damage, you must have damage reduction against every type of damage dealt.
For example, damage reduction against piercing damage would not help if you are struck by a morningstar, since it deals both bludgeoning and piercing damage.

Many sources of damage reduction can be ignored and negated by a specific type of attack.
For example, the \spell{barkskin} spell grants damage reduction that can be ignored and negated by fire and slashing damage.
If you are hit an attack that negates your damage reduction, you cannot apply your damage reduction against any other attacks that round.
This includes other attacks that resolve simultaneously, but not attacks that resolved earlier in the round.
For example, if you had the \spell{barkskin} spell active, and you were hit by a club (bludgeoning damage) and a longsword (slashing damage), you would take full damage both attacks.
However, if you were instead hit by a club and a \spell{fireball} spell (fire damage), you would reduce the damage from the club, because the spell resolves later in the round.

\glossdef{darkvision} A creature with darkvision can see in the dark clearly up to a given range.
Beyond that, it can see dimly, treating areas of darkness as shadowy illumination.
Darkvision does not function if a creature is in a brightly lit area, and does not resume functioning until 1 round after the creature leaves the brightly lit area.
