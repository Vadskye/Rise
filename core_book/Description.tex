\section{Alignment}\label{Alignment}
    A creature's general moral and personal attitudes are represented by its alignment: lawful good, neutral good, chaotic good, lawful neutral, neutral, chaotic neutral, lawful evil, neutral evil, or chaotic evil.

    Alignment is a tool for developing your identity.
    It is not a straitjacket for restricting your actions.
    Each alignment represents a broad range of personality types or personal philosophies, so two characters of the same alignment can still be quite different from each other.
    In addition, few people are completely consistent.

    \subsection{Good vs. Evil}
        Good characters and creatures protect innocent life. Evil characters and creatures debase or destroy innocent life, whether for fun or profit.

        ``Good'' implies altruism, respect for life, and a concern for the dignity of sentient beings. Good characters make personal sacrifices to help others.

        ``Evil'' implies selfishness and a willingness to hurt or kill others. Some evil creatures simply have no compassion for others and kill without qualms if doing so is convenient. Others actively pursue evil, killing for sport or out of duty to some evil deity or master.

        People who are neutral with respect to good and evil have compunctions against killing the innocent but lack the commitment to make sacrifices to protect or help others. Neutral people are committed to others by personal relationships.

        Being good or evil can be a conscious choice. For most people, though, being good or evil is an attitude that one recognizes but does not choose. Being neutral on the good-evil axis usually represents a lack of commitment one way or the other, but for some it represents a positive commitment to a balanced view. While acknowledging that good and evil are objective states, not just opinions, these folk maintain that a balance between the two is the proper place for people, or at least for them.

        Animals and other creatures incapable of moral action are neutral rather than good or evil. Even deadly vipers and tigers that eat people are neutral because they lack the capacity for morally right or wrong behavior.

    \subsection{Law vs. Chaos}
        Lawful characters tell the truth, keep their word, respect authority, honor tradition, and judge those who fall short of their duties.

        Chaotic characters follow their consciences, resent being told what to do, favor new ideas over tradition, and do what they promise if they feel like it.

        ``Law'' implies honor, trustworthiness, obedience to authority, and reliability. On the downside, lawfulness can include close-mindedness, reactionary adherence to tradition, judgmentalness, and a lack of adaptability. Those who consciously promote lawfulness say that only lawful behavior creates a society in which people can depend on each other and make the right decisions in full confidence that others will act as they should.

        ``Chaos'' implies freedom, adaptability, and flexibility. On the downside, chaos can include recklessness, resentment toward legitimate authority, arbitrary actions, and irresponsibility. Those who promote chaotic behavior say that only unfettered personal freedom allows people to express themselves fully and lets society benefit from the potential that its individuals have within them.

        Someone who is neutral with respect to law and chaos has a normal respect for authority and feels neither a compulsion to obey nor a compulsion to rebel. She is honest but can be tempted into lying or deceiving others.

        Devotion to law or chaos may be a conscious choice, but more often it is a personality trait that is recognized rather than being chosen. Neutrality on the lawful-chaotic axis is usually simply a middle state, a state of not feeling compelled toward one side or the other. Some few such neutrals, however, espouse neutrality as superior to law or chaos, regarding each as an extreme with its own blind spots and drawbacks.

        Animals and other creatures incapable of moral action are neutral. Dogs may be obedient and cats free-spirited, but they do not have the moral capacity to be truly lawful or chaotic.

    \subsection{The Nine Alignments}
        Nine distinct alignments define all the possible combinations of the lawful-chaotic axis with the good-evil axis. Each alignment description below depicts a typical character of that alignment. Remember that individuals vary from this norm, and that a given character may act more or less in accord with his or her alignment from day to day. Use these descriptions as guidelines, not as scripts.

        The first six alignments, lawful good through chaotic neutral, are the standard alignments for player characters. The three evil alignments are for monsters and villains.

        \parhead{Lawful Good, ``Crusader''} A lawful good character acts as a good person is expected or required to act. She combines a commitment to oppose evil with the discipline to fight relentlessly. She tells the truth, keeps her word, helps those in need, and speaks out against injustice. A lawful good character hates to see the guilty go unpunished.

        Lawful good is the best alignment you can be because it combines honor and compassion.

        \parhead{Neutral Good, ``Benefactor''} A neutral good character does the best that a good person can do. He is devoted to helping others. He works with kings and magistrates but does not feel beholden to them.

        Neutral good is the best alignment you can be because it means doing what is good without bias for or against order.

        \parhead{Chaotic Good, ``Rebel''} A chaotic good character acts as his conscience directs him with little regard for what others expect of him. He makes his own way, but he's kind and benevolent. He believes in goodness and right but has little use for laws and regulations. He hates it when people try to intimidate others and tell them what to do. He follows his own moral compass, which, although good, may not agree with that of society.

        Chaotic good is the best alignment you can be because it combines a good heart with a free spirit.

        \parhead{Lawful Neutral, ``Judge''} A lawful neutral character acts as law, tradition, or a personal code directs her. Order and organization are paramount to her. She may believe in personal order and live by a code or standard, or she may believe in order for all and favor a strong, organized government.

        Lawful neutral is the best alignment you can be because it means you are reliable and honorable without being a zealot.

        \parhead{Neutral, ``Undecided''} A neutral character does what seems to be a good idea. She doesn't feel strongly one way or the other when it comes to good vs.\ evil or law vs.\ chaos. Most neutral characters exhibit a lack of conviction or bias rather than a commitment to neutrality. Such a character thinks of good as better than evil -- after all, she would rather have good neighbors and rulers than evil ones. Still, she's not personally committed to upholding good in any abstract or universal way.

        Some neutral characters, on the other hand, commit themselves philosophically to neutrality. They see good, evil, law, and chaos as prejudices and dangerous extremes. They advocate the middle way of neutrality as the best, most balanced road in the long run.

        Neutral is the best alignment you can be because it means you act naturally, without prejudice or compulsion.

        \parhead{Chaotic Neutral, ``Free Spirit''} A chaotic neutral character follows his whims. He is an individualist first and last. He values his own liberty but doesn't strive to protect others' freedom. He avoids authority, resents restrictions, and challenges traditions. A chaotic neutral character does not intentionally disrupt organizations as part of a campaign of anarchy. To do so, he would have to be motivated either by good (and a desire to liberate others) or evil (and a desire to make those different from himself suffer). A chaotic neutral character may be unpredictable, but his behavior is not totally random. He is not as likely to jump off a bridge as to cross it.

        Chaotic neutral is the best alignment you can be because it represents true freedom from both society's restrictions and a do-gooder's zeal.

        \parhead{Lawful Evil, ``Dominator''} A lawful evil villain methodically takes what he wants within the limits of his code of conduct without regard for whom it hurts. He cares about tradition, loyalty, and order but not about freedom, dignity, or life. He plays by the rules but without mercy or compassion. He is comfortable in a hierarchy and would like to rule, but is willing to serve. He condemns others not according to their actions but according to species, religion, homeland, or social rank. He is loath to break laws or promises.

        This reluctance comes partly from his nature and partly because he depends on order to protect himself from those who oppose him on moral grounds. Some lawful evil villains have particular taboos, such as not killing in cold blood (but having underlings do it) or not letting children come to harm (if it can be helped). They imagine that these compunctions put them above unprincipled villains.

        Some lawful evil people and creatures commit themselves to evil with a zeal like that of a crusader committed to good. Beyond being willing to hurt others for their own ends, they take pleasure in spreading evil as an end unto itself. They may also see doing evil as part of a duty to an evil deity or master.

        Lawful evil is sometimes called ``diabolical,'' because devils are the epitome of lawful evil.

        Lawful evil is the most dangerous alignment because it represents methodical, intentional, and frequently successful evil.

        \parhead{Neutral Evil, ``Malefactor''} A neutral evil villain does whatever she can get away with. She is out for herself, pure and simple. She sheds no tears for those she kills, whether for profit, sport, or convenience. She has no love of order and holds no illusion that following laws, traditions, or codes would make her any better or more noble. On the other hand, she doesn't have the restless nature or love of conflict that a chaotic evil villain has.

        Some neutral evil villains hold up evil as an ideal, committing evil for its own sake. Most often, such villains are devoted to evil deities or secret societies.

        Neutral evil is the most dangerous alignment because it represents pure evil without honor and without variation.

        \parhead{Chaotic Evil, ``Destroyer''} A chaotic evil character does whatever his greed, hatred, and lust for destruction drive him to do. He is hot-tempered, vicious, arbitrarily violent, and unpredictable. If he is simply out for whatever he can get, he is ruthless and brutal. If he is committed to the spread of evil and chaos, he is even worse. Thankfully, his plans are haphazard, and any groups he joins or forms are poorly organized. Typically, chaotic evil people can be made to work together only by force, and their leader lasts only as long as he can thwart attempts to topple or assassinate him.

        Chaotic evil is sometimes called ``demonic'' because demons are the epitome of chaotic evil.

        Chaotic evil is the most dangerous alignment because it represents the destruction not only of beauty and life but also of the order on which beauty and life depend.

\section{Vital Statistics}

    \subsection{Age}
        You can choose or randomly generate your age.
        If you choose it, it must be at least the minimum age for your species and class (see \trefnp{Random Starting Ages}). Your minimum starting age is the adulthood age of your species plus the number of dice indicated in the entry corresponding to the character's species and class on \trefnp{Random Starting Ages}.

        Alternatively, refer to \trefnp{Random Starting Ages} and roll dice to determine how old you are.

        \begin{dtable}

        \end{dtable}

        With age, your \glossterm{checks} based on physical attributes decrease and your checks based on mental attributes increase (see \trefnp{Aging Effects}).

        When you reach venerable age, the GM secretly rolls your maximum age, which is the number from the Venerable column on \trefnp{Aging Effects} plus the result of the dice roll indicated on the Maximum Age column on that table.
        They record the result.
        If you reach your maximum age, you die of old age at some time during the following year.

        The maximum ages are for player characters. Most people in the world at large die from pestilence, accidents, infections, or violence before getting to venerable age.

    \subsection{Height and Weight}
        The dice roll given in the Height Modifier column determines the character's extra height beyond the base height. That same number multiplied by the dice roll or quantity given in the Weight Modifier column determines the character's extra weight beyond the base weight.

\section{Languages}\label{Languages}

    \parhead{Literacy}
    All characters with an Intelligence of \minus2 or higher are presumed to be literate, allowing them to read and write any language they speak. Each language has an alphabet, though sometimes several spoken languages share a single alphabet.

    \parhead{Language Rarity}
    Some languages are widely spoken in the world, while others are only encountered in unusual circumstances.
    Common languages are summarized on \trefnp{Common Languages}, below.
    Rare languages are summarized on \trefnp{Rare Languages}, below.
    Rare languages are more difficult to learn (see \pcref{Learning Languages}).

\section{Planes}\label{Planes}
    The universe of Rise is divided into \glossterm{planes}.
    A plane is a distinct realm of existence.
    Except for the connections between planes through \glossterm{planar rifts}, each plane is effectively an isolated universe, and different planes can obey different fundamental laws.
    For example, the Material Plane has gravity that exerts a consistent acceleration in a single absolute direction.
    However, the Astral Plane has subjective gravity, where each creature on the plane chooses the direction that gravity pulls it in, if any.

    \subsection{General Cosmology}
        The planes of Rise are divided up into groups.

        \parhead{Inner Planes} These six planes are manifestations of the basic building blocks of the universe.
        Each plane in this group is predominantly composed of a single element or type of energy.

        \parhead{Outer Planes} These nine planes are manifestations of the nine alignments that define the morality of the universe.
        Each plane in this group is strongly associated with a particular alignment.
        The souls of creatures with the corresponding alignment often spend their afterlife in the Outer Planes.

        \parhead{Nexus Planes} These three planes are composite planes with a number of distinct environments and filled with creatures of myriad alignments.
        These planes comprise the majority of civilization across all planes.

        \parhead{Demiplanes} These planes are small, fragmentary realms that are greatly limited in their scope.
        There is no specific list of demiplanes, and they share few common properties.
        Most demiplanes were created for particular purposes by beings of great power, though some simply came into existence through unknown means.

    \subsection{Planar Rifts}
        Normally, there are boundaries between different planes that prevent direct passage between them.
        However, \glossterm{planar rifts} are places where these boundaries have weakened, making interplanar travel easier.
        A planar rift joins a specific location on one plane to a specific location on a different plane.
        Most planar rifts lead to and from the Astral Plane, which is the space between the other planes (see \pcref{The Astral Plane}).

        Most planar rifts still require the use of magic, such as the \spell{plane shift} ritual, to actually cross between planes.
        Some especially large rifts enable physical travel between planes without the use of any magic.

    \subsection{Planar Traits}
        \subsubsection{Gravity Direction}
            The direction of gravity on a plane can take one of the following forms:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Fixed Gravity: Gravity points in a fixed direction and with a fixed strength at all locations on the plane.
                \item Absolute Directional Gravity: Gravity points in a consistent direction according to a rule that applies equally to everything on the plane, but which is not in a fixed direction.
                    For example, a plane filled with floating spheres where gravity always points towards the closest sphere has absolute directional gravity.
                \item Subjective Gravity: Each creature on the plane chooses the direction of gravity for that creature.
                    The plane has no gravity for unattended objects and nonsentient creatures.
                    A creature on the plane can make use the \textit{control gravity} ability as a \glossterm{minor action}.
                    \begin{freeability}{Control Gravity}
                        Make a DR 10 Willpower check.
                        Success means that you choose the direction of gravity that applies to you on the current plane.
                        Alternately, you can choose for gravity to not apply to you.

                        Failure means you gain a \plus2 bonus to the next \textit{control gravity} ability you use on this plane.
                        This bonus stacks with itself and lasts until you succeed at a \textit{control gravity} ability on this plane.
                    \end{freeability}
            \end{itemize}

        \subsubsection{Gravity Strength} The strength of gravity on a plane can take one of the following forms:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Normal Gravity: Gravity is about the strength of Earth.
                \item No Gravity: There is no gravity on the plane.
                    The \glossterm{range increment} of ranged weapons is tripled.
                    % TODO: what additional effects are there?
                \item Light Gravity: Gravity is about half the strength of Earth.
                    % Should there be check penalties?
                    The weight of all items is halved.
                    The \glossterm{range increment} of ranged weapons is doubled.
                \item Heavy Gravity: Gravity is about twice the strength of Earth.
                    Creatures take a \minus2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity-based checks.
                    The weight of all items is doubled.
                    The \glossterm{range increment} of ranged weapons is halved, to a minimum of 5 feet.

                \item Extreme Gravity: Gravity is about four times the strength of Earth.
                    Creatures take a \minus4 penalty to Strength and Dexterity-based checks.
                    The weight of all items is quadrupled.
                    The \glossterm{range increment} of ranged weapons is one quarter of the normal value, to a minimum of 5 feet.

        \subsubsection{Planar Connectivity}
            Different planes have different degrees of connection to other planes.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Isolated: The plane is difficult to reach or leave.
                    It has no permanent \glossterm{planar rifts}, and temporary rifts are rare or nonexistent.
                \item Stable Connected: The plane has multiple permanent \glossterm{planar rifts}.
                    However, temporary rifts are rare.
                \item Unstable Connected: The plane has no permanent \glossterm{planar rifts}, but temporary rifts are common.
                \item Conduit: The plane has a large number of permanent \glossterm{planar rifts}, and temporary rifts are common.
            \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Plane Descriptions}
        \subsubsection{The Material Plane}
            The Material Plane is the plane that most Rise adventures begin on.
            It is the most familiar to most humanoid creatures.
            It has the following planar traits:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Gravity direction: Fixed
                \item Gravity strength: Normal
                \item Planar connectivity: Isolated
            \end{itemize}

        \subsubsection{The Astral Plane}\label{The Astral Plane}
            The Astral Plane is the space between the other planes.
            It is a necessary intermediate destination on most planar journeys, as the vast majority of \glossterm{planar rifts} lead to and from the Astral Plane.
            It has the following planar traits:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Directional gravity: Subjective
                \item Gravity strength: Normal
                \item Planar connectivity: Conduit
            \end{itemize}

            Most activity on the Astral Plane occurs in a space called the Inner Astral Plane, a massive region where almost all planar rifts on the plane appear.
            % Are there any other infinite planes?
            However, unlike all other planes, the Astral Plane has no known limits to its extent, and may in fact be infinite.
            The rest of the plane is known as the Deep Astral Plane, and few venture into those sparsely populated realms.
            % This should be more clearly defined
            The Deep Astral Plane has magical turbulence that interferes with long-range communication and transportation magic, making exploration difficult.
