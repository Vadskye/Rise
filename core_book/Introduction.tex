\chapter{Introduction}

\section{What Is Rise?}
    Rise is a role-playing game.
    In Rise, you play a character of your own design.
    Your character can try to do anything you can imagine in a world that the game master, or GM, creates.
    Of course, you won't always succeed.
    Your character's abilities are defined in the pages ahead; when you're done creating a character, it will have a personality of its own, along with strengths, weaknesses, and special abilities.
    Usually, your character will go on adventures with other characters, and together, you will create and experience a story with the game master.

\section{How To Take Actions}

    If you want your character to do something in Rise, just tell the game master what you want your character to do.
    Sometimes, you will have to wait until it's your turn.
    In many cases, your character will simply take the action --- you don't need to roll or check your character's abilities to walk downstairs and order a dwarven ale.

    However, sometimes you'll want to take a dramatic action with a chance of failure, such as picking a lock or swinging from a chandelier.
    In that case, you roll a ten-sided die, or d10, and add a number to the number on the die.
    This result is compared to a number representing how difficult the action is.
    For \glossterm{attacks}, this number is the \glossterm{defense} of the creature or object you're attacking.
    For \glossterm{checks}, this number is the \glossterm{difficulty rating} of the task you're attempting.
    If your result is at least as high as the defense or difficulty rating, your character's action succeeds.
    If it is lower, your character's action fails.

    The number you add to the d10 roll represents how likely your character is to succeed at the action.
    If your character is very strong, they will probably succeed at breaking down a door --- but if they are not very perceptive, they will probably not notice the trap.
    Your character's abilities can be modified in many ways, but they are most affected by three things: \glossterm{attributes}, \glossterm{skills}, and \glossterm{classes}.

    \subsection{Attacks and Checks}
        In Rise, each character has many different actions they can take.
        You can take many actions without needing to roll a die at all.
        However, eventually you will need to do something where there is a dramatically significant chance of failure.
        In that case, you will need to roll a die to see if you succeed or fail.
        How likely you are to succeed at that action depends on your character's numerical statistics.

        Almost all rolls you will need to make can be described as an \glossterm{attack roll} or a \glossterm{check}.
        In either case, you roll 1d10 and add a number based on how good your character is at the relevant roll.
        If the result of the roll is high enough, you succeed.
        For attack rolls, the minimum number you need to get is the \glossterm{defense} of the creature or object you are attacking.
        For checks, the minimum number you need to get is the \glossterm{difficulty rating} of the task you are performing.

        In general, abilities that affect \glossterm{enemies} in some potentially harmful way require attack rolls.
        For example, hitting something with your sword is an attack, and requires an attack roll to succeed.
        In contrast, abilities that affect yourself, the environment, or \glossterm{allies} usually require checks instead.
        For example, climbing a cliff requires a check using the Climb skill (see \pcref{Climb}).

    \subsection{Opposed Actions}
        Sometimes, you're competing with another creature, such as when you are trying to hold a door closed and a ferocious ogre is trying to shove it open.
        In that case, you both roll a d10 and add your modifiers, and the creature with the higher result wins.
        This is called an opposed check.
        If you get the same result, the creature with the higher modifier wins.
        If you have the same modifier, roll again to break the tie.

\section{Narrative Pacing}
    A typical game of Rise is broken up into two distinct concepts.
    Sometimes, you will interact with the world in broad, sweeping descriptions, as you describe in general terms what your character does.
    For example, you and your group may decide to travel overland for seven days to reach a distant city.
    Just like you don't need to mention every time your character breathes or takes a step, you don't need to track every second of time spent on that journey.
    Until something of dramatic significance happens, the GM should narrate the events of the journey in general terms to avoid spending time on irrelevant details.

    If something important happens, the pace of the game should change to focus on the current events.
    For example, if your group is ambushed by roaming bandits, the exact actions you take become important.
    This is called an encounter.
    During an encounter, the GM should ask each player to describe their character's actions more precisely.
    If the encounter is time-sensitive, such as combat, the GM should track the flow of time in \glossterm{rounds}.
    A round represents six seconds of time, so there are ten rounds per minute.

    Not all encounters require tracking time precisely.
    For example, if you and your party encounter a broken-down caravan carrying an angry prince, your exact actions can be important.
    Whether you show appropriate deference and fix his caravan, ignore him, or kill him to steal his jewelry can have important repurcussions in the game world.
    However, the exact time it takes to make that decision and execute on it is not usually important.

    Not every challenge needs to be handled with the narrative pacing of an encounter, especially if the outcome of the challenge is uninteresting or predetermined.
    Even combat can be described in broad terms, such as if you are significantly more powerful than your foes and your victory is assured.
    In all cases, the GM decides how to handle the flow of time and the narrative pacing.
    They may have information you don't about what is important and what is irrelevant.

\section{Principles of Rise}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{The Game Master controls the world.} Everything about the game world is up to the GM\@: the people your character meets, the challenges they will overcome, and the very ground under their feet.
            Even the ``rules'' of the game are completely subject to the GM's whim.
        \item \textbf{You control your character.} A GM should never tell you how your character feels or what they try to do --- unless, of course, your character is being controlled by hostile magic or some other power.
        \item \textbf{Respect and trust are critical.} The GM has a great deal of power in Rise, and the players have to trust that the GM knows what they are doing.
            Likewise, the GM needs to let the players do what they want --- even if it doesn't suit their idea of what ``should'' happen.
            Some of the most memorable events happen when players do things that are totally unexpected.
        \item \textbf{Everything is flexible.} Rise contains hundreds of pages of rules.
            We think they're pretty good rules.
            But sometimes, you don't need them all --- or you think you've come up with something better.
            Do whatever works for you and your group.
        \item \textbf{Do what makes sense.} This book doesn't contain rules for how to drink water, sleep, or blink.
            If something isn't described explicitly here, assume that it works the same way it does in reality.
        \item \textbf{It's just a game, so have fun.}
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Rule of Drama}

        The Rule of Drama is simple: \textbf{Only dramatic actions matter}.
        In general, an action has dramatic significance if there is a consequence for failure, the exact time required to perform the task is important, or the game master says so.
        This has several effects.

        \subsubsection{Checks without Rolls}
            A check represents an attempt to accomplish a dramatically significant goal, usually while under some sort of time pressure or distraction.
            When there is no dramatic significance to the task, a check should not be rolled.

            \parhead{Taking 5}\label{Taking 5}
            Normally, if a check would be required but there is no dramatic significance to the check, assume the character rolled a 5 when determining whether the check is successful.
            This is called ``taking 5''.

            \parhead{Taking 10}\label{Taking 10}
            If a character would not succeed when taking 5, the character can try to ``take 10'' instead.
            Taking 10 requires spending ten times the amount of time normally required to accomplish the task.
            If a task takes a variable amount of time, assume it took the average amount of time required to make a check.
            In exchange, the character calculates their check result if they had rolled a 10.

            Essentially, taking 10 means the character repeatedly attempts the task until they succeed.
            It is possible to take 10 on a task that has consequences for failure, but taking 10 guarantees that those consequences occur.

        \subsubsection{Narrative Time}
            In most cases, the exact time of day and exactly how long an action takes is not very important.
            No one really cares whether the orc horde broke through the town gates at the crack of dawn, or at 6:55 AM\@.
            Likewise, travelling from a tavern in a city to the blacksmith probably takes a few minutes, depending on the size of the city, but it's not usually important.

            Rise contains rules which you can use to decide exactly how much time things take, but when it's not important, it's generally better to only worry about time in broad strokes.
            It makes everyone's life a bit easier --- especially for the GM\@.

\section{Character Creation}

    The first thing you will probably want to do in Rise is create a character.
    This involves a mixture of thematic and mechanical decisions that will work together to create a fun character that is rewarding to play.
    There are five thematic considerations when creating a character: concept, personality, motivation, background, and appearance.
    There are five mechanical considerations: attributes, species, class, skills, and feats.
    These decisions are described below in a recommended order.
    However, you can make these decisions in any order, and you may find it easier to create a character in a different way.  

    \subsection{Character Concept}

        Fundamentally, who is your character?
        You should think of a short phrase that describes the core concept behind the character you will create.
        It's best to think in broad strokes when creating a character concept.
        Your concept should be more than just a factual description of your species or what you do.
        It should be something that makes you memorable.
        Some sample character concepts are given below for inspiration.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Pragmatic wanderer
            \item Artistic pixie
            \item Mushroom-obsessed hermit
            \item Bumbling do-gooder
            \item Dim-witted bodyguard
            \item Cowardly storyteller
            \item Bear-barian
            \item Parsimonious law enforcer
            \item Peaceful naturalist
            \item Trigger-happy pyromaniac
            \item Heroic, simple-minded warrior
            \item Friendly necromancer
            \item Chaotic speed demon
            \item Pompous ex-noble
            \item Sarcastic mercenary
            \item Battle-scarred priest
            \item Ambitious arcane prodigy
            \item Charismatic musician
            \item Aloof scholar
            \item Blunt-spoken warrior
            \item Crazed prophet
            \item Polite warrior
            \item World-weary pirate
            \item Devout cultist
            \item Con artist with a heart of gold
        \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Personality}

        How does your character behave?
        You should decide, in broad terms, what your character's personality is.
        This will change over time, especially as you start playing the character in the game, so you don't need to define everything perfectly.
        However, having a general sense of how your character behaves is helpful.

        For most games, it's important to have a personality that can tolerate working with others in a group.
        A character that is excessively aloof, moody, or obnoxious can make the game more difficult to enjoy for everyone.
        Likewise, a character who tries to speak for everyone or who repeatedly steals the spotlight from others can be frustrating to work with.
        You should figure out the right balance with your fellow players and your GM.\@

    \subsection{Motivation}

        Why does your character act the way they do?
        To help you answer that question, there are several choices you must make to determine your character's motivation: an alignment, a goal, and a flaw.

    \subsection{Alignment}

        Your character's alignment reflects their moral character: are they more inclined to good or to evil, to order or chaos?
        Alignments are described in more detail at \pcref{Alignment}.

    \subsection{Species}
        Is your character a surly dwarf, an agile elf, or a dim-witted half-orc?
        There are six core species in Rise: Humans, dwarves, elves, gnomes, halflings, and half-orcs.
        Your character's species has only a mild effect on your character's abilities, but it can be important when thinking about your personality and background.
        Species are described in more detail at \pcref{Species}.

    \subsection{Attributes}
        Is your character strong and stupid, frail but agile, or just generally talented?
        There are six core attributes in Rise: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Perception, and Willpower.
        These attributes determine a great deal about your character's strengths and weaknesses.
        Attributes are described in more detail at \pcref{Attributes}.

    \subsection{Class}
        Your character's class is what they have chosen to focus on, and their source of power --- the fundamental element that makes them rise above a mere commoner.
        It is the most mechanically significant choice you make.
        Classes are described in more detail at \pcref{Classes}.

    \subsection{Background}

    \subsection{Appearance}

    \subsection{Equipment}
        Your character begins with 75 gold pieces, and you decide how to spend them.
