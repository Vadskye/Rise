\chapter{Skills}\label{Skills}

Skills represent the myriad of talents that people can have, such as cooking or swimming.
This chapter describes each skill, including common uses for those skills.

\section{Skill Overview}

    This section desribes how you acquire and use skills.

    \subsection{Skill Points}\label{Skill Points}

        At 1st level, you gain six skill points.
        Skill points can be spent to improve your abilities with particular skills (see Skill Training, below).
        Unless otherwise noted, skill points can be spent to improve any skill.

        You gain additional skill points equal to twice your base Intelligence.
        If your Intelligence is negative, you similarly lose skill points equal to twice your base Intelligence.
        Some other abilities, such as the rogue \textit{skill lore} ability, can grant additional skill points (see Skill Lore, page \pref{Rog:Skill Lore}).

    \subsection{Skill Training}\label{Skill Training}

        You can spend skill points to become \glossterm{trained} or \glossterm{mastered} in skills.
        Your level of training can grant you a bonus to attacks and checks using that skill, as described below.
        If you are already \glossterm{trained} in a skill, you only pay the difference in skill point costs to become \glossterm{mastered} in that skill.

        \begin{itemize}
            \itemhead{Untrained} Becoming untrained in a skill costs no skill points.
                You are untrained in all skills by default.
                Being untrained in a skill grants no bonus to the skill.
            \itemhead{Trained} Becoming trained in a skill costs one skill point.
                In addition, if the base value for one of your attributes is at least 2, you become trained in all of your \glossterm{class skills} associated with that attribute.
                Being trained in a skill gives you a bonus with the skill equal to 2 \add half your level.
            \itemhead{Mastered} Mastering a skill costs three skill points, or two skill points if the skill is a \glossterm{class skill} for you.
                Being mastered in a skill gives you a bonus with the skill equal to 3 \add your level.
        \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Skill Modifier}\label{Skill Modifier}

        Your bonus with a skill is calculated as follows:

        \begin{figure}[h]
            \centering Training bonus (see \pcref{Skill Training}) \add base value of \glossterm{key attribute} \add other bonuses and penalties
        \end{figure}

        \subparhead{Bonuses and Penalties} Species abilities, class abilities, penalties from \glossterm{encumbrance}, and other effects can increase or decrease your bonus with a skill.

    \subsection{Key Attributes With Skills}\label{Key Attributes With Skills}
        Most skills have a single \glossterm{key attribute} they are associated with.
        You gain a bonus or penalty to attacks and checks with each skill equal to your base value with that skill's key attribute.
        In addition, if your base value for an attribute is at least 2, you are automatically trained in all of that attribute's skills.

    \subsection{Class Skills}\label{Class Skills}
        Each class has a set of skills that members of that class are typically skilled at.
        Your bonus with skills that are not class skills for you can be just as high as your bonus with class skills, but it requires more investment.
        You are automatically \glossterm{trained} in all \glossterm{class skills} associated with each of your attributes that has a base value of 2 or higher.
        In addition, mastering class skills is cheaper than mastering other skills.
        It costs two skill points to master a non-class skill if you are already trained in that skill, but only one skill point to master a class skill.

        The class skills for each class are summarized on \trefnp{Class Skills}.

    \subsection{Trying Again}
        In general, you can try a skill check again if you fail, and you can keep trying indefinitely. Some skills, however, have consequences of failure that must be taken into account. A few skills are virtually useless once a check has failed on an attempt to accomplish a particular task. For most skills, when a character has succeeded once at a given task, additional successes are meaningless.

        Skills that require a free action to use can never be used more than once for the same purpose within a round. For example, if you fail to notice a creature sneaking up on you, you can't keep making Awareness checks as a free action until you notice. You could try again in the next round, however.

    \subsection{Special Skill Checks}

        \subsubsection{Opposed Checks}
            An opposed check is a check whose success or failure is determined by comparing the check result to another character's check result. In an opposed check, the higher result succeeds, while the lower result fails. In case of a tie, the higher check modifier wins. If these scores are the same, roll again to break the tie. Typical opposed checks are described in \trefnp{Example Opposed Checks}

            \begin{dtable}
                \lcaption{Example Opposed Checks}

                \end{dtabularx}
                1 An Intimidate check can be opposed by the target's Mental defense, not a skill check. See the Intimidate skill description for more information. \\
                2 You can also tie up a creature while grappling with them (see \pcref{Grapple Actions}).
            \end{dtable}

        \subsubsection{Group Skill Checks}
            When multiple characters are trying to use the same skill simultaneously, they may be able to work together. Most skills can be done as a group skill check, where the more skilled characters assist the less skilled characters and work together to find the best result. There are two kinds of group skill checks.

            \parhead{Collaborative Checks} When making a collaborative skill check, each member of the group gets their own result. Collaborative checks might include a group of scouts sneaking up on an enemy camp, a group of adventurers climbing a cliff, or a group of spies lying about their true allegiances.

            When making a collaborative check, the group must choose a leader before making the check.
            Each member of the group can make the check using the higher of their skill modifier and half the leader's skill modifier. Other modifiers apply normally.

            The group leader must remain in a position to help the other members of the group for the group members to gain this benefit. For example, if a group is making a collaborative check to leap across a chasm, the leader must jump last. If the group is making a collaborative Stealth check, the leader must remain adjacent to the other members of the group to prevent their mistakes quietly. The exact circumstances depend on the situation.

            \parhead{Collective Checks} The group works together to get a single result. Collective checks might include a group of diplomats persuading a noble to go to war, a group of medics tending to a dying warrior, or a group of scouts keeping watch for enemy attacks.

            When making a collective check, the group simply uses the highest result from any character making the check.

            \parhead{Making Group Skill Checks} A group skill check is not always possible. If the whole group is leaping over a chasm at once to escape a dragon, there is not enough time to designate a leader and have them aid the others to make a collaborative check. In general, a group skill check is only possible if the group has at least five rounds to work together, though this time may vary widely depending on the situation and the skill being used.

    \subsection{Tasks}\label{Tasks}

        Each skill contains a brief description of how the skill is usually used.
        This description is followed by a series of \glossterm{tasks}, which are particular ways to use skills.
        These tasks are simply examples, and do not list everything the skill can be used for.
        You should be creative with your skills, rather than only using the tasks explicitly listed.

    \subsubsection{Hidden Tasks}\label{Hidden Tasks}
        Some \glossterm{tasks} are called \glossterm{hidden tasks}, and are marked with a [Hidden] tag in the task name.
        These tasks rely on hidden information that you should not have access to.
        For example, you can make a Social Insight check to identify whether a creature is lying.
        If you are told to make a Social Insight check when a creature talks, you can deduce that it is probably lying regardless of the success or failure of the check.
        To solve this issue, any checks for hidden tasks should be made secretly by the GM.\@
        Usually, you should not even know that you made a check unless you learn a result from it.

        If you are suspicious of a situation, you can ask the GM to make a relevant check for you.
        This usually should not grant a bonus to the check, but it can ensure that the GM did not forget to make the check!

\newpage
\skill{Agility}{Dex}
        The Agility skill represents your ability to balance, tumble, and perform similar feats of agility and poise.

    \subsection{Agile Charge}
        You can make a \glossterm{difficulty rating} 10 Agility check while \glossterm{charging} to change directions while charging.
        Success means you can make a single turn of up to 90 degrees during the movement.
        Failure means you can't change direction, though you can continue your movement or stop.
        Critical failure means you stop where you tried to change direction and fall \prone.

    \subsection{Balance}\label{Balance}

        When you are on a slippery or narrow surface, you must make an Agility check to move.
        Success means you move along the surface at half speed.
        Critical success means you move along the surface at full speed.
        Failure means your action is wasted, and you do not move.
        Critical failure means you fall prone.
        If you do not have enough room to fall prone, you may fall off of the edge you are balancing on.

        The \glossterm{difficulty rating} of Agility checks to balance varies with the surface, as described in \trefnp{Balancing Difficulty Ratings}.
        In addition, if you are forcibly moved while on a slippery or narrow surface, you must make an Agility check against the same \glossterm{difficulty rating}.\@
        Success means you stay standing.
        Failure means you fall prone.

        \begin{dtable}
            \lcaption{Balancing Difficulty Ratings}
            \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{l X}
                \tb{Narrow Surface}           & \tb{Difficulty Rating} \tableheaderrule

            \end{dtabularx}
        \end{dtable}

    \subsection{Mitigate Fall}
        As you hit the ground after a fall, you can make an Agility check to reduce falling damage.
        A \glossterm{difficulty rating} 5 check allows you to treat a fall as if it were 10 feet shorter.
        For every 10 points by which you beat that \glossterm{difficulty rating}, you can reduce the falling damage by 10 additional feet.

    \subsection{Rapid Stand}\label{Rapid Stand}
        You can use the \textit{rapid stand} ability as a \glossterm{minor action}.
        \begin{freeability}{Rapid Stand}[Swift]
            You make a \glossterm{difficulty rating} 15 Agility check to stand up from a prone position quickly.
            Success means you stand up.
            Since this is a \glossterm{Swift} ability, standing up in this way means you do not suffer the penalties for being prone during the current phase.
            Failure means you fail to stand up.
        \end{freeability}

    The Awareness skill represents your ability to observe things which you might otherwise fail to notice. It can be used to spot concealed things, to correctly identify sounds, or to smell the distinctive rotting flesh smell that accompanies undead.

    Each creature has a variety of senses. The Awareness skill governs the use of every sense. It is most commonly used with sight, hearing, and smell, though other uses are possible. Often, bonuses or penalties will apply only to certain senses. For example, it is extremely difficult to see when there is no light, but that has no effect on how difficult it is for you to hear sounds. In such cases, you only roll one Awareness check, and you apply the modifiers separately for each sense.

    While sleeping, you take a \minus10 penalty to the Awareness skill.

    \subsection{Discern Illusion [Hidden]}
        When you observe the effect of a \glossterm{Sensation} ability, you can make an Awarenss check to notice its unreal nature.
        The \glossterm{difficulty rating} is specified in the description of the ability creating the illusion, but is usually equal to a check result made when using the ability.
        Success means you recognize the effect as an illusion, and can see through it as if it was almost entirely transparent.
        Failure means you don't notice anything amiss.

        If the illusion is completely missing a sense that should logically be present, such as a \spell{silent image} of people marching in heavy armor, the \glossterm{difficulty rating} to interact with the illusion with that sense is lowered by 5.

        You cannot retry this check until you gain meaningful new information that would help you identify the illusion.

    \subsection{Identify Disguise [Hidden]}\label{Identify Disguise}
        When you observe a disguised creature or object, you can make an Awareness check to identify the disguise.
        The \glossterm{difficulty rating} is equal to the Disguise check result used to create the disguise (see \pcref{Disguise}).
        Success means you know that the creature or object is disguised.
        Critical success means you can also discern its true appearance beneath the disguise.
        Failure means you don't notice anything unusual.

        You cannot retry this check until you gain meaningful new information that would help you identify the disguise.

    \subsection{Identify Forgery}
        As a standard action, you can make an Awareness check to identify forgeries.
        The \glossterm{difficulty rating} to identify a forgery is equal to the Craft check result used to make the item (see \pcref{Craft}).
        Success means you correctly identify whether the item is a forgery or not.
        Failure means you don't notice anything indicating the item is a forgery.

        You cannot retry this check until you gain meaningful new information that would help you identify the forgery.

    \subsection{Notice Creatures and Events}
        As a free action, you can notice creatures and events around you.
        The \glossterm{difficulty rating} depends on the sense used and the obviousness of the event, as described on tables below.
        Success means you notice something, but you don't know any details -- only its general direction.
        For every 5 points by which you beat the \glossterm{difficulty rating}, you learn an additional piece of information, such as what caused the event or the location of the creature.
        Failure means you don't notice anything.

        This can be used to determine the precise location of a creature or object, even if you can't see it. The \glossterm{difficulty rating} to identify the location is equal to the \glossterm{difficulty rating} to notice the creature or object using the appropriate sense \add 5 (since you need to learn an additional piece of information).

    \subsection{Read Lips}
        When you see a creature speaking, you can make an sight-based Awareness check to read its lips.
        The \glossterm{difficulty rating} is 10 for ordinary conversation, or up to 20 if the speaking creature makes an effort to avoid moving its lips.
        You must be able to understand the language spoken.
        Success means you can understand the general content of the message, but not the exact words.
        Critical success means you understand the exact words.
        Failure means you don't understand the message.

    \subsection{Search}\label{Search}
        As a standard action, you can use the \textit{search} ability to closely investigate a small area.
        \begin{freeability}{Search}
            Make an Awareness check to notice things in a single 5-ft.\ square within 10 feet of you.
            You gain a \plus5 bonus to this check.
        \end{freeability}

    \subsection{Senses}\label{Senses}

        \parhead{Sight} The \glossterm{difficulty rating} to see something depends on the obviousness of the sight, as shown on \trefnp{Sight-based Difficulty Ratings}, and other modifiers given at \trefnp{Awareness Difficulty Modifiers}.

        \begin{dtable}
            \lcaption{Sight-based Difficulty Ratings}
            \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{X l}

                Creature trying to hide                & Stealth check result\fn{2}                        \\
                Hidden trap, secret door, or mechanism & Craft or Devices check result                     \\
                Magic trap                             & 15 \add double level of spell used to create trap \\
            \end{dtabularx}
            1 Always add any appropriate modifiers from \tref{Awareness Difficulty Modifiers} \\
            2 Don't add size-based difficulty modifiers since they are redundant with the modifiers applied to the creature's Stealth check result.
        \end{dtable}

        \parhead{Sound} The \glossterm{difficulty rating} to hear a sound depends on the intensity of the sound, as shown on \trefnp{Sound-based Difficulty Ratings}, and other modifiers given at \trefnp{Awareness Difficulty Modifiers}.

        \begin{dtable}
            \lcaption{Sound-based Difficulty Ratings}
            \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{X l}

                Creature trying to be quiet           & Stealth check result\fn{2} \\
            \end{dtabularx}
            1 Always add any appropriate modifiers from \tref{Awareness Difficulty Modifiers} \\
            2 Don't add size-based difficulty modifiers since they are redundant with the modifiers applied to the creature's Stealth check result.
        \end{dtable}

        \parhead{Scent} The \glossterm{difficulty rating} to smell something depends on the intensity of the scent, as shown on \trefnp{Scent-based Difficulty Ratings}, and other modifiers given at \trefnp{Awareness Difficulty Modifiers}.

        The \glossterm{difficulty ratings} given are for a creature with an ordinary sense of smell, like a human.

        Smell intensity can vary widely depending on the circumstances. In general, an unusually strong smell, such as a creature wearing perfume, has a \glossterm{difficulty rating} which is 5 lower. An unusually weak smell, such as a creature who has just taken an unscented bath, has a \glossterm{difficulty rating} which is 5 higher.

        Smells dissipate quickly with distance. Double the normal distance modifiers for scent-based perception checks.

        \subparhead{Scent Ability}\label{Scent} Some creatures have an unusually good sense of smell. Creatures with the scent ability gain a \plus5 bonus to scent-based Awareness checks.

        \begin{dtable}
            \lcaption{Scent-based Difficulty Ratings}
            \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{X l}
                \tb{Situation}                               & \tb{Base Difficulty Rating\fn{1}} \tableheaderrule
                Strong scent (rotting flesh, pungent spices) & 0  \\
                Moderate scent (fresh food)                  & 5  \\
                Living creature                              & 10 \\
            \end{dtabularx}
            1 Always add any appropriate modifiers from \tref{Awareness Difficulty Modifiers} \\
        \end{dtable}

        \parhead{Other Senses} Other senses can exist, and creatures can make Awareness checks to use those other senses appropriately.

    \subsection{Modifiers}
        All Awareness checks share the same set of modifiers, in addition to certain modifiers which depend on the sense. These are noted on \trefnp{Awareness Difficulty Modifiers}.

        This table should not generally be consulted during a game. It is provided to make it easier to estimate a task's difficulty.

        \begin{dtable}

        \end{dtable}

\newpage
\skill{Deception}{---}
        The Deception skill represents your ability to lie or otherwise mislead people without being caught.
        Using a Deception check is part of conversation or other actions, so it requires no special action to perform.

    \subsection{Blend In}
        You can make a Deception check to blend in with a crowd.
        Your Deception check is opposed by the Awareness checks of anyone looking for you.
        Success means you remain unobserved.
        Failure means the person looking for you finds you.

        If you act differently from the crowd you are trying to blend in with, anyone observing you gets a \plus5 bonus to find you. You may need to make Awareness or Social Insight checks to figure out how to act, depending on the situation. If you are extremely dissimilar from the crowd, such as a naked person in a temple or a human among halflings, anyone observing you may gain a \plus10 or greater bonus to find you.

    \subsection{Distract}\label{Distract}
        As a standard action, you can make a Deception check to distract a creature you are interacting with.
        Your Deception check is opposed by your target's Social Insight check.
        Success means they take a \minus5 penalty to the Awareness and Social Insight skills against targets other than you until the end of the next round.
        Failure means they take no penalty, and realize you were trying to distract them.
        You can continue distracting the target by using this ability against them each round.
        The \glossterm{difficulty rating} increases by 2 for each consecutive round that you have distracted the same creature.

        Normally, distracting a creature requires both visible motion and sound.
        If you take a \minus5 penalty to the Deception check, you can distract a creature without moving, or without making sound, but not without both.
        In addition, you can take a \minus5 penalty to your Deception check to distract everyone who can see or hear you.

        If you successfully distract a creature, you can attempt to hide from that creature as if you were not being observed (see \pcref{Stealth}, for details).

    \subsection{Impersonate}\label{Impersonate}
        When you are pretending to be another creature, you can assume the mannerisms and speech patterns of the creature you are impersonating.
        To do so, you must make a Deception check.
        Anyone observing you can oppose your check with a Social Insight check to identify the impersonation (see the \textit{identify disguise} ability, page \pref{Identify Disguise}).
        If you succeed, the observer thinks your impersonation is accurate.
        If you critically succeed, they also take a \minus5 penalty to any other check to see through your impersonation, such as to notice a flawed disguise.
        If they succeed, they notice inconsistencies or mistakes in your impersonation, and may realize you are not what you seem.

        % Technically these should be bonuses to the checks observers make, but that's confusing
        If you do not know how you are supposed to act, or are physically unable to perform necessary actions, impersonation is more difficult.
        You take a \minus2 penalty if you cannot replicate minor details of an impersonation, such as a deep voice beyond your vocal range.
        You take a \minus5 penalty if you cannot replicate significant details of an impersonation, such as the singing voice of a famous bard or the noble manners of a crown prince.
        You take a \minus10 or greater penalty if you cannot replicate fundamental aspects of the impersonation, such as the actions required to lead a complex ritual as an archmage.
        Observers who do not know your impersonation is inaccurate can take similar penalties; see the \textit{identify disguise} ability for details.

        A creature may not believe your impersonation even if you make a successful Deception check.
        For example, a halfling can impersonate an orc's voice perfectly with a Deception check, but without a disguise anyone who sees the halfling will immediately realize it is not an orc (see \pcref{Disguise}).

    \subsection{Lie}
        As a free action, when you say something which you know is untrue, you can make a Deception check to avoid revealing your deception.
        Anyone observing you lie can oppose your check with a Social Insight check.
        If you succeed, the observer does not notice any indication that you are lying.
        If they succeed, they realize that you are lying.

        A creature that fails its Social Insight check may choose not to believe you for other reasons.
        This check only prevents a creature from recognizing the lie based on your body language and behavior.
        To convince creatures to believe or take actions based on lies, you need the Persuasion skill (see \pcref{Compel Belief}).

    \subsection{Secret Message}
        As part of normal speech, you can make a Deception check to attempt to convey a hidden message to another character without others understanding it using codes, metaphors, and similar misdirection tools. The \glossterm{difficulty rating} is 10 for simple messages and 15 for complex messages. If the message contains completely new information, the \glossterm{difficulty rating} increases by 5. You can freely increase the \glossterm{difficulty rating} to make the message more difficult to intercept, but doing so also makes it more difficult for the intended recipient to interpret.

        Anyone witnessing the exchange may make a Social Insight check against the same \glossterm{difficulty rating} to identify the hidden message.
        Creatures who know your system for conveying hidden messages -- normally, the intended recipient -- receive a \plus10 bonus.
        Creatures who know in advance that a message will be conveyed also receive a \plus5 bonus on this check.

\newpage
\skill{Climb}{Str}
    The Climb skill represents your ability to climb obstacles.

    \subsection{Climb}
        You can make a Climb check as a \glossterm{move action} to move up, down, or across a slope, a wall, or some other steep incline (or even a ceiling with handholds). Success means you move a number of feet equal to the size of your space, as described on \trefnp{Climb Speeds}. Critical success means you move at twice that speed. Failure means your action is wasted and you do not move. Critical failure means you fall.

        You need both hands free to climb, but you may cling to a wall with one hand while you cast a spell or take some other action that requires only one hand.

        \begin{dtable}
            \lcaption{Climb Speeds}
            \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{l X}

                Diminuitive & 1 ft.      \\
                Tiny        & 2-1/2 ft.  \\
                Small       & 5 ft.      \\
                Medium      & 5 ft.      \\
                Large       & 10 ft.     \\
                Huge        & 15 ft.     \\
                Gargantuan  & 20 ft.     \\
                Colossal    & 25\add ft. \\
            \end{dtabularx}
        \end{dtable}

        The \glossterm{difficulty rating} of the check depends on the difficulty of the task and the conditions of the climbing surface, as shown on \trefnp{Climb Difficulty Ratings} and \trefnp{Climb Difficulty Modifiers}.

        \begin{dtable}

                \plus5                         & Surface is very slippery, such as ice or oil-covered stone                                                  \\
            \end{dtabularx}
            1 These modifiers are cumulative with modifiers of different kinds. Use any that apply (but not if one modifier is just a more extreme version of another).
        \end{dtable}

        \parhead{Climbing Distractions}
        If you take damage while climbing, suddenly acquire significantly more weight (such as by catching a falling character), or otherwise are significantly distracted, you must make another Climb check against the wall's \glossterm{difficulty rating} to avoid falling.

        \parhead{Climb Speed}\label{Climb Speed}
            A creature with a climb speed can move a distance equal to its climb speed with a successful Climb check.
            However, it does not move double its speed if it gets a critical success on a Climb check.

    \subsubsection{Grab Edge}\label{Grab Edge}
        If you are next to the edge of a wall or cliff, you can grab it.
        Grabbing an edge is done as part of other movement, and does not take an action in itself.
        The \glossterm{difficulty rating} of the check depends on the nature of the edge, but a typical stone or similarly solid edge has a \glossterm{difficulty rating} of 5.
        You can pull yourself up from a grabbed edge as a \glossterm{move action} that requires a Climb check against the edge's \glossterm{difficulty rating}\@.

        Your ability to grab an edge depends on your reach. The maximum vertical reach (height the creature can reach without jumping) for an average creature of a given size is shown on the table below. (As a Medium creature, a typical human can reach 8 feet without jumping.) The maximum vertical reach for an individual creature is usually given by the 1 and 1/2 times the creature's height. Quadrupedal creatures don't have the same vertical reach as a bipedal creature; treat them as being one size category smaller.

        \begin{dtable}
            \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{>{\lcol}X >{\lcol}X}
                \tb{Creature Size} & \tb{Vertical Reach} \tableheaderrule
                Fine               & 1/2 ft. \\
                Diminutive         & 1 ft.   \\
                Tiny               & 2 ft.   \\
                Small              & 4 ft.   \\
                Medium             & 8 ft.   \\
                Large              & 16 ft.  \\
                Huge               & 32 ft.  \\
                Gargantuan         & 64 ft.  \\
                Colossal           & 128 ft. \\
            \end{dtabularx}
        \end{dtable}

        If you can't reach an edge, you can jump to grab it (see \pcref{Leap}).

    \subsection{Stop Fall}\label{Stop Fall}
        It is possible, but difficult, to make a Climb check to stop yourself from falling when near a wall. To catch yourself while falling, make a Climb check against a \glossterm{difficulty rating} equal to the wall's \glossterm{difficulty rating} \add 10.

    \subsection{Wallrun}\label{Wallrun}
        As part of movement, you can make a Climb check to run along a wall rather than climbing it. The \glossterm{difficulty rating} is 5 higher than normal for the wall, but this does not require free hands. Success means you move up to half your land speed horizontally, or up to a quarter of your land speed vertically. Failure means you fall. Critical failure means you are prone when you land. For every round you spend running on a wall, the \glossterm{difficulty rating} increases by 5.

        Wallrunning on a ceiling is impossible.

    \subsection{Creature Climb}
        As a standard action, you can make an attack vs. Reflex against a creature adjacent to you.
        Your \glossterm{accuracy} is equal to your Climb skill.
        The creature must be three or more size categories larger than you.
        Success means you can climb the creature as if it were a solid object with a Climb \glossterm{difficulty rating} equal to its Reflex defense.
        The creature takes a \minus4 penalty to \glossterm{accuracy} with \glossterm{mundane} attacks against you, but is not otherwise encumbered by your presence unless it cannot support your weight.
        It can attempt to remove you by dealing damage to you or with an appropriate ability, such as the \textit{shove} ability (see \pcref{Shove}).

\newpage
\skill{Craft}{Int}
    Like Knowledge, Perform, and Profession, Craft is actually a number of separate skills.
    You could have several Craft skills, each with a separate degree of training.
    Common Craft skills are listed below, with additional description for some skills.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Alchemy (Alchemist's fire, tanglefoot bags, potions)
        \item Bone
        \item Ceramics (Glass, pottery)
        \item Jewelry (gemcutting, amulets, rings)
        \item Leather
        \item Manuscripts (Books, official documents, scrolls)
        \item Metal
        \item Poison
        \item Stone
        \item Textiles (Cloth, fabric)
        \item Traps
        \item Wood
    \end{itemize}

    % TODO: note which skills often have magic items?

    A Craft skill is specifically focused on physical objects. If nothing can be created by an endeavor, it probably falls under the heading of a Profession skill. Complex structures, such as buildings or siege engines, may require Knowledge (engineering) in addition to an appropriate Craft skill.

    \subsection{Create Item}
        You can use the Craft skill to create an item by expending time and material components. Creating an item often requires multiple consecutive Craft checks. Success on a check means you make progress on completing the item. If you make enough progress, you complete the item. Failure means you failed to make progress, but can try again without penalty. Critical failure means you botched the item, and negating all progress and ruining half of the material components. You can start again from scratch with your remaining components.

        Each item takes a certain amount of working time to craft, as shown on \tref{Crafting Time}, and the expenditure of one quarter of the item's price in raw materials. In order to craft an item, you must make a Craft check against the item's Craft \glossterm{difficulty rating}, as shown on \trefnp{Craft Difficulty Ratings}. If you succeed, you make progress on the item based on how long you spend crafting. For every 5 points by which you beat the Craft check, you accomplish twice as much work in the same amount of time. Once your total effective working time exceeds the time required to craft the item, you have finished the item.

        All crafts require artisan's tools to give the best chance of success. If improvised tools are used, the check may be made with a penalty, or may be impossible, depending on the tools available and the item to be crafted. For example, crafting a bow with improvised woodworking tools would impose a \minus5 penalty, but cutting a diamond without specialized tools is impossible. Note that raw materials for some items, particularly alchemical items, may be hard to come by in some areas. A typical day's work consists of 8 hours of work.

        To determine the time required to craft an item, consult the table below.
        \begin{dtable}

            \end{dtabularx}

        \end{dtable}

    \subsection{Appraise Item}
        You can make a Craft check to estimate the value of an item with 1 minute of careful study. The Craft skill used must be related to the item.

        The \glossterm{difficulty rating} depends on the rarity of the item. Common items, such as nonmagical equipment and utensils, are \glossterm{difficulty rating} 5. Rare items, such as valuable gems and magic items worth less than 100,000 gp, are \glossterm{difficulty rating} 10. Extraordinarily rare items, such as unique gems and magic items worth at least 100,000 gp, are \glossterm{difficulty rating} 20.

        Success means you know the value of the item. Failure means you think the item is worth (d10 \add 5)/10 \x the item's actual value. (The d10 roll is made secretly, so you don't know how close you are.) Critical failure means you can't estimate the item's value at all.

        After you appraise an item, you can't appraise it again with any skill until you gain a level.

    \subsection{Create Forgery}
        You can use the Craft skill to create false or defective versions of objects. For example, you may wish to forge official-looking documents with Craft (manuscripts), or you may need to make items in a rush to satisfy an employer. This functions like crafting the item from scratch, except that the Craft \glossterm{difficulty rating} is 5 lower than normal, and you use one-half the item's price to determine the price of raw materials and the crafting time.

        Forgeries which have a function, such as a weapon, are always defective in some way which makes them unsuitable for use. A forgery can be detected with the Identify Forgery uses of the Craft and Awareness skills.

    \subsection{Identify Forgery}
        As a standard action, you can make a Craft check to evaluate whether an item is a forgery. The \glossterm{difficulty rating} to identify a forgery is equal to the Craft check used to make the item. Success means you correctly identify whether the item is a forgery or not. Failure means you are unsure. Critical failure means you randomly identify the item as genuine or forged. The check is made secretly, so you can't be sure how good the result is.

    \subsection{Repair Item}
        You can make a Craft check to repair a broken item. This functions like crafting the item from scratch, except that you use one-tenth of the item's price to determine the price of raw materials and the crafting time.

    \subsection{Other Tasks}
        You can use the Craft skill for various tasks related to the object of your craft. For example, you could use Craft (wood) to sabotage a wagon so it will break at a later time, or Craft (alchemy) to purify spoiled food or ingredients. The \glossterm{difficulty ratings} of such tasks, and what can be accomplished, can vary widely. In general, the more difficult the task, and the more loosely it is related to the skill, the higher the \glossterm{difficulty rating}.

\newpage
\skill{Creature Handling}{Per}
    The Creature Handling skill represents your ability to handle creatures without being able to speak with them. With it, you can convince them to do what you want or train them to follow commands. This skill can only be used with creatures with an Intelligence of \minus6 or lower.

        Animals are easier to handle than other kinds of creatures.
        The \glossterm{difficulty ratings} listed are for animals; the \glossterm{difficulty ratings} to handle other kinds of creatures are 5 higher.

    \subsection{Handling Creatures}
        You can use Creature Handling to control a creature's actions using these abilities.
        Critical failure with these abilities may make the target hostile, depending on the circumstances.

        As a standard action, you can use the \textit{command} ability to control the actions of a creature.

        \begin{freeability}{\labeltext{Command}}[\glossterm{Auditory}, \glossterm{Compulsion}, \glossterm{Sustain (standard)}]
            Make an attack vs. Mental against a creature within \rngmed range.
            Your \glossterm{accuracy} is equal to your Creature Handling skill.
            In addition, choose and state an action that the creature could take.
            \hit The target is unable to take any actions except to use the \textit{recover} ability (see \pcref{Recover}).
            \crit The target performs the chosen action if it is physically capable of performing it.
            This can include convincing creatures to perform forced marches and similar activities (see \pcref{Overland Exertion}).
            
            The target's defense is increased if it is not an animal, as normal for Creature Handling attacks and checks.
            You take a \minus10 penalty to accuracy against an actively hostile target.
            If the target is damaged or feels that it is in danger, this effect is automatically ended.
        \end{freeability}

        As a \glossterm{free action}, you can use the \textit{perform trained action} ability to convince a creature to perform an action it knows.

        \begin{freeability}{Perform Trained Action}
            Make a \glossterm{difficulty rating} 5 Creature Handling check on an \glossterm{ally} within \rnglong range and choose an action that creature could take.
            If you succeed, the target performs the chosen action if it is trained to perform it.
            Generally, wild animals are not trained in any actions, so this is not effective on them.
        \end{freeability}

    \subsection{Training Creatures}\label{Training Creatures}
        You can use Creature Handling to train a creature. Success means the creature learns a trick or becomes domesticated. Failure means your time is wasted, and you must try again. Exceptional failure may indicate that the animal becomes unable to learn the trick, becomes hostile, or other consequences depending on the situation. Training a creature takes a week or more; this requires spending at least four hours each day with the creature. It is not generally possible to accelerate the process by spending more time each day; the creature must take time to learn the new behavior. If the training is interrupted for a week or more, the attempt automatically fails.

        \parhead{Teach a Trick} You can teach a creature a specific trick with one week of work and a successful Creature Handling check against the indicated \glossterm{difficulty rating}. A creature can learn two tricks per point of Intelligence it has above \minus10. Thus, a creature with an Intelligence of \minus9 can learn two tricks, while a creature with an Intelligence of \minus5 can learn ten tricks. Possible tricks (and their associated \glossterm{difficulty ratings}) include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following.

        \subsk{Attack (\glossterm{difficulty rating} 10)} The creature attacks apparent enemies. You may point to a particular creature that you wish the creature to attack, and it will comply if able. Normally, a creature will attack only humanoids, monstrous humanoids, giants, or other creatures. Teaching a creature to attack all creatures (including such unnatural creatures as undead and aberrations) counts as two tricks.
        \subsk{Come (\glossterm{difficulty rating} 5)} The creature comes to you, even if it normally would not do so.
        \subsk{Defend (\glossterm{difficulty rating} 10)} The creature defends you (or is ready to defend you if no threat is present), even without any command being given. Alternatively, you can command the creature to defend a specific other character.
        \subsk{Down (\glossterm{difficulty rating} 5)} The creature breaks off from combat or otherwise backs down. A creature that doesn't know this trick continues to fight until it must flee (due to injury, a fear effect, or the like) or its opponent is defeated.
        \subsk{Fetch (\glossterm{difficulty rating} 5)} The creature goes and gets something. If you do not point out a specific item, the creature fetches some random object.
        \subsk{Guard (\glossterm{difficulty rating} 10)} The creature stays in place and prevents others from approaching.
        \subsk{Heel (\glossterm{difficulty rating} 5)} The creature follows you closely, even to places where it normally wouldn't go.
        \subsk{Messenger (\glossterm{difficulty rating} 15)} The creature carries a small item to a destination.
        Once it arrives, it waits for up to 24 hours for someone to take the item from it.
        The destination must be known to the creature.
        \par When you instruct the creature to deliver the item, you must communicate the destination to the creature.
        This normally requires a \glossterm{difficulty rating} 20 Creature Handling check as a standard action.
        The \glossterm{difficulty rating} of this check is lowered to 15 for locations the creature is extremely familiar with, such as its home.
        If you have other means of communicating the destination to the creature, such as the \textit{animal speech} druid ability (see Animal Speech, page \pref{Drd:Animal Speech}), that check is unnecessary.
        \subsk{Perform (\glossterm{difficulty rating} 10)} The creature performs a variety of simple tricks, such as sitting up, rolling over, roaring or barking, and so on.
        \subsk{Seek (\glossterm{difficulty rating} 5)} The creature moves into an area and looks around for anything that is obviously alive or animate.
        \subsk{Stay (\glossterm{difficulty rating} 5)} The creature stays in place, waiting for you to return. It does not challenge other creatures that come by, though it still defends itself if it needs to.
        \subsk{Track (\glossterm{difficulty rating} 10)} The creature tracks the scent presented to it. (This requires the creature to have the scent ability)
        \subsk{Work (\glossterm{difficulty rating} 5)} The creature pulls or pushes a medium or heavy load.

        \parhead{Rear a Wild Creature} To rear a creature means to raise a wild creature from infancy so that it becomes domesticated. The time required depends on the creature in question. The \glossterm{difficulty rating} for this check is equal to 5 \add the number of levels the creature has. You can rear as many as three creatures of the same kind at once without penalty. You can rear additional creatures, but you take a cumulative \minus2 penalty to checks you make to rear all of the animals. A successfully domesticated creature can be taught tricks at the same time it's being raised, or it can be taught as a domesticated creature later.

        \parhead{Bonus Tricks}\label{Bonus Tricks} Some trainers can teach creatures bonus tricks in addition to their normal maximum number of tricks known.
        Once a creature has learned a bonus trick, that trick may not be retrained into a different trick by any trainer without the same ability to grant bonus tricks.
        However, any trainer may untrain the trick.

\newpage
\skill{Deduction}{Int}
    You can use the Deduction skill to make logical deductions based on evidence.
    It includes both determining which facts and observations are relevant to use as evidence, and reaching conclusions based on that evidence.
    However, this skill cannot protect you from coming to inaccurate conclusions if you rely on inaccurate or incomplete facts and observations.

    \subsection{Analyze Evidence}
        As a standard action, you can make use the \textit{analyze evidence} ability.
        \begin{freeability}{Analyze Evidence}
            Make a Deduction check to analyze evidence available to you and try to reach an accurate conclusion.
            This includes both determining which evidence is relevant and deciding what that evidence proves.
            Most deductions have two components: observations you make, and knowledge you have.
            When you use this ability, you can decide to trust your own observations, your own knowledge, or both.

            If you trust your own observations, and the deduction requires making observations, your Deduction modifier on the check is limited to be no greater than your modifier with the skill used to make observations.
            This skill is typically Awareness or Social Insight.
            If you trust your own knowledge, and the deduction requires knowledge, your Deduction modifier on the check is limited to be no greater than twice your Knowledge modifier with any relevant knowledge.
            If you trust both your observations and your knowledge, both limits apply.

            Alternately, you can explicitly specify either the observations or knowledge your deduction is relying on.
            For example, you could make a deduction based on information given to you by another creature.
            If you do, your Deduction check is not limited, but your conclusions may be inaccurate if your assumptions are inaccurate.

            The base \glossterm{difficulty rating} for this check is 10.
            This \glossterm{difficulty rating} is modified depending on the difficulty of the deduction and the quality of the evidence available to you, as shown on \trefnp{Deduction Difficulty Modifiers}.
        \end{freeability}

\newpage
\skill{Devices}{Int}
        You can use the Devices skill to manipulate mechanical devices such as locks, traps, and other contraptions. With enough skill, you can even manipulate magical devices.

        The \glossterm{difficulty rating} of a Devices check depends on the device being manipulated. In addition, some actions are easier than others, and modify the \glossterm{difficulty rating} accordingly. \glossterm{Difficulty ratings} are listed on \trefnp{Devices Difficulty Ratings}.

        \begin{dtable}

        \end{dtable}

    \parhead{Special Circumstances}

        You can attempt to leave no trace of your tampering while making a Devices check to activate or subvert a device. This increases the Devices \glossterm{difficulty rating} by 5, but increases the Awareness \glossterm{difficulty rating} to notice the tampering by 10.

    \subsection{Activate Device}
        As a standard action, you can make a Devices check to make a device perform a function it was designed to do, even if you lack the normal requirements. For example, you could tie or untie a knot, apply a poison, lock or unlock a lock without its key, or activate a trap without using its normal triggering mechanism (hopefully without being in its line of fire).

    \subsection{Analyze Device}
        As a standard action, you can evaluate a device to understand how it functions. The \glossterm{difficulty rating} is 10 lower than normal. Success grants you an insight into the device's mechanisms. For every 5 points by which you succeed, you glean additional information about the device, which can also help you estimate the device's true difficulty. Failure means you learn nothing about the device.

    \subsection{Break Device}
        As a standard action, you can make a Devices check to break a device. The \glossterm{difficulty rating} is 5 lower than normal. This is generally not subtle, such as jamming a lock or breaking a trap while triggering it in the process. It cannot change the state of a device, but you can prevent it from being used normally; a locked door will remain locked, but you can prevent it from being unlocked with its key. Failure means the device continues to function. Critical failure may cause you to think that you successfully broke the device, while in fact it functions normally.

    \subsection{Create Bindings}
        As a standard action, you can make a Devices check to tie a knot or create a binding, including binding a helpless foe. The \glossterm{difficulty rating} to escape the binding is equal to your check result.

    \subsection{Improvise}\label{Improvise}
        You can construct ad-hoc devices from available materials.
        It takes five minutes to make a device of up to Tiny size.
        You can make a Small device in the time required to make two Tiny devices, a Medium device in the time required to make two Small devices, and so on.
        You make a Devices check against the \glossterm{difficulty rating} required to craft the item normally.
        Success means you create a device that lasts long enough for a single use before breaking.
        For every 5 points by which you succeed, the device lasts for an additional use.

        Normally, you must have materials at hand which are designed for the construction of the device.
        You can jury-rig devices together from inappropriate materials by increasing the \glossterm{difficulty rating} by 10.
        The materials do not have to be well-suited to the device's construction, but they must be physically capable of performing any necessary actions.
        For example, you could construct a simple arrow-throwing trap from bent sticks or creatively strung rope, but not from sand.
        Especially appropriate or inappropriate materials may decrease or further increase the \glossterm{difficulty rating}.

    \subsection{Subvert Device}
        As a standard action, you can make a Devices check to subvert the normal functionality of a device. The \glossterm{difficulty rating} is 5 higher than normal. This could allow you to sabotage a hinge or lock so it breaks once it is used, disable a trap without triggering it, or disable a lock so it is perpetually closed or open. Failure means you were unsuccessful, and your action was wasted. Critical failure means you break the device immediately, think you sabotaged the device when you did not, or activate the trap, depending on the circumstances.

        Once you have disabled a device, you can attempt to recover it for later use if you can carry it. This requires a separate Devices check to subvert the device. The \glossterm{difficulty rating} is 5 higher than normal, as usual for a check to subvert a device.

\newpage
\skill{Disguise}{Int}
        The Disguise skill represents your ability to create disguises to conceal the appearance of creatures or objects. This skill does not help you act appropriately while disguised; see Perform (acting) and Deception.

    \subsection{Conceal Object}
        As a standard action, you can make a Disguise check to conceal a creature or object on your person.
        The target must be at least two size categories smaller than you are.
        A creature must be an \glossterm{ally}, and an object must be unattended.

        Your Disguise check is opposed by the Awareness check of anyone observing you.
        Success means they fail to notice the item. A creature directly interacting you to search for the object, such as by frisking you, gains a \plus5 bonus to its Awareness check.

    \subsection{Disguise Creature}\label{Disguise Creature}
        You can make a Disguise check to change the appearance of a creature using makeup, costumes, and so forth. An observer can perceive the presence of a disguise with a Disguise or Awareness check to identify a disguise that is higher than your Disguise check. The effectiveness of a disguise depends in part on how much you're attempting to change the creature's appearance, as shown on the table below. The modifiers are cumulative; use any that apply.

        The Disguise check is made secretly, so that you can't be sure how good the result is. However, you can attempt to judge its effectiveness with an identify disguise check using either Disguise or Awareness.

        \parhead{Creation Time} Creating a disguise takes 30 minutes. You can take a \minus5 penalty to reduce the time to 5 minutes, a \minus10 penalty to reduce the time to 5 rounds, or a \minus15 penalty to reduce the time to a \glossterm{standard action}.

        \begin{dtable}
            \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{l >{\ccol}X}

            \end{dtabularx}
            1 Per step of difference between your actual age category and your
            disguised age category. The steps are: young, adulthood, middle age, old, and venerable. \\
            2 Per limb. You must have suitable disguise materials available. \\
            3 You cannot disguise yourself as a different size category.
        \end{dtable}

    \subsection{Emulate Creature}
        You can make a Disguise check to make a creature look like another creature you have previously observed. This functions like the \textit{disguise creature} ability, but the result of your Disguise check can't exceed the result of an Awareness check you have made to observe the creature. People viewing the disguise who know what that person looks like get a \plus5 bonus on their checks to identify the disguise.

    \subsection{Identify Disguise [Hidden]}
        When you observe a disguised creature or object, you can make an Disguise check to identify the disguise.
        The \glossterm{difficulty rating} is equal to the Disguise check result used to create the disguise.
        Success means you know that the creature or object is disguised.
        Critical success means you can also discern its true appearance beneath the disguise.
        Failure means you don't notice anything unusual.

        You cannot retry this check until you gain meaningful new information that would help you identify the disguise.

\newpage
\skill{Endurance}{Con}
    The Endurance skill represents your ability to perservere through physical trials.

    \subsection{Hold Breath}\label{Hold Breath}
        You can hold your breath for up to 5 rounds without making an Endurance check.
        After that time, you must make an Endurance check at the end of each round.
        The \glossterm{difficulty rating} starts at 5, and increases by 5 in each subsequent round.
        If you succeed, you continue holding your breath.
        If you fail, you stop holding your breath and try to breathe in air.
        If there is no air to breathe, you gain a \glossterm{vital wound} and must continue making this check in subsequent rounds.

    \subsubsection{Overland Exertion}\label{Overland Exertion}
        You can exert yourself while travelling overland to cover more ground (see \pcref{Overland Movement}).
        You can hustle, which allows you to travel twice the normal distance in the same time.
        You can also make a forced march, which allows you to travel for a longer period of time during the day.
        Exerting yourself for an hour in between \glossterm{long rests} requires a \glossterm{difficulty rating} 5 Endurance check.
        The \glossterm{difficulty rating} increases by 2 for every hour you spend exerting yourself.
        Success means you suffer no penalty for the exertion.
        Failure means you take a \glossterm{vital wound} from \glossterm{subdual damage}.

        If you combine both forms of exertion, you increase the \glossterm{difficulty rating} of the check by 4 for that hour instead of by 2.

    \subsection{Stay Awake}\label{Stay Awake}
        A typical creature needs a minimum of 6 hours of sleep for every 18 hours spent awake, and a minimum of 50 hours of sleep every week.
        If you try to stay awake beyond those limits, you must make an Endurance check.
        The \glossterm{difficulty rating} starts at 5, and increases by 5 for each subsequent check.
        If you succeed, you stay awake without suffering any penalties.
        If you fail, you gain a \glossterm{vital wound} from \glossterm{subdual damage}.
        You must make another check every 8 hours as long as you are still beyond your normal sleep limits.

\newpage
\skill{Flexibility}{Dex}
        The Flexibility skill represents your ability to escape bindings and move through small areas by contorting your body.

    \subsection{Escape Bindings}
        As a standard action, you can make an Flexibility check to escape bindings and restraints. The \glossterm{difficulty ratings} of various restraints are given on the table below.

        \begin{dtable}
            \lcaption{Flexibility Difficulty Ratings}

                \spell{Entangle} and similar spells & Spellcaster's attack result       \\
            \end{dtabularx}
        \end{dtable}

    \subsection{Tight Squeeze}
        As a standard action, you can use the \textit{tight squeeze} ability to squeeze into spaces too small to normally fit you.
        \begin{freeability}{Tight Squeeze}
            Make an Flexibility check to move one foot forward into a tight space.
            A \glossterm{difficulty rating} 15 check allows you to move in a space that can fit your head and shoulders, but which is too tight to allow normal crawling.
            A \glossterm{difficulty rating} 20 check allows you to move in a space that can fit your head, but not your shoulders.
            Success means you make progress through the space, while failure means your action is wasted.

            This functions like \glossterm{squeezing}, except that the penalties are increased to \minus8.
            If you are squeezing in a space that cannot fit your shoulders, you are also treated as \glossterm{helpless}.
        \end{freeability}

\newpage
\skill{Intimidate}{Varies}
        The Intimidate skill represents your ability to intimidate and coerce people into doing what you want.

        \parhead{Check Modifiers}
        You gain a bonus of up to \plus10 on Intimidate checks if the target thinks you or your group is stronger than it is, or that it is otherwise in some real danger from you.
        Likewise, you take a penalty of up to \minus10 if the target thinks you or your group is weaker than it is, or that there is otherwise no chance that you could cause it harm.

        \parhead{Choosing an Attribute}
        No attribute is a key attribute for Intimidate.
        However, depending on how you are trying to intimidate creatures, you can add any attribute's base value to your Intimidate check.
        For example, if you intimidate a creature by smashing a table and threatening to smash its head in, you can add your base Strength to the Intimidate check.
        On the other hand, if you intimidate a creature by staring it down in a cold fury, you can add your base Willpower to the Intimidate check.

    \subsection{Coerce}
        You can make an Intimidate check to convince a creature to do what you want. This functions like a Persuasion check to form an agreement with a group, except that you do not apply a relationship modifier. In addition, the \glossterm{difficulty rating} is up to 10 lower if the group thinks your group is significantly stronger than them, or up to 10 higher if the group thinks your group is significantly weaker.

    \subsection{Demoralize}\label{Demoralize}

        As a standard action, you can use the \textit{demoralize} ability to intimidate creatures in combat.

        \begin{freeability}{Demoralize}
            Make an attack vs. Mental against a creature within \rngmed range.
            Your \glossterm{accuracy} is equal to your Intimidate skill.
            \hit The target is \shaken by you until the end of the next round.
        \end{freeability}

\newpage
\skill{Jump}{Str}
        The Jump skill represents your ability to jump. All Jump checks are made as part of movement, so they take no special action to perform. Distance moved with Jump checks is counted against your normal maximum movement in a phase.

        Several modifiers apply to all Jump checks, which are described below.

        \parhead{Running Start}\label{Running Start} If you move at least twenty feet before jumping, you have a running start.
        Jumping without a running start is difficult.
        If you make a Jump attack or check without a running start, you roll twice and take the lower result.

    \subsection{Hop Up}
        You can make a \glossterm{difficulty rating} 5 Jump check while moving to jump up onto an object as tall as your waist, such as a table or small boulder. Doing so counts as 5 feet of movement. Success means you land on top of the object and can continue your movement. Failure indicates you stop your movement where you are. You do not need to get a running start to hop up.

    \subsection{Jump Down}
        You can make a \glossterm{difficulty rating} 5 Jump check while moving to intentionally jump down from a height to reduce your falling damage. Success means you take damage as if you had dropped 10 fewer feet than you actually did. Failure means you take the normal falling damage. You do not need to get a running start to hop up.

    \subsection{Leap}\label{Leap}
        As part of movement, you can make a Jump check to jump.
        You move forward any number of feet, up to a maximum equal to one quarter of your land speed \add your Jump check result.
        Your maximum height must be no greater than half of your Jump check result, and at least equal to a quarter of your forward distance travelled.
        For example, if you have a land speed of 30 feet and you get a Jump check result of 20, you can move forward a maximum of 25 feet.
        If you instead jump forward twenty feet, your maximum height must be between 5 and 10 feet.

        You always reach your maximum height at the midpoint of the jump.
        However, you can interrupt your leap before travelling the full horizontal distance.
        For example, if you need to travel five feet forward and five feet vertically to reach a rope, you can start a leap which would take you ten feet forward and reach a maximum height of five feet.
        Making such a leap would require a Jump check result of 10.
        When you reach the rope, you can stop your movement there, ignoring the forward motion which would make you travel the full ten feet.

        When leaping, your movement may not stopped by hitting the ground after travelling the normal distance, such as if you jump off of a ledge.
        In that case, you move one quarter of your jump distance farther forward as you fall before your fall becomes entirely downward.
        If an insufficiently long jump would cause you to fall into a gap, you can attempt to stop your fall (see \pcref{Stop Fall}) if you can reach the wall.

    \subsection{Rebounding Leap}\label{Rebounding Leap}
        While in midair, if you make contact with a solid object that can support your weight, you can jump off of that object, as the \textit{leap} ability.
        You are not considered to have a running start.
        In addition, you take a \minus5 penalty to the check (in addition to the penalty for not having a running start), because rebounding off of an object in midair is difficult.
        You must travel at least 10 feet in the air between each rebounding jump.

\skill{Knowledge}{Int}
        Like the Craft, Profession, and Perform skills, Knowledge actually encompasses a number of separate skills. Knowledge represents a study of some body of lore, possibly an academic or even scientific discipline. Below are listed typical fields of study.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Arcana (ancient mysteries, magic traditions, arcane symbols,
                cryptic phrases, constructs, dragons, magical beasts)
            \item Engineering (architecture, buildings, bridges, fortifications, siege weapons)
            \item Dungeoneering (aberrations, caverns, oozes, spelunking, subterranean monsters)
            \item Geography (lands, terrain, climate, people, outdoor monsters)
            \item Local (humanoids, legends, inhabitants, laws, customs, history, nobility, royalty)
            \item Nature (animals, fey, giants, monstrous humanoids, plants, seasons and cycles, weather, vermin)
            \item Planes (the Primal Planes, the Aligned Planes, the Astral Plane,
                outsiders, elementals, magic related to the planes, extraplanar monsters)
            \item Religion (gods and goddesses, mythic history, ecclesiastic tradition, holy symbols, undead)
        \end{itemize}

        You cannot retry Knowledge checks until you are presented with significant new information about the subject that could jog your memory.

    \subsection{Identify Monster}
        You can make a Knowledge check reactively to identify a monster and recall its special powers or vulnerabilities.
        In general, the \glossterm{difficulty rating} is equal to 5 \add the monster's level.

        Success allows you to remember the monster's name and its most well-known features, as indicated in the monster's description.
        In addition, you remember one piece of useful information.
        For every 5 points by which you succeed, you remember an additional piece of useful information, in addition to any context about the monster from its description.
        You can choose each piece of useful information from the following standard pieces of information:
        % TODO: should you be able to remember darkvision here? If so, how?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Alignment
            \item All languages the creature typically knows, if any
            \item Approximate level, to the nearest increment of 3 (0, 3, 6, 9, and so on)
            \item Approximate speed, to the nearest increment of 10 feet
            \item Approximate value for any one of its attributes, to the nearest increment of 5
            \item Challenge rating (see \pcref{Challenge Rating})
            \item Highest defense
            \item Lowest defense
        \end{itemize}

        Failure indicates you don't remember anything important about the monster.
        Critical failure may mean you remember incorrect information.

        Some particularly famous monsters have legends about them that are much easier to recall than specific combat details about them.
        For example, even the most rural commoner has heard of dragons.

    \subsection{Answer Question/Recall Information}
        You can make a Knowledge check reactively to remember information related to your field of study. The \glossterm{difficulty rating} varies depending on the difficulty of the question. Answering a simple or trivial question that most students would be familiar with is \glossterm{difficulty rating} 5. Answering a challenging question which would be beyond the reach of most initiates is R 15. Answering a deeply complex or obscure question which might require information known only by the most learned masters in the field would be \glossterm{difficulty rating} 20 or higher.

    \subsection{Appraise Item}
        You can make a Knowledge check to estimate the value of an item with 1 minute of careful study. The Knowledge skill used must be related to the item.

        The \glossterm{difficulty rating} depends on the rarity of the item. Common items, such as nonmagical equipment and utensils, are \glossterm{difficulty rating} 5. Rare items, such as valuable gems and magic items worth less than 100,000 gp, are \glossterm{difficulty rating} 10. Extraordinarily rare items, such as unique gems and magic items worth at least 100,000 gp, are \glossterm{difficulty rating} 20.

        Success means you know the value of the item. Failure means you think the item is worth (d10 \add 5)/10 \x the item's actual value. (The d10 roll is made secretly, so you don't know how close you are.) Critical failure means you can't estimate the item's value at all.

        After you appraise an item, you can't appraise it again with any skill until you gain a level.

\newpage
\skill{Linguistics}{Int}
        The Linguistics skill represents your mastery of spoken and written languages (see \pcref{Languages}).
        Normally, you don't make Linguistics checks to speak or understand languages.
        You either know a language or you don't.
        However, training in Linguistics causes you to learn additional languages, and you can use Linguistics to attempt to decipher unfamiliar languages.

        \parhead{Learning Languages}\label{Learning Languages}
        If you are trained in Linguistics, you learn additional \glossterm{common languages} equal to one plus one quarter of your level (see \tref{Common Languages}).
        If you have mastered Linguistics, you instead learn additional common languages equal to two plus half your level.
        In place of two common languages, you may instead learn a \glossterm{rare language} (see \tref{Rare Languages}).
        Rare languages are more difficult to learn, and are usually only spoken by unusual creatures.

    \subsection{Decipher Script}
        You can make a Linguistics check to decipher writing in an unfamiliar language or a message written in an incomplete or archaic form. The base \glossterm{difficulty rating} is 10 for the simplest messages, 15 for standard texts, and 20 or higher for intricate, exotic, or very old writing. In addition, the \glossterm{difficulty rating} increases by 5 if you do not know any languages that use the same alphabet as the writing being deciphered. Deciphering the equivalent of a single page of script takes 1 minute.

        Success means you understand the general content of a piece of writing about one page long (or the equivalent). Failure means you fail to understand the writing. Critical failure means you to draw a false conclusion about the text. The check to decipher the writing is made secretly, so that you can't tell whether the conclusion you draw is true or false.

    \subsection{Identify Language}
        You make a \glossterm{difficulty rating} 10 Linguistics check to identify the language used in speech or writing, even if you can't understand the language.
        For details about languages, see \pcref{Languages}.

\newpage
\skill{Medicine}{Int}
        The Medicine skill allows you to tend to the injuries and afflictions of others.
        In order to use this skill to aid a creature, you must be able to see and touch it.

    \subsection{Accelerate Recovery}\label{Accelerate Recovery}
        You can make a \glossterm{difficulty rating} 10 Medicine check to accelerate the recovery of up to four willing creatures during a \glossterm{long rest}.
        Success means that each creature gains an additional \plus5 bonus to one of its \glossterm{vital rolls}, as if it had taken an additional long rest (see \pcref{Removing Vital Wounds}).
        For every 10 points by which you succeed, each creature gets an additional \plus5 bonus.

        To accelerate a creature's recovery, you need a few items and supplies (bandages, salves, and so on) that are easy to come by in civilized areas.
        You can accelerate the recovery of additional creatures during the same rest by taking a cumulative \minus2 penalty per additional creature.

    \subsection{First Aid}\label{First Aid}
        As a standard action, you can make a Medicine check to prevent a willing creature from dying from a \glossterm{vital wound} with a negative \glossterm{vital roll}.
        The \glossterm{difficulty rating} is equal to 0 \add 10 for each point by which the vital roll is below 1.
        Success means that the target treats the \glossterm{vital roll} as a 1 instead of its original value.
        This changes the effect of the vital wound, generally preventing the target from dying.
        For details, see \pcref{Vital Wounds}.

    \subsection{Treat Condition}\label{Treat Condition}
        As a standard action, you can make a Medicine check to treat some specific conditions.
        Success usually means the condition is gone, as indicated by the effect's description.
        A condition cannot be removed by this ability unless says this ability can remove it.

    \subsection{Treat Poison or Disease}
        You can make a Medicine check to treat poison or disease in a character.
        To resist the next attack by the poison or disease, it can use your Medicine check or its Fortitude defense, whichever is higher.
        Treating a poison takes a standard action. Treating a disease takes five minutes of work.

\newpage
\skill{Perform}{Varies}
        \par Like Craft, Knowledge, and Profession, Perform is actually a number of separate skills.
        You could have several Perform skills, each with a separate degree of training.
        Each of the nine categories of the Perform skill includes a variety of methods, instruments, or techniques, a small list of which is provided for each category below.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Acting (drama, impersonation, mime)
            \item Comedy (buffoonery, limericks, joke-telling)
            \item Dance (ballet, waltz, jig)
            \item Keyboard instruments (harpsichord, piano, pipe organ)
            \item Oratory (epic, ode, storytelling)
            \item Percussion instruments (bells, chimes, drums, gong)
            \item Singing (ballad, chant, melody)
            \item String instruments (fiddle, harp, lute, mandolin)
            \item Wind instruments (flute, pan pipes, recorder, shawm, trumpet)
        \end{itemize}

        \parhead{Choosing an Attribute}
        No attribute is a key attribute for Perform.
        However, depending on how you are trying to perform creatures, you can add any attribute's base value to your Perform check.
        For example, if you create a complex and challenging tune on a harp, you can add your base Dexterity to the Perform check.
        On the other hand, if you issue a bombastic series of trumpet blasts, you can add your base Constitution to the Perform check.

        \parhead{Performance Types}
        In general, there are three types of performances: instrumental performances, visual performances, and vocal performances.
        \subparhead{Instrumental Performances} These performances require an instrument of some sort to create sound, which always requires at least one hand to manipulate the instrument.
        They affect all creatures who can hear the performance.
        \subparhead{Visual Performances} These performances require some sort of motion, such as juggling.
        They affect all creatures who can see the performance.
        \subparhead{Vocal Performances} These performances use your voice to create sound.
        These are simpler to create than instrumental performances, since they don't require an instrument.
        However, vocal performances are always in a particular language.
        They affect all creatures who can hear the performance and understand the language the performance is in.

        \parhead{Limitations while Performing}
        While you are performing, your actions are slightly limited.
        You cannot cast spells or take other actions requiring similar levels of focus and concentration.
        In addition, you take a \minus10 penalty to the Perform skill for any other performances.
        This penalty stacks.
        For example, if you were playing a lyre, singing, and juggling balls with your feet, you would take a \minus10 penalty to your singing and a \minus20 penalty to your juggling.
        These limitations are in addition to any restrictions imposed by your method of performing, such as your hands being occupied playing an instrument.

        You can otherwise act normally while performing, including attacking in combat, if doing so is physically possible.

        \parhead{Performance Time}
        In general, you can maintain a performance for a number of minutes equal to 5 \add your Constitution.
        After that time, you must rest for 5 minutes before performing again.

    \subsection{Entertain}
        You can make a Perform check to provide entertainment or to show off your skills.

    \subsection{Earn Income}
        You can make a Perform check to practice your trade and make a decent living, earning about half your Perform check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated performance.

\newpage
\skill{Persuasion}{---}
        You can use the Persuasion skill to convince people to do or think what you want. Depending on how it is used, it represents a combination of verbal acuity, tact, argumentative ability, grace, etiquette, and personal magnetism. Using a Persuasion check usually takes at least a minute of sustained conversation.

        Persuasion checks are usually made against a group. For the purposes of a Persuasion check, a ``group'' consists of creatures who consider themselves to be \glossterm{allies} and who share similar information or backgrounds. For example, in a king's court, you cannot simply influence the king alone; his trusted advisors are also part of the same group. It is possible to influence one group without influencing another. For example, the king and his advisors may be unpersuaded, but the prince may find your arguments compelling. Groups can also consist of a single creature. The game master decides what the groups are.

        The base \glossterm{difficulty rating} for a Persuasion check against a group is equal to 5 \add the highest level of any character in the group or the highest Social Insight of any character in the group, whichever is higher.

        Not all social interactions require Persuasion checks. Much of the time, being extraordinarily persuasive is unnecessary, and creatures can be convinced with normal, inartful conversation and good reasoning. Persuasion checks should only be used when your personal persuasiveness matters.

    \subsection{Compel Belief}\label{Compel Belief}
        As part of conversation, you can make a Persuasion check to cause creatures to believe something you say. If you are lying, you must also make a Deception check to lie. Success means the group believes what you are saying is true. What they choose to do with that information is up to them, however. Failure means they do not believe you, but they do not react poorly; perhaps they simply want more verification. You may be able to try again, depending on their patience. Critical failure means the group reacts poorly, and you may have permanently damaged your credibility with them.

        Your check is modified by how believable your argument is, as well as whether the group has strong feelings about the truth of your story.

        \end{dtable}

    \subsection{Form Agreement}
        You can make a Persuasion check to convince a group to accept a deal you offer. This can be used to persuade the chamberlain to let you see the king, to negotiate peace between feuding barbarian tribes, or to convince the ogre mages that have captured you that they should ransom you back to your friends instead of twisting your limbs off one by one.

        Success means the group will fulfill their end of the deal. Of course, if you don't fulfill your part, they are likely to react poorly. Failure means they did not accept the deal, but they may propose an alternate arrangement, or you can propose another deal without penalty. Critical failure means that there is virtually no chance to reach an agreement, and the group may become hostile or take other steps to end the conversation. They may have been insulted by how unfair the deal was, or you may have made a critical verbal misstep.

        Your check is modified by your relationship with the group and how favorable the deal is.

                \tb{Risk vs. Reward Judgement (Persuasion)}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & \tb{Difficulty Modifier} \tableheaderrule
                Fantastic: The reward for accepting the deal is very worthwhile; the risk is either acceptable or extremely unlikely. The best-case scenario is a virtual guarantee. Example: An offer to pay 10gp for directions to the well-known local tavern.                                                  & \minus15 or more                                                   \\
                Good: The reward is good and the risk is minimal. The subject is very likely to profit from the deal. Example: An offer to pay someone twice their normal daily wage to spend their evening in a seedy tavern and later report on everyone they saw there.                  & \minus10                                                           \\
                Favorable: The reward is appealing, but there's risk involved. If all goes according to plan, though, the deal will end up benefiting the subject. Example: A request for a mercenary to aid the party in battle against a weak goblin tribe in return for a cut of the money and first pick of the magic items. & \minus5                                                            \\
                Even: The reward and risk more of less even out; or the deal involves neither reward nor risk. Example: A request for directions to a place that isn't a secret.                                                                                                                                                                     & \plus0 \\
                Unfavorable: The reward is not enough compared to the risk involved. Even if all goes according to plan, chances are it will end badly for the subject. Example: A request to free a prisoner the target is guarding for a small amount of money.                                                                 & \plus5                                                             \\
                Bad: The reward is poor and the risk is high. The subject is very likely to get the raw end of the deal. Example: A request for a mercenary to aid the party in battle against an fearsome dragon for a small cut of any non-magical treasure.                                                                    & \plus10                                                            \\
                Horrible: There is no conceivable way that the proposed plan could end up with the subject ahead or the worst-case scenario is guaranteed to occur. Example: An offer to trade a broken sword hilt for a shiny new longsword.                                                                                      & \plus15 or more                                                    \\

    \subsection{Gather Information}
        An evening's time, a few gold pieces for buying drinks and making friends, and a \glossterm{difficulty rating} 5 Persuasion check get you a general idea of a city's major news items, assuming there are no obvious reasons why the information would be withheld. The higher your check result, the better the information.

        If you want to find out about a specific rumor, or a specific item, or obtain a map, or do something else along those lines, the \glossterm{difficulty rating} for the check is generally at least 5.
        The difficulty depends on how widely known and shared the information you seek is.

\newpage
\skill{Profession}{Varies}
        Like Craft, Knowledge, and Perform, Profession is actually a number of separate skills.
        You could have several Profession skills, each with a separate degree of training.
        While a Craft skill represents ability in creating or making an item, a Profession skill represents an aptitude in a vocation requiring a broader range of less specific knowledge.
        Most commoners have some training in a Profession skill.

        \parhead{Choosing an Attribute}
        No attribute is a key attribute for Profession.
        However, depending on how you are using your Profession, you can add any attribute's base value to your Profession check.
        For example, if you use your experience as a farmer to harrow a field, you can add your base Strength to the Profession check.
        On the other hand, if you use your experience as a sailor to determine the right angle for sails in the current wind, you can add your base Perception to the Profession check.

    \subsection{Appraise Item}
        You can make a Profession check to estimate the value of an item with 1 minute of careful study. The Profession skill used must be related to the item.
        This check is always Intelligence-based, regardless of your profession.

        The \glossterm{difficulty rating} depends on the rarity of the item. Common items, such as nonmagical equipment and utensils, are \glossterm{difficulty rating} 5. Rare items, such as valuable gems and magic items worth less than 100,000 gp, are \glossterm{difficulty rating} 10. Extraordinarily rare items, such as unique gems and magic items worth at least 100,000 gp, are \glossterm{difficulty rating} 20.

        Success means you know the value of the item. Failure means you think the item is worth (d10 \add 5)/10 \x the item's actual value. (The d10 roll is made secretly, so you don't know how close you are.) Critical failure means you can't estimate the item's value at all.

        After you appraise an item, you can't appraise it again with any skill until you gain a level.

    \subsection{Earn Income}
        You can make a Profession check to practice your trade and make a decent living, earning about half your Profession check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the profession's daily tasks, how to supervise helpers, and how to handle common problems.

    \subsection{Perform Task}
        You can make a Profession check to perform some tasks related to your profession. This allows you to use Profession in place of other skills when it is appropriate. For example, a sailor could use Profession to tie common knots in place of Devices or Survival, or a farmer could use Profession to identify common animals and plants in place of Knowledge (nature). The \glossterm{difficulty rating} when using Profession may be higher than it would be to use the normal skill for the task.

\newpage
\skill{Ride}{Dex}
        The Ride skill allows you to ride horses and other mounts. Typical riding actions don't require checks. You can saddle, mount, ride, and dismount from a mount without a problem. However, some special actions require Ride checks. Some modifiers apply to all Ride checks, as described at \pcref{Ride Modifiers}.

    \subsection{Control Mount}
        When riding an \glossterm{ally} in combat that is not trained for battle, you must a \glossterm{difficulty rating} 10 Ride check as a \glossterm{move action} to control it. Success means it obeys your commands that round. Failure means it remains still and refuses to obey your commands until you make a successful check to control it. Critical failure means the mount acts of its own volition.

    \subsection{Fall}
        If you fall off your mount, or if your mount is downed in battle, you take damage from the fall.
        Falling off of a typical Large creature, such as a horse, deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage, while falling from larger creatures deals damage appropriate to the distance fallen.

    \subsection{Guide Mount}
        While riding an \glossterm{ally}, you must make a \glossterm{difficulty rating} 0 Ride check at the start of your turn to guide it with your knees. Success means it obeys your commands, and you can have both hands free to take other actions. Failure means you must use a hand to control the mount that round. Critical failure means the mount acts of its own volition. If you cannot use a hand to control the mount, you fall off the mount if it moves during your turn.

    \subsection{Leap}
        You can make a \glossterm{difficulty rating} 5 Ride check to stay on your mount as it jumps. This check is made as part of your mount's movement. Success means that you stay on the mount. Failure means you fall off your mount as it starts to jump.

    \subsection{Spur Mount}
        You can make a \glossterm{difficulty rating} 5 Ride check as a move action to get your mount to move faster. Success means it takes the \textit{sprint} action to move faster (see \pcref{Sprint}).
        Failure means your action was wasted.

    \subsection{Stay in Saddle}
        If you take damage or your mount rears or bolts unexpectedly, you must make a \glossterm{difficulty rating} 5 Ride check to stay in your saddle. This does not take an action. Success means you stay in your saddle. Failure means you fall off your mount.

    \subsection{Take Cover}
        You can make a \glossterm{difficulty rating} 10 Ride check as a move action to drop low and take \glossterm{cover} behind your mount. This requires the use of both your hands. Failure means you can't get low enough and gain no benefit from the action. Critical failure means you fall off your mount. You can leave this cover and resume your normal position as a move action that does not require a Ride check.

    \subsection{Ride Modifiers}\label{Ride Modifiers}
        If a mount is not trained as a mount, the \glossterm{difficulty rating} to ride it increases by 10.
        If it lacks a saddle and other riding gear, the \glossterm{difficulty rating} to ride it increases by 5. If it takes a standard action other than movement, such as attacking, the \glossterm{difficulty rating} to ride it that round increases by 5.

\newpage
\skill{Sleight of Hand}{Dex}

        The Sleight of Hand skill represents your ability to pick pockets, palm objects, and perform other feats of legerdemain.

        All Sleight of Hand checks apply a special modifier based on the size of the action taken or object affected, as shown on \trefnp{Sleight of Hand Difficulty Modifiers}.

        \begin{dtable}
            \lcaption{Sleight of Hand Difficulty Modifiers}
            \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{X l}
                \tb{Size}   & {Difficulty Modifier} \tableheaderrule

                Medium      & \plus8  \\
                Large       & \plus12 \\
                Huge        & \plus16 \\
                Gargantuan  & \plus20 \\
                Colossal    & \plus24 \\
            \end{dtabularx}
        \end{dtable}

    \subsection{Conceal Action}
        You can make a Sleight of Hand check to conceal an action you take, preventing observers from noticing that you took the action. You can conceal any physical action that only requires the use of your hands and arms. Your check is opposed by the Awareness check of any observers. Success means your action is unnoticed. Failure means they are able to notice your action normally.

        The space required to perform the action is the size of the action, and applies a bonus or penalty as noted above. For example, winking only requires moving your eye, so you gain a \plus8 bonus to conceal the action. Firing a longbow requires manipulating an object as large as you are, so you take a \minus8 penalty to conceal the action.

        Observers that you touch as part of the action gain a \plus10 bonus to their Awareness check. If you strike them hard, as with an attack, the bonus increases to a \plus20 bonus.

        If you successfully conceal an attack, the attack is treated as if it were an attack from an invisible creature. The target may be \unaware of the attack. If the target is hit, it can tell the direction the attack came from, but not that you made the attack.

        Nonhumanoid creatures without hands and arms may conceal actions using different parts of their body. Large movements can never be concealed with this ability; see the Stealth skill.

    \subsection{Conceal Object}
        You can make a Sleight of Hand check as a standard action to conceal an item on your person. The object must be at least two size categories smaller than you are. Your Sleight of Hand check is opposed by the Awareness check of anyone observing you. Success means they fail to notice the item. A creature directly interacting you to search for the object, such as by frisking you, gains a \plus5 bonus to its Awareness check.

    \subsection{Pickpocket}
        You can make a Sleight of Hand check as a standard action to steal an object from another creature. The object must be loose and accessible, such as in a pocket. The \glossterm{difficulty rating} depends on whether the creature notices your attempt using Awareness. If the creature's Awareness check exceeds your Sleight of Hand check, the creature notices your attempt and the \glossterm{difficulty rating} is equal to the creature's Reflex defense. Otherwise, the creature does not notice your attempt, and the \glossterm{difficulty rating} is 10. Success means you successfully steal the object. Failure means you do not steal the object.

\newpage
\skill{Social Insight}{Per}
        The Social Insight skill represents your ability to read body language and emotion.
        Most Social Insight tasks are \glossterm{hidden tasks}.

    \subsection{Discern Enchantment [Hidden]}
        When you interact with a creature, you can try to notice whether it is affected by mind-affecting abilities with a Social Insight check.
        If the creature is not affected by any such abilities, the check automatically fails.
        If the creature is affected by Compulsion or Emotion effects that are not currently altering its behavior, the check also automatically fails.
        If the creature's behavior is currently being altered by a \glossterm{Compulsion} effect, the \glossterm{difficulty rating} is 10, and success means you identify the presence of a Compulsion effect.
        If the creature's behavior is currently being altered by an \glossterm{Emotion} effect, the \glossterm{difficulty rating} is 20, and success means you identify the presence of an Emotion effect.
        Failure means you do not notice any such effects on the creature.

        You can also make this check to identify \glossterm{Subtle} effects on yourself, using the same \glossterm{difficulty ratings}.

    \subsection{Discern Lies [Hidden]}
        When you observe a creature speak, you can make a Social Insight check.
        The \glossterm{difficulty rating} is equal to the speaking creature's Deception check result.
        Success means you identify whether the creature was lying.
        Failure means you do not notice any indication that the creature is lying.

    \subsection{Discern Secret Message}
        When you observe a hidden message being conveyed, you can make a Social Insight check.
        The \glossterm{difficulty rating} is equal to the \glossterm{difficulty rating} of the secret message (see \pcref{Deception}).
        Success means you recognize that a hidden message is present, but not its contents.
        Critical success means you can understand the message.
        Failure means you don't notice the hidden message.

    \subsection{Social Assessment}\label{Social Assessment}
        You can make a \glossterm{difficulty rating} 5 Social Insight check to get a general assessment of a social situation.
        This does not take an action by itself, but you must observe the group for at least a minute.
        Success means you learn a piece of useful information about the situation, such as a general understanding of expected behaviors or a rough understanding of the social hierarchy.
        For every 5 points by which you beat the \glossterm{difficulty rating}, you gain an additional insight into the situation.

        You can make a social assessment after only a single round of observation, but you take a \minus10 penalty on the check.
        If you don't understand the language the group is using, you take a \minus10 penalty on the check.
        The information gained at a given \glossterm{difficulty rating} may vary in usefulness depending on how obvious or subtle the situation is.

\newpage
\skill{Spellsense}{Per}
        The Spellsense skill represents your ability to notice and understand spells and magical effects.

        While sleeping, you take a \minus10 penalty to the Spellsense skill.

        % TODO: add ability to identify that a creature is attuned to active effects.

    \subsection{Notice Magical Effect}
        As a \glossterm{free action}, you can notice magical effects around you.
        The \glossterm{difficulty rating} is equal to 15 \sub the \glossterm{power} of the effect.
        Extremely powerful effects are very easy to notice, but more difficult to identify.

    \subsection{Identify Magical Effect}
        When you notice a magical effect, you can make a Spellsense check to identify its nature.
        Generally, you use the same Spellsense roll to both notice and identify a magical effect.
        The \glossterm{difficulty rating} is equal to 5 \add the \glossterm{power} of the effect.
        Success means you know in general terms what the effect does.
        Critical success means you know exactly what the effect does, and if it is a common effect, what ability caused it.
        Failure means you do not recognize the effect.

        If the effect has obvious visual or other cues to its true nature, such as a wall of fire, the \glossterm{difficulty rating} is lowered by 5.
        If the effect has obvious cues that are misleading, such as a wall of fire that heals creatures that pass through it, the \glossterm{difficulty rating} is increased by 5.

        You cannot retry this check until you gain meaningful new information that would help you identify the effect.

    \subsection{Identify Spellcasting}
        You can identify spells being cast within 100 foot \glossterm{range} of you.
        The \glossterm{difficulty rating} is equal to 5 \add the spell level of the spell.
        Success means you know what spell is being cast.
        Failure means you do not.

    \subsection{Identify Potion}
        You can make a \glossterm{difficulty rating} Spellsense check to identify a potion.
        This takes a minute of careful evaluation.
        For most potions, the \glossterm{difficulty rating} is 15, and success means you identify what spell the potion contains.
        Failure means you do not learn anything about the potion's nature.

        Potions can be crafted to conceal their true nature.
        The \glossterm{difficulty rating} to identify such potions is usually 25.
        Success means you know what spell the potion contains.
        Failure means you identify the potion as whatever spell the potion is intended to resemble.
        Critical failure means you do not learn anything about the potion's nature.

    % TODO: this should give partial information on failure or only give complete information on crit
    \subsection{Identify Magical Writing}\label{Identify Magical Writing}
        You can make a Spellsense check as a standard action to identify a ritual or similar piece of magical writing.
        The \glossterm{difficulty rating} depends on the complexity of the writing.
        If the writing describes a spell or ritual, the \glossterm{difficulty rating} equal to 10 \add three times the level of the spell or ritual.
        Success means you understand the magical writing.
        Once you decipher a particular magical writing, you do not need to decipher it again.

    \subsection{Teleport Trace}
        As a standard action, you can make a Spellsense check to learn information about a teleportation within \rngmed range of you.
        The \glossterm{difficulty rating} is equal to 10 \add 1 per round since the teleportation occurred.
        Success means you identify the direction of the teleportation.
        Critical success means you also identify the distance.
        Failure means you learn no information about the teleportation.

    \subsection{Modifiers}
        All Spellsense checks share the same set of modifiers. These are noted on \trefnp{Spellsense Difficulty Modifiers}.

        This table should not generally be consulted during a game. It is provided to make it easier to estimate a task's difficulty.

\skill{Stealth}{Dex}
        The Stealth skill represents your ability to escape detection while moving or hiding. All Stealth checks are made as part of movement or other actions, so they require no special action to perform. If you have been noticed by a creature, you automatically fail all Stealth checks against that creature until you can escape its notice, such as by disappearing out of sight.

        \parhead{Size and Stealth}\label{Size and Stealth} A creature larger or smaller than Medium gains an bonus or penalty to the Stealth skill equal to \plus2 per size larger than Medium, or \minus2 for per size smaller than Medium:

            \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Blend In}
        You can make a Stealth check to blend in with a crowd. Your Stealth check is opposed by the Awareness checks of anyone looking for you. Success means you remain unobserved. Failure means the person looking for you found you.

        If you act differently from the crowd you are trying to blend in with, anyone observing you gets a \plus5 bonus to find you. You may need to make Awareness or Social Insight checks to figure out how to act, depending on the situation. If you are extremely dissimilar from the crowd, such as a naked person in church or a human among halflings, anyone observing you may gain a \plus10 or greater bonus to find you.

    \subsection{Hide [Hidden]}
        As part of movement, or as a \glossterm{move action} if you want to hide in place, you can make a Stealth check to hide so people can't see you.
        Your Stealth check is opposed by the Awareness checks of any observers.
        Success means that you can't be seen, heard, or detected in any way.
        Failure means that the observer can observe you using any senses they detected you with.

        If you do not have \glossterm{concealment} or \glossterm{concealment} from a creature (see \pcref{Cover} and \pcref{Concealment}), your Stealth check is automatically treated as a 0 against sight-based Awareness checks that creature makes, regardless of your modifiers.
        For this purpose, do not consider any cover that would be hidden as a result of a successful check, such as a shield you hold in front of you.

        If you move at up to half your speed during your turn, you take a \minus5 penalty to the Stealth skill.
        If you move at up to your full speed during your turn, you take a \minus10 penalty to the Stealth skill.
        It's practically impossible (\minus20 penalty) to remain unobserved while attacking, sprinting, or charging.

\skill{Survival}{Per}
        The Survival skill represents your ability to take care of yourself and others in the wilderness, as well as your mastery of various survival-related tasks.

    \subsection{Navigate Wilderness}
        You can make a Survival check while moving overland to avoid natural hazards and getting lost. The \glossterm{difficulty rating} depends on the terrain, as shown on \trefnp{Terrain Difficulty Ratings}. Success means that you and any group you lead can move without any trouble. Failure means you may encounter a natural hazard, depending on the terrain. Critical failure means you become lost.

        You can notice that you are lost the next time that you succeed on a check to navigate in the wilderness. Rediscovering your location requires backtracking for 1d6 hours and another Survival check against the same \glossterm{difficulty rating}\@.

        This check is made once every 8 hours you spend travelling overland. If you move at half speed, you gain a \plus5 bonus on the check.

    \subsection{Sustenance}
        You can make a Survival check to move overland at half speed while hunting and foraging. The \glossterm{difficulty rating} depends on the terrain, as shown on \trefnp{Terrain Difficulty Ratings}. Success means that you can feed yourself, and require no additional food or water. For every 2 points by which you succeed, you can provide food and water to an additional person.

        This check is made once every 8 hours you spend travelling overland. If you move at one-quarter speed, you gain a \plus5 bonus on the check.

        \begin{dtable}

                Plains       & 5                                 & 10 \\
                Swamp        & 15                                & 15 \\
            \end{dtabularx}
        \end{dtable}

    \subsection{Predict Weather}
        You can make a \glossterm{difficulty rating} 10 Survival check to predict the weather. This requires a minute of observation. Success means you know what the weather will be like up to 24 hours in advance. For every 5 points by which you succeed, you can predict the weather one additional day in advance.

    \subsection{Track}\label{Track}
        As a standard action, you can make a Survival check to follow tracks.
        The \glossterm{difficulty rating} of the check depends on how easy the tracks are to notice, as shown on \trefnp{Track Difficulty Ratings} and \trefnp{Track Difficulty Modifiers}.
        You must use this ability each round to continue following the trail, though you do not have to make an additional Survival check each round.
        You must make another Survival check if you change your movement speed, if you follow the trail for 1 mile, or if it becomes especially difficult to follow for any reason.

        If you move at up to half your normal speed as the same round that you use this ability, you take no penalty on the check.
        If you move at your full speed, you take a \minus5 penalty to the check.

        The \glossterm{difficulty rating} depends on the surface and the prevailing conditions, as given on the table below:
        The base \glossterm{difficulty rating} to follow tracks is 5 if you use scent to track, regardless of the condition of the ground.

        A creature can use the Awareness skill to notice signs of passage, but the Survival skill is necessary to follow tracks for any distance.

        \end{dtable}

        If you fail a Survival check to track, you can retry after 5 minutes of searching.

    \subsection{Use Rope}
        You can make a Survival check as a standard action to tie knots. Success means you tie the knot successfully. Failure means your action is wasted, but you can try again. Tying a typical knot is \glossterm{difficulty rating} 10. Tying a special knot, such as one that slips, slides slowly, or loosens with a tug is \glossterm{difficulty rating} 15. Knots can also be tied with the Devices skill.

        You can also make a Survival check in place of a ranged attack to set a grappling hook. You take a \minus2 penalty per 10 feet.

\newpage
\skill{Swim}{Str}
        The Swim skill represents your ability to swim.

    \subsection{Swimming}
        You can make a Swim check to move through water as a \glossterm{move action}. The \glossterm{difficulty rating} depends on the turbulence of the water, as shown on \trefnp{Swim Difficulty Ratings}. Success means you move forward by up to one-quarter your speed. Critical success means you move twice as fast. Failure means you make no progress through the water.

        \begin{dtable}
            \lcaption{Swim Difficulty Ratings}
            \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{>{\lcol}X >{\lcol}X}

                Calm water   & 5  \\
                Rough water  & 10 \\
                Stormy water & 15 \\
            \end{dtabularx}
        \end{dtable}

    \subsection{Swimming Underwater}
        You can swim underwater just like you can above water. If you are underwater, either because you failed a Swim check or because you are swimming underwater intentionally, you must hold your breath. You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to 5 \add your Constitution. After that period of time, you must make a \glossterm{difficulty rating} 10 Constitution check every round to continue holding your breath. Each round, the \glossterm{difficulty rating} for the check increases by 5. If you fail, you begin to drown.

    \subsection{Swim Speed}\label{Swim Speed}
        A creature with a swim speed can move a distance equal to its swim speed with a successful Swim check.
        In addition, it gains a \plus10 bonus to any Swim checks it makes.
