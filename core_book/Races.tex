\chapter{Races}\label{Races}

Each character has a race.

\section{Racial Traits}

\subsection{Racial Bonus Feats}
Each race grants a bonus feat at 1st level. Most races can only choose from a small group of feats, listed in the description of the race. A character must meet any prerequisites for these bonus feats, as normal.

\subsection{Race and Languages}
All characters know how to speak Common. A dwarf, elf, gnome, half-elf, half-orc, or halfling also speaks a racial language, as appropriate. For each point of Intelligence a character has at 1st level, they also know one additional language of their choice. See \pcref{Linguistics}, for details about languages.

\subsection{Small Characters}\label{Small Characters}
A Small character has the following effects based on their size.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \minus1d penalty to \glossterm{strike damage}.
    \item \minus2 penalty to Fortitude defense.
    \item \plus2 bonus to Reflex defense.
    \item \plus4 bonus to Stealth.
    \item Weight limits are three-quarters that of a Medium character (see \pcref{Encumbrance}).
  \end{itemize}

In addition, a Small character generally has a move speed five feet slower than a Medium character. A Small character must also use smaller weapons than a Medium character.
