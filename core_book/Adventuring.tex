\section{Weight Limits}\label{Weight Limits}

    \subsection{Weight Categories}\label{Weight Categories}
        Weight is generally measured in \glossterm{weight categories} rather than pounds or kilograms.
        Weight categories use the same terms as \glossterm{size categories}, as shown in \tref{Weight Categories}.
        In general, a creature's weight category is the same as its size category.

        Objects and creatures can also be either \glossterm{lightweight} or \glossterm{heavyweight}.
        Lightweight objects and creatures have a weight category that is one category lighter than their size category.
        Heavyweight objects and creatures have a weight category that is one category heavier than their size category.

        Objects that occupy only a small percentage of the space appropriate for their size category, such as swords, are usually lightweight.
        Objects that fully occupy the space appropriate for their size category, like boulders, are usually heavyweight.

        1 To calculate the weight limits for a creature with epic Strength, double the number of objects it can carry and drag for every 3 Strength beyond 30.
    \end{dtable}

    Your Strength determines how much you can carry or push, as shown in \trefnp{Weight Limits by Strength}.
    Your weight limits are measured in terms of how many objects or creatures of a given \glossterm{weight category} that you can carry or push at once.
    Instead of carrying one object of a given weight category, you can carry eight objects that are one weight category lighter.
    In general, it is not meaningful to consider the weight of any objects two weight categories lighter than your maximum weight category.

    You can carry objects or creatures up to your maximum carrying capacity without any penalty.
    This is called your \glossterm{carrying capacity}.
    Beyond that, you can push or drag objects or creatures up your pushing and dragging limit as a standard action.
    When you do, you move the weight 5 feet.

    \parhead{Multi-Legged Creatures} The figures on \trefnp{Weight Limits by Strength} are for bipedal creatures.
    A creature with four or more legs can carry, push, or drag twice as many objects as a bipedal creature of the same Strength.

    There are three movement scales in the game, as follows.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Tactical, for combat, measured in feet (or squares) per round.
        \item Local, for exploring an area, measured in feet per minute.
        \item Overland, for getting from place to place, measured in miles per
            hour or miles per day.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Tactical Movement}
        Use tactical movement for combat.

        \parhead{Minimum Movement} In some situations, your movement may be so hampered that you don't have sufficient speed even to move 5 feet (1 square). In such a case, you may use a standard action to move 5 feet (1 square) in any direction, even diagonally. (You can't take advantage of this rule to move through impassable terrain or to move when all movement is prohibited to you, such as while paralyzed.)

    \subsection{Local Movement}
        Characters exploring an area use local movement, measured in feet per minute.
        \parhead{Walk} A character can walk without a problem on the local scale.
        \parhead{Hustle} A character can hustle without a problem on the local scale. See \trefnp{Terrain and Overland Movement}, below, for movement measured in miles per hour.

    \subsection{Overland Movement}\label{Overland Movement}

            \end{dtabularx}
            1 Rafts, barges, keelboats, and rowboats are used on lakes and rivers.
            If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. In addition to 10 hours of being rowed, the vehicle can also float an additional 14 hours, if someone can guide it, so add an additional 42 miles to the daily distance traveled. These vehicles can't be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores.
        \end{dtable}

        Characters covering long distances cross-country use overland movement. Overland movement is measured in miles per hour or miles per day. A day represents 10 hours of actual travel time. For rowed watercraft, a day represents 10 hours of rowing. For a sailing ship, it represents 24 hours.

        \parhead{Walk} A character can walk 10 hours in a day of travel without a problem. Walking for longer than that, or hustling faster than that, requires an Endurance check (see \pcref{Overland Exertion}).
        \parhead{Terrain} The terrain through which a character travels affects how much distance they can cover in an hour or a day (see \trefnp{Terrain and Overland Movement}).
        A highway is a straight, major, paved road.
        A road is typically a dirt track.
        A trail is like a road, except that it allows only single-file travel and does not benefit a party traveling with vehicles.
        Trackless terrain is a wild area with no significant paths.
        \parhead{Mounted Movement} A mount bearing a rider can move at a hustle. The damage it takes when doing so, however, is not subdual damage. The creature can also be ridden in a forced march, but its Constitution checks automatically fail, and, again, the damage it takes is lethal damage.
        % TODO: does this makes sense?
        % Mounts also become fatigued when they take any damage from hustling or forced marches.

        See \trefnp{Mounts and Vehicles} for mounted speeds and speeds for vehicles pulled by draft animals.

        \parhead{Waterborne Movement} See \trefnp{Mounts and Vehicles} for speeds for water vehicles.

\section{Vision and Light}\label{Vision and Light}
    Some creatures have \glossterm{darkvision}, but most creatures need light to see by. 
    In an area of \glossterm{bright illumination}, all characters can see clearly.
    A creature can't hide in an area with bright illumination unless it is invisible or has cover.

    In an area with shadowy illumination, creatures can see dimly.
    Creatures within this area have \glossterm{concealment}, which can allow them to make Stealth checks to hide (see \pcref{Stealth}).

    In an area with \glossterm{brilliant illumination}, creatures can see clearly just like an area with bright illumination.
    In addition, no shadows exist within an an area of brilliant illumination.
    This makes many effects from the \sphere{umbramancy} mystic sphere difficult or impossible to use.

    In areas of darkness, creatures without \glossterm{darkvision} or some other form of supernatural vision are \blinded.

    Characters with low-light vision (elves, gnomes, and half-elves) treat sources of light as if they had double their normal illumination range.

    \subsection{Darkvision}\label{Darkvision}
        Characters with \glossterm{darkvision} can see lit areas normally as well as dark areas within a radius defined by the ability -- usually, 60 feet.
        A creature can't hide within that range of a character using darkvision unless it is invisible or has cover.
        Darkvision does not function if the character is in \glossterm{bright illumination}, and does not resume functioning until the end of the next round after the character leaves the area of bright illumination.

    \subsection{Attacking Unseen Foes}
        You can make attacks against creatures and objects you cannot see.
        To do so, you choose a 5-foot square and make the attack against that square.
        You have a 50\% chance to hit nothing at all with the attack and a 50\% chance to hit a random valid target in that square with your attack.

\section{Communication and Languages}\label{Languages}\label{Communication and Languages}

    \parhead{Literacy}
    All characters with an Intelligence of \minus2 or higher are presumed to be literate, allowing them to read and write any language they speak. Each language has an alphabet, though sometimes several spoken languages share a single alphabet.

    \parhead{Language Rarity}\label{Language Rarity}
    Some languages are widely spoken in the world, while others are only encountered in unusual circumstances.
    Common languages are summarized on \trefnp{Common Languages}, below.
    Rare languages are summarized on \trefnp{Rare Languages}, below.
    Rare languages are more difficult to learn, and are usually only spoken by unusual creatures.

    \parhead{Learning Languages}\label{Learning Languages}
    You can spend one \glossterm{insight point} to learn two \glossterm{common languages} or one \glossterm{rare language}.
    In addition, you can learn two common languages or one rare language by mastering the Linguistics skill (see \pcref{Linguistics}).

    \subsection{Telepathy}\label{Telepathy}
        Some creatures have the ability to telepathically communicate with other creatures.
        All telepathy abilities have a defined \glossterm{range}.
        Unless otherwise specified, a telepathic creature can only communicate with one creature at a time.

        As a \glossterm{free action}, a telepathic creature can open a telepathic communication channel with one creature it sees within the range of its telepathy ability.
        The target does not have to be willing to receive telepathic communication in this way.
        While this channel is open, the telepathic creature can cause the target to "hear" the telepathic creature's voice inside the target's head.
        If the target attempts to mentally reply while the channel is open, the telepathic creature can similarly "hear" the reply in its head as if the target was speaking.
        This does not generally grant the ability to detect any other thoughts, though exceptionally stupid targets may accidentally broadcast their private thoughts.

        Telepathic communication uses words, so it still requires a shared language to be intelligible, even though the words are only imagined.
        A telepathic creature may attempt to telepathically communicate with creatures without a language, though this is generally unproductive.
        A skilled telepath can customize the mental "voice" it projects in the same way that a creature can attempt to disguise or alter its voice when speaking.

\section{Breaking Objects}
    There are two main ways of breaking objects.
    You can deal damage to objects with attacks, similarly to how you can deal damage to creatures.
    Alternately, you can attempt to sunder the object with sheer strength.

    \subsection{Damaging Objects}
        Objects have \glossterm{hit points} and \glossterm{damage resistance} like creatures.
        However, they treat all damage they take as \glossterm{environmental damage} (see \pcref{Environmental Damage}).
        That means that all damage they take is reduced by their \glossterm{damage resistance} without subtracting from the remaining value of their damage resistance.

        An object becomes \glossterm{broken} if its \glossterm{hit points} are reduced to 0 (see \pcref{Broken and Destroyed Objects}).
        Objects cannot gain \glossterm{vital wounds}.
        Objects are also not normally subject to \glossterm{critical hits}.

    \subsection{Object Statistics}
        An object's size primarily influences the number of \glossterm{hit points} it has.
        The primary material it is constructed from determines its \glossterm{damage resistance}, and can modify the number of hit points it has.
        Details are given in \tref{Object Statistics By Size} and \tref{Object Statistics By Material}.

        \begin{dtable}
            \lcaption{Object Statistics By Size}
            \begin{dtabularx}{\textwidth}{l X X}
                \tb{Size}  & \tb{Hit Points} & \tb{Sunder Difficulty Rating} \tableheaderrule

            2. Any value here modifies the number of hit points the object would normally have based on its size.
        \end{dtable}

    \subsection{Sundering Objects}
        As a standard action, you can attempt to sunder an object you can touch.
        This requires two hands.
        An object's size and primary material determines the \glossterm{difficulty rating} of the check.
        The \glossterm{difficulty rating} of this check decreases by 2 if the object is below its maximum \glossterm{hit points}.
        Success means that the object breaks.
        Failure by 5 or less means the object loses a \glossterm{hit point}, but it does not break.
        Failure by 6 or more means nothing happens.

    \subsection{Broken and Destroyed Objects}\label{Broken and Destroyed Objects}
        An object that is reduced to 0 \glossterm{hit points} becomes \glossterm{broken}.
        You can destroy an object by causing it to lose additional hit points equal to ten times its maximum hit points, or by succeeding at a check to sunder the object by 20.

        \parhead{Broken Objects}\label{Broken Objects}
        Broken objects cannot be used for their intended purpose, but still retain enough of their original form to be repaired without too much work.
        For example, a broken wall lies in pieces on the ground and no longer blocks passage, but can be repaired with far less effort than would be required to create a wall from scratch.
        Magic items that are broken retain their magical properties once fixed.
        Broken (but not destroyed) objects can be repaired with the Craft skill for a cost equal to 10\% of their value (see \pcref{Craft}).

        \parhead{Destroyed Objects}\label{Destroyed Objects}
        Destroyed object have been damaged beyond hope of any sort of repair short of crafting the object again from raw materials.
        For example, a destroyed wall is reduced to dust or small, useless chunks of rubble.
        Magic items that are destroyed irrevocably lose their magical properties.
        The remains of a destroyed object generally occupy a space one size category smaller than the original object.

    \subsection{Relative Damage Resistance}\label{Relative Damage Resistance}
        When an object would take damage from a \glossterm{strike}, if the \glossterm{damage resistance} of the attacking object or creature is lower than the damage resistance of the defender, the attacking object or creature takes the damage instead.
        For example, if you try to break a stone wall with a wooden club, the club will break instead of the wall.
        % TODO: define hardness for creatures and their natural weapons; natural weapons should generally have higher hardness than creatures to avoid hardness reflection being common

\section{Poison}\label{Poison}
    Poisons can deal damage, weaken creatures, or even kill them.
    Some effects which are not literally poisonous, such as animal venom or fungal spores, are considered poisons.
    Unless otherwise noted, poisons are not \glossterm{conditions}, and cannot be removed by abilities that remove conditions (see \pcref{Conditions}).
    Common poisons are listed in \pcref{Poisons}.

    \subsection{Poison Transmission}\label{Poison Transmission}\label{Transmission}

        There are three ways that poisons can be contracted.

        \parhead{Contact} A contact poison affects any creature that touches it with bare skin.
        \parhead{Ingestion} An ingestion poison affects any creature that eats, drinks, or breathes it, depending on the type of poison.
        Ingestion poisons have no effect when touched or used to coat weapons.
        \parhead{Injury} An injury poison affects any creature loses \glossterm{hit points} from something bearing the poison.
        Almost all injury poisons take liquid form, and are typically used to coat weapons.

    \subsection{Poison Forms}\label{Poison Forms}

        There are four forms of poison.

        \parhead{Gas} Gaseous poisons are difficult to store, but easy to affect foes with.
        \parhead{Liquid} Liquid poisons are the most common type of poison.
        Liquid poisons can be used to coat weapons, slipped into food, or simply thrown at foes.
        A dose of a liquid poison is usually about one ounce of the poison.
        \parhead{Pellet} Some rare poisons come in small, solid pellets or cubes.
        Typically, these pellets contain a powerful liquid poison that becomes inert quickly after being exposed.
        Pellet poisons cannot be used to coat weapons or thrown at foes, but can be slipped into food.
        \parhead{Powder} Poison in powder form cannot be used to coat weapons, but can be slipped into food or thrown at foes.

    \subsection{Poison Effects}\label{Poison Effects}

        Poisons can have a wide variety of effects, as determined by the type of poison used.
        However, most poison share certain common properties.

        \parhead{Becoming Poisoned}
        All poisons have an base \glossterm{accuracy}.
        When a creature first comes into contact with a poison, the poison makes an attack roll using its accuracy against the Fortitude defense of the poisoned creature.
        On a hit, the target becomes \glossterm{poisoned} and suffers the effects of the first stage of the poison.
        On a critical hit, the target becomes \glossterm{poisoned} and suffers the effects of the two stages of the poison.
        On a miss, the target is not \glossterm{poisoned}.

        Some attacks make the target poisoned if they hit the target.
        In that case, the ability's accuracy defines the poison's accuracy.

        Many poisons have an additional effect when they hit the target for the third time.

        \parhead{Poison Attacks}
        At the end of each subsequent round after the target becomes poisoned, the poison makes an attack roll against the Fortitude defense of the poisoned creature.
        Each hit increases the \glossterm{poison stage} of the poison.
        For every 10 points by which the attack hits, the poison progresses by an additional stage.
        On a miss, the creature gets closer to resisting the poison (see Resisting Poisons, below).

        \parhead{Resisting Poisons}
        If a poison misses a creature three times with its attack at the end of each round, the creature stops being poisoned by that poison.
        % Some poisons may require more attacks to end the poison, as indicated in their description.

        \parhead{Multiple Doses}
        A creature can be affected by multiple doses of the same poison.
        This does not cause the same effect to occur multiple times.
        However, each extra dose increases the accuracy of the poison by 1, up to a maximum bonus of \plus10 more than the poison's normal accuracy.

        A poison is considered the same if it has the same name and comes from the same source.
        For example, a creature bitten multiple times by the same giant spider suffers multiple doses of the same poison.
        A creature bitten multiple times by different giant spiders considers each spider's poison separately.

        \parhead{Poison Quality} Some poisons are unusually high or low quality.

    \subsection{Creating Poisons}\label{Creating Poisons}

        You can use the Craft (poison) skill to create poisons.
        To create a poison, you must make a Craft (poison) check against a \glossterm{difficulty rating} equal to 10 \add the poison's base accuracy.
        For every 2 points by which you beat this \glossterm{difficulty rating}, the created poison's accuracy gains a \plus1 bonus, up to a maximum bonus of \plus10 more than the poison's base accuracy.

        Creating a poison requires special materials.
        The type of materials required, and how those materials can be acquired, depend on the type of poison.

        \begin{itemize}
            \itemhead{Plant}: Plant-based poisons can typically be harvested by making a Survival check to search in appropriate terrain.
                The \glossterm{difficulty rating} of this check is usually equal to 10 \add the base accuracy of the poison.
            \itemhead{Venom}: Venom requires an appropriate body part from a creature -- often, poison it naturally produces.
            \itemhead{Alchemical}: Alchemical poisons require alchemical materials.
                These cannot normally be found in nature.
                In unusual circumstances, these components can be synthesized from natural chemicals or magical materials with a Craft (alchemy) check equal to 10 \add the base accuracy of the poison.
        \end{itemize}

\section{Wealth And Money}

    \subsection{Coins}
        The most common coin is the gold piece (gp). A gold piece is worth 10 silver pieces. Each silver piece is worth 10 copper pieces (cp). In addition to copper, silver, and gold coins, there are also platinum pieces (pp), which are each worth 10 gp.

        The standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce (fifty to the pound).

        \begin{dtable}
            \lcaption{Coin Exchange Values}
            \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{l c *{4}{>{\ccol}X}}
                & & \tb{CP} & \tb{SP} & \tb{GP} & \tb{PP} \tableheaderrule

                Gold piece (gp) & = & 100 & 10 & 1 & 1/10 \\
                Platinum piece (pp) & = & 1,000 & 100 & 10 & 1
            \end{dtabularx}
        \end{dtable}

    \subsection{Wealth Other Than Coins}
        Merchants commonly exchange trade goods without using currency. As a means of comparison, some trade goods are detailed below.

        \begin{dtable}
            \lcaption{Trade Goods}

                1 sp & One pound of iron, or one chicken \\
                5 sp & One pound of tobacco or copper \\
                1 gp & One pound of cinnamon, or one goat \\
                2 gp & One pound of ginger or pepper, or one sheep \\
                3 gp & One pig \\
                4 gp & One square yard of linen \\
                5 gp & One pound of salt or silver \\
                10 gp & One square yard of silk, or one cow \\
                15 gp & One pound of saffron or cloves, or one ox \\
                50 gp & One pound of gold \\
                500 gp & One pound of platinum
            \end{dtabularx}
        \end{dtable}

    \subsection{Selling Items}
        In general, a character can sell something for a quarter its listed price.

        Trade goods, such as gems, are the exception to this rule and can be sold for their full value.
        A trade good, in this sense, is a valuable good that can be easily exchanged almost as if it were cash itself.
