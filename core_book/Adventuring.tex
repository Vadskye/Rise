        1 To calculate the carrying capacity for a creature with epic Strength, double its carrying capacity every 3 Strength.
    \end{dtable}

    A creature's Strength determines how much weight it can carry, as shown in \trefnp{Carrying Capacity by Strength}.
    A creature can carry weight up to its light carrying capacity without any penalty.
    If it carries more than that, but less than its maximum carrying capacity, it increases its \glossterm{encumbrance} by 4.
    This stacks with the encumbrance from any armor the creature wears.

    \parhead{Lifting and Dragging} You can lift as much as your maximum carrying capacity over your head.

    You can lift as much as 1-1/2 your maximum carrying capacity off the ground (the sum of your light and maximum weight limits).
    While overloaded in this way, you increase your \glossterm{encumbrance} by 10, you take a \minus10 penalty to \glossterm{accuracy} with physical attacks, and you can only move by spending a \glossterm{standard action} to move 5 feet.
    This replaces the encumbrance from carrying more than your light carrying capacity.

    You can generally push or drag along the ground as much as five times your maximum carrying capacity.

    \parhead{Multi-Legged Creatures} The figures on \trefnp{Carrying Capacity by Strength} are for bipedal creatures. A creature with four or more legs can carry 50\% more weight than a bipedal creature of the same Strength.

    \parhead{Tremendous Strength} For Strength scores not shown on \trefnp{Carrying Capacity by Strength}, subtract 3 from its Strength until you find a Strength value shown on the chart. For each time you subtracted in this way, double the weight limits listed on the chart.

    \end{dtable}

    There are three movement scales in the game, as follows.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Tactical, for combat, measured in feet (or squares) per round.
        \item Local, for exploring an area, measured in feet per minute.
        \item Overland, for getting from place to place, measured in miles per
            hour or miles per day.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Tactical Movement}
        Use tactical movement for combat.

        \parhead{Minimum Movement} In some situations, your movement may be so hampered that you don't have sufficient speed even to move 5 feet (1 square). In such a case, you may use a standard action to move 5 feet (1 square) in any direction, even diagonally. (You can't take advantage of this rule to move through impassable terrain or to move when all movement is prohibited to you, such as while paralyzed.)

    \subsection{Local Movement}
        Characters exploring an area use local movement, measured in feet per minute.
        \parhead{Walk} A character can walk without a problem on the local scale.
        \parhead{Hustle} A character can hustle without a problem on the local scale. See \trefnp{Terrain and Overland Movement}, below, for movement measured in miles per hour.

    \subsection{Overland Movement}

            1 Quadrupeds, such as horses, can carry heavier loads than characters can. See \tref{Carrying Capacity by Strength}, for more information. \\
            2 Rafts, barges, keelboats, and rowboats are used on lakes and rivers.
            If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. In addition to 10 hours of being rowed, the vehicle can also float an additional 14 hours, if someone can guide it, so add an additional 42 miles to the daily distance traveled. These vehicles can't be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores.
        \end{dtable}

        Characters covering long distances cross-country use overland movement. Overland movement is measured in miles per hour or miles per day. A day represents 10 hours of actual travel time. For rowed watercraft, a day represents 10 hours of rowing. For a sailing ship, it represents 24 hours.
        \parhead{Walk} A character can walk 10 hours in a day of travel without a problem. Walking for longer than that can wear him or her out (see Forced March, below).
        \parhead{Hustle} A character can hustle for 1 hour without a problem. Hustling for a second hour in between sleep cycles deals 1 point of \glossterm{subdual damage}, and each additional hour deals twice the damage taken during the previous hour of hustling. A character who takes any subdual damage from hustling becomes fatigued.
        \parhead{Terrain} The terrain through which a character travels affects how much distance they can cover in an hour or a day (see \trefnp{Terrain and Overland Movement}).
        A highway is a straight, major, paved road.
        A road is typically a dirt track.
        A trail is like a road, except that it allows only single-file travel and does not benefit a party traveling with vehicles.
        Trackless terrain is a wild area with no significant paths.
        \parhead{Forced March}\label{Forced March} In a day of normal walking, a character walks for 10 hours. The rest of the daylight time is spent making and breaking camp, resting, and eating.

        A character can walk for more than 10 hours in a day by making a forced march. For each hour of marching beyond 10 hours, a Constitution check (DR 10, \plus2 per extra hour) is required. If the check fails, the character takes 1d6 points of subdual damage. A character who takes any subdual damage from a forced march becomes fatigued. Eliminating the subdual damage also eliminates the fatigue. It's possible for a character to march into unconsciousness by pushing himself too hard.

        \parhead{Mounted Movement} A mount bearing a rider can move at a hustle. The damage it takes when doing so, however, is lethal damage, not subdual damage. The creature can also be ridden in a forced march, but its Constitution checks automatically fail, and, again, the damage it takes is lethal damage. Mounts also become fatigued when they take any damage from hustling or forced marches.

        See \trefnp{Mounts and Vehicles} for mounted speeds and speeds for vehicles pulled by draft animals.

        \parhead{Waterborne Movement} See \trefnp{Mounts and Vehicles} for speeds for water vehicles.

\section{Exploration}
    \subsection{Vision and Light}
        Some creatures have \glossterm{darkvision}, but most creatures need light to see by. 
        In an area of bright light, all characters can see clearly. A creature can't hide in an area of bright light unless it is invisible or has cover.

        In an area with shadowy illumination, creatures can see dimly.
        Creatures within this area have \concealment, which can allow them to make Stealth checks to hide (see \pcref{Stealth}).

        In areas of darkness, creatures without \glossterm{darkvision} or some other form of supernatural vision are \blinded.

        Characters with low-light vision (elves, gnomes, and half-elves) treat sources of light as if they had double their normal illumination range.

        Characters with \glossterm{darkvision} can see lit areas normally as well as dark areas within a radius defined by the ability -- usually, 50 feet. A creature can't hide within that range of a character using darkvision unless it is invisible or has cover. Darkvision does not function if the character is in bright light, and does not resume functioning until the end of the next round after the character leaves the area of bright light.

    \subsection{Breaking And Entering}
        When attempting to break an object, you have two choices: smash it with a weapon or break it with sheer strength.

        \subsubsection{Smashing an Object}
            Smashing an object is accomplished by simply attacking the object as you would any other target. If it is attended, this is done using the \textit{disarm} special attack (see \pcref{Disarm}.

            \parhead{Armor Defense} Objects are easier to hit than creatures because they usually don't move, but many are tough enough to shrug off some damage from each blow.
% Why is this true? makes things simpler...
            Normally, an object's Armor defense is equal to 0.

            \parhead{Hardness} Each object has a \glossterm{hardness} which indicates how durable it is.
            For details, see \pcref{Hardness}.

%None of these tables exist currently. Also object hit points are obnoxious.
%(see \trefnp{Common Armor, Weapon, and Shield Hardness and Hit Points}; \trefnp{Substance Hardness and Hit Points}; and \trefnp{Object Hardness and Hit Points}).
            \parhead{Hit Points} An object's hit point total depends on what it is made of and how big it is. When an object's hit points reach 0, it's ruined.

            Very large objects may have separate hit point totals for different sections.

            \subparhead{Energy Attacks} Sonic attacks deal damage to most objects just as they do to creatures; roll damage and apply it normally after a successful hit. Electricity and fire attacks deal half damage to most objects, and cold attacks deal one-quarter damage to most objects.

            \subparhead{Piercing Weapon Damage} Objects take half damage from piercing weapons.

            \subparhead{Ineffective Weapons} Certain weapons just can't effectively deal damage to certain objects.

            \subparhead{Immunities} Objects are immune to \glossterm{subdual damage} and to critical hits. Even animated objects, which are otherwise considered creatures, have these immunities because they are constructs.

            \subparhead{Vulnerability to Certain Attacks} Certain attacks are especially successful against some objects. In such cases, attacks deal double their normal damage and may ignore the object's hardness.

            \parhead{Saving Throws} Nonmagical, unattended items never make saving throws. They are considered to have failed their saving throws, so they always are affected by spells. An item attended by a character (being grasped, touched, or worn) makes saving throws as the character (that is, using the character's saving throw bonus).

            \par Magic items have defenses. A magic item's Fortitude and Mental defenses are equal to 5 \add its \glossterm{power}, though its Reflex defense is 0. An attended magic item uses its defenses or its owner's defenses, whichever are higher.

            \subparhead{Animated Objects} Animated objects count as creatures for purposes of determining their Armor Defense (do not treat them as inanimate objects).


        \subsubsection{Damaged Objects}
            An object that has taken damage remains fully functional until its hit points are reduced to 0, at which point it is \glossterm{broken}.
            Any additional damage is applied as \glossterm{vital damage}.
            If an object has more vital damage than its maximum hit points, it is \glossterm{destroyed}.

            Both magical and mundane objects that are damaged or broken can be repaired to full hit points for a cost equal to 10\% of their value.
            You must be able to craft the item originally to repair it.

            \parhead{Broken Objects}\label{Broken Objects}
            Broken objects cannot be used for their intended purpose, but still retain enough of their original form to be repaired without too much work. For example, a broken wall lies in pieces on the ground and no longer blocks passage, but can be repaired with no more effort than damaged items. Magic items that are broken retain their magical properties once fixed. Damaged and broken (but not destroyed) objects can be repaired with the Craft skill.

            \parhead{Destroyed Objects}\label{Destroyed Objects}
            Destroyed object have been damaged beyond hope of any sort of repair short of crafting the object again from raw materials.
            For example, a destroyed wall is reduced to dust or small, useless chunks of rubble.
            Magic items that are destroyed irrevocably lose their magical properties.

        \subsubsection{Breaking Items}
            If you try to break something with sudden force rather than by dealing damage, use a Strength check (rather than an attack roll and damage roll, as with the disarm special attack) to see whether you succeed.
            The DR depends more on the construction of the item than on the material.

            If an item has no more than half its hit points remaining, the DR to break it drops by 5.

            A crowbar or portable ram improves a character's chance of breaking open a door.

\section{Wealth And Money}

    \subsection{Coins}
        The most common coin is the gold piece (gp). A gold piece is worth 10 silver pieces. Each silver piece is worth 10 copper pieces (cp). In addition to copper, silver, and gold coins, there are also platinum pieces (pp), which are each worth 10 gp.

        The standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce (fifty to the pound).

        \begin{dtable}

    \subsection{Selling Items}
        In general, a character can sell something for a quarter its listed price.

        Trade goods, such as gems, are the exception to this rule and can be sold for their full value.
        A trade good, in this sense, is a valuable good that can be easily exchanged almost as if it were cash itself.
