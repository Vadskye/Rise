\chapter{Spells}\label{Spells}

An \M{} or \F{} appearing at the end of a spell's name in the spell lists denotes a spell with a material or focus component, respectively, that is not normally included in a spell component pouch.

\parhead{Order of Presentation} In the spell lists and the spell descriptions that follow them, the spells are presented in alphabetical order by name except for those belonging to certain spell chains.

\parhead{Targets, Subjects, Creatures, and Characters} All of these words refer to whatever is affected by the spell. ``Targets'' and ``Subjects'' are used for spells that target individual creatures or objects. Spells with instantaneous duration typically refer to ``targets'', while spells that have a duration typically refer to ``subjects''. ``Creatures'' and ``characters'' are used interchangeably, and are typically used with spells that do not affect specific targets.
