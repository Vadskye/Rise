\chapter{Characters}

There are five major customization systems in Rise that all characters share.
In rough order of how much they affect your character's play style, they are your class archetypes, attributes, skills, insight points, and species.
At the GM's discretion, you may also have one or more feats, which can have a strong impact on your character's identity (see \pcref{Feats}).

This chapter explains those five fundamental elements.
If you plan on playing a premade character, the information in this chapter will still be useful so you can understand how your character works, but you can skip the Character Creation section at the end.
Some of the information in this chapter won't fully make sense until you've read future chapters.
You can either skim past terms you don't yet understand or look them up as you go along.

\section{Classes Overview}
    Each character has one of ten classes.
    Your class determines what your character's fundamental source of power is, and has a large impact on the play style of your character.
    Of course, any two members of the same class can be very different in both narrative style and mechanics based on the other choices they have made.
    Classes are intended as an aid to help give your character a cohesive identity, not a limitation on the possible character concepts you can fulfill.

    The ten classes are briefly summarized below.
    Each class has five archetypes, and any individual character chooses three of the five archetypes from their class.
    For full details about how each class works, see \pcref{Classes}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Barbarians are mighty warriors who draw power from their physical prowess.
        \item Clerics are divine spellcasters who draw power from their veneration of a deity.
        \item Druids are nature spellcasters who draw power from their veneration of the natural world.
        \item Fighters are highly disciplined warriors who excel in physical combat of any kind.
        \item Monks are agile masters of ``ki'' who hone their personal abilities to strike down foes and perform supernatural feats.
        \item Paladins are divinely empowered warriors embody a particular alignment.
        \item Rangers are skilled hunters who bridge the divide between nature and civilization.
        \item Rogues are exceptionally skillful characters known for their ability to strike at their foe's weak points in combat.
        \item Sorcerers are arcane spellcasters who draw power from their inherently magical nature.
        \item Warlocks are pact spellcasters who draw their power from a dark pact made with infernal creatures.
        \item Wizards are arcane spellcasters who study magic to unlock its powerful secrets.
    \end{itemize}

\section{Attributes}\label{Attributes}

    Each character has six \glossterm{attributes}: Strength (Str), Dexterity (Dex), Constitution (Con), Intelligence (Int), Perception (Per), and Willpower (Wil).
    Each attribute represents a character's raw talent in that area.
    A 0 in an attribute represents average human capacity.
    That doesn't mean that every commoner has a 0 in every attribute; not everyone is average, after all.

    \subsection{Strength (Str)}\label{Strength}
        {
            Strength measures your muscle and physical power.
            Characters with a high Strength tend to have strong offensive capabilities with nonmagical abilities, and prefer wearing heavier armor.
            It has the following effects:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Strength determines how much you can carry (see \tref{Weight Limits by Strength}).
                    You generally need a Strength of at least 1 to wear heavy body armor.
                \item You gain a bonus (or penalty) to your \glossterm{power} with \glossterm{mundane} abilities, such as normal weapon attacks, equal to your Strength (see \pcref{Power}).
                \item You reduce your total \glossterm{encumbrance} from \glossterm{armor} by an amount equal to your base Strength (see \pcref{Encumbrance}).

        {
            Dexterity measures your hand-eye coordination, agility, and reflexes.

            \end{itemize}
        }

    \subsection{Constitution (Con)}\label{Constitution}
        {
            Constitution represents your health and stamina.
            Characters with a high Constitution tend to have strong defensive capabilities.
            It has the following effects:
            \begin{itemize}

        }

    \subsection{Willpower (Wil)}\label{Willpower}
        {
            Willpower represents your ability to endure mental hardships.

            It has the following effects:
            \begin{itemize}

            \end{itemize}
        }

    \subsection{Base Attributes}\label{Base Attributes}
        Most statistics depend on your \glossterm{base attributes}, rather than your total attributes.
        Your attributes automatically increase with level as defined in \tref{Increasing Attributes With Level}, but your base attributes do not automatically increase with level.

        A small number of abilities can increase your \glossterm{base attributes} after 1st level.
        If you change a base attribute, the total value for that attribute changes appropriately.

        \begin{dtable}
            \lcaption{Increasing Attributes With Level}
            \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{l X}
                \tb{Base Attribute} & \tb{Total Attribute}        \\
                0 or lower          & 0                           \\
                1                   & 1                           \\
                2                   & 1 \add one quarter level    \\
                3                   & 3 \add half level           \\
                4                   & 4 \add three-quarters level \\
                5                   & 4 \add level                \\
            \end{dtabularx} 
        \end{dtable}

    \subsection{Extraordinary Attributes}
        Some abilities can increase your base attributes above 5.
        For each point of base attribute beyond 5, you increase your total attribute by one quarter of your level.

        For example, a 20th level character might have a total base Strength of 6.
        Their total Strength would be equal to 4 \add one and a half times their level, for a total of 34.

\section{Skills Overview}
    Skills represent the myriad of talents that people can have, such as cooking or swimming.
    Each character is trained in a certain number of skills.
    If you are trained in a skill, you have a higher likelihood of succeeding when you try to use it.
    The number of skills you are trained in is mostly determined by your class and Intelligence.

    The twenty-six skills are summarized below.

    You can spend \glossterm{insight points} to gain new special abilities or to learn new proficiencies.
    Your \glossterm{class} gives you a certain number of insight points, and you gain a bonus (or penalty) to that number of insight points equal to your base Intelligence.
    Some abilities can also grant insight points.

    Any character can spend insight points in any of the following ways.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item You can spend two \glossterm{insight points} to become a \glossterm{multiclass} character (see \pcref{Multiclass Characters}).

    \end{itemize}
    In addition, every class has at least one way to spend \glossterm{insight points} to learn additional abilities.

\section{Species}\label{Species}
    Each character has a species.
    There are seven common species described below.
    At the GM's discretion, you may be able to play a character with a more unusual species (see \pcref{Uncommon Species}).

\section{Alignment}\label{Alignment}
    A creature's general moral and personal attitudes are represented by its alignment: lawful good, neutral good, chaotic good, lawful neutral, neutral, chaotic neutral, lawful evil, neutral evil, or chaotic evil.

    Alignment is a tool for developing your identity.
    It is not a straitjacket for restricting your actions.
    Each alignment represents a broad range of personality types or personal philosophies, so two characters of the same alignment can still be quite different from each other.
    In addition, few people are completely consistent.

    \subsection{Good vs. Evil}
        The ancient battle between good and evil takes many forms, and distinguishing good from evil is a deeply complex task.
        For the purposes of Rise, good and evil are strictly defined according to selfishness vs\. altruism.
        The actions of good characters may at times be morally reprehensible, and the actions of evil characters may seem to be virtuous.
        However, this narrow definition of good and evil avoids the complexities of defining a more robust moral system while preserving the fundamental conflict between good and evil.

        \parhead{Good} Good characters are altruistic.
        They take other creatures into account when making decisions, and actively try to help or improve others around them.
        Good characters may have significant disagreements about what actions are best, but they consistently prioritize the good of others or the ``greater good'' over their own desires.
        Different good characters may also have different perspectives on who they should take into account when making decisions.
        For example, some good characters actively work to protect animals and plants, while others only care about sentient beings.

        Sometimes, altruistic characters can commit reprehensible actions out of necessity or because they believe that a greater good is being served.
        As long as their motivation is selfless, those characters are still considered to be ``good'' from the perspective of Rise's alignment system, which does not attempt to model all of the complexities of real-world morality.

        \parhead{Evil} Evil characters are selfish.
        They consistently prioritize their own desires and needs over the desires of others, even their allies or friends.
        Evil characters may perform good deeds, but their ultimate motivation is to help themselves or make themselves feel better, not to help others.

        \parhead{Neutral} Characters that are neutral between good and evil are neither consistently altruistic nor consistently selfish.
        Most neutral characters behave altruistically in some ways and selfishly in other ways -- either at different times, or about different aspects of life.
        They often have strong bonds to particular individuals who they care about selflessly, but are not altruistic in a general sense.
        Non-sentient beings such as animals are neutral rather than good or evil.

    \subsection{Law vs. Chaos}
        \parhead{Law} Lawful characters value consistency.
        They obey rules that guide their actions.
        Some lawful characters draw their rules from external forces, such as serving a particular master or following the legal laws of the land.
        Other lawful characters follow rules they make for themselves.

        \parhead{Chaos} Chaotic characters value flexibility and freedom.
        They make decisions based on what they think or feel at the time, even if it is inconsistent with their previous statements or actions.

        \parhead{Neutral} Characters that are neutral between law and chaos are neither exceptionally consistent nor exceptionally inconsistent.
        They tend to be generally consistent but may change their minds under the right circumstances.
        Non-sentient beings such as animals are neutral rather than lawful or chaotic.

    \subsection{Age}
        The typical age for each species is listed in \trefnp{Typical Ages}.
        If you are old, you take a \minus2 penalty to \glossterm{checks} based on Strenth, Dexterity, Constitution, and Perception.
        However, you gain a \plus2 bonus to \glossterm{checks} based on Intelligence and Willpower.
        If you are venerable, these modifiers change to \minus4 and \plus4 respectively.
        In general, player characters should not start as old or venerable age, but the GM can always allow it for specific campaigns if they want.

        When you reach venerable age, the GM secretly rolls your maximum age, which is the number from the Venerable column on \trefnp{Aging Effects} plus the result of the dice roll indicated on the Maximum Age column on that table.
        They record the result.
        If you reach your maximum age, you die of old age at some time during the following year.

        The maximum ages are for player characters. Most people in the world at large die from pestilence, accidents, infections, or violence before getting to venerable age.

    \subsection{Height and Weight}
        The typical height and weight for each species is listed in \tref{Typical Height and Weight}.
        The average man from each species is slightly taller and heavier than the average woman, but this is not a restriction for player characters.

\section{Character Creation}\label{Character Creation}

    Creating a charcter involves a mixture of thematic and mechanical decisions that will work together to create a fun character that is rewarding to play.
    As mentioned earlier in this chapter, there are four core systems for customizing your character's mechanics: class, attributes, skills, and species.
    In addition, there are five core thematic considerations when creating a character: concept, personality, motivation, background, and appearance.

    These decisions are described below in a order that makes sense for many characters, and full details for each decision are given after this initial list.
    It is essentially a sandwich, with narrative decisions wrapped around a central core of your character's mechanical components.
    However, you can make several of these decisions in any order, and you may find it easier to create a character in a different way.
    The only real limitation is that your skills must be the last mechanical choice you make, since they are strongly affected by all of your other choices.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Character concept: Describe your character with a short, simple phrase that captures their essence.
        \item Motivation and goal: Describe what your character wants.
        \item Alignment: Describe your character's moral compass.

        \item Species: Define your character's species.
        \item Attributes: Define your character's fundamental physical and mental potential.
        \item Class archetypes: Define your character's source of power.
        \item Insight points: Learn new abilities and gain additional proficiencies.
        \item Skills: Define your character's areas of non-combat expertise.

        \item Personality: Describe how your character acts and reacts to the world.
        \item Background: Describe what made your character become who they are now.
        \item Appearance: Describe what your character looks like.
        \item Name: Choose a name.
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsection{Step 1: Character Concept}

        Fundamentally, who is your character?
        You should think of a short phrase that describes the core concept behind the character you will create.
        It's best to think in broad strokes when creating a character concept.
        Your concept should be more than just a factual description of your species or what you do.
        It should be something that makes you memorable.
        Some sample character concepts are given below for inspiration.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Pragmatic wanderer
            \item Artistic pixie
            \item Mushroom-obsessed hermit
            \item Bumbling do-gooder
            \item Dim-witted bodyguard
            \item Cowardly storyteller
            \item Bear-barian
            \item Parsimonious law enforcer
            \item Peaceful naturalist
            \item Trigger-happy pyromaniac
            \item Heroic, simple-minded warrior
            \item Friendly necromancer
            \item Chaotic speed demon
            \item Pompous ex-noble
            \item Sarcastic mercenary
            \item Battle-scarred priest
            \item Ambitious arcane prodigy
            \item Charismatic musician
            \item Aloof scholar
            \item Blunt-spoken warrior
            \item Crazed prophet
            \item Polite warrior
            \item World-weary pirate
            \item Devout cultist
            \item Con artist with a heart of gold
        \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Step 2: Motivation and Goal}
        Why does your character put in all of the effort that adventuring requires?
        They probably have a goal that they are trying to achieve, or an ideal that they are trying to embody.
        Writing down a specific goal or ideal can be helpful as an anchor point when defining the character.

    \subsection{Step 3: Alignment}
        Your character's alignment reflects their moral character: are they more inclined to good or evil, and to chaos or order?
        Alignments are described in more detail at \pcref{Alignment}.

    \subsection{Step 4: Species}
        It's often convenient to make your species your first mechanically relevant choice.
        Your species can have a strong effect on your personality and narrative, but it has a relatively small effect on your character's play style.
        It's also easier to know your species before you choose your attributes, since your species can slightly modify your attributes.

        Choose one of the seven common species options, or talk with your GM about choosing an uncommon species (see \pcref{Uncommon Species}).
        Record any specific abilities the species gives you on your character sheet, but if this is your first mechanical choice, you won't be able to finalize any of your statistics yet.
        You should also choose the languages that you can speak, since that is influenced by your species (see \pcref{Communication and Languages}).

    \subsection{Step 5: Attributes}
        Your attributes are a good option for your second mechanically relevant choice.
        They have a large impact on your character's strengths and weaknesses, so it's useful to know them as soon as possible.
        They're also much easier to understand and finalize than your class archetypes.

        There are two common ways for you to determine your attribute scores: using a predefined set of scores, or using a point buy system.
        Once you have chosen your attributes and applied your species modifer to attributes (if any), you should record in your character sheets the various effects that your attributes have on your statistics.

        \subsubsection{Predefined Attribute Scores}
            This is the simplest method.
            Simply take the following set of attribute scores and distribute them as you choose among your attributes:

            3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0

            This set of attribute scores is called the ``elite array''.
            For more extreme characters, you may use the ``savant array'':

            4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0.

            Finally, for more well-rounded characters, you may use the ``balanced array'':

            2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1

        \subsubsection{Point Buy}
            With this method, you can fully control your attribute scores to precisely match what you want to be able to do.
            All your attribute scores start at 0.
            You get 10 points to distribute among your attributes.
            Attributes can be bought according to the costs on \trefnp{Attribute Score Point Costs}.
            The listed cost is the total cost required to gain the listed base attribute.
            You are 1st level when you start, which adds appropriately to your total attribute score.

            \begin{dtable}
                \lcaption{Attribute Score Point Costs}
                \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{X X l}
                    \tb{Cumulative Point Cost} & \tb{Base Attribute} & \tb{Total Attribute}        \tableheaderrule
                    0                          & 0                         & 0                           \\
                    1                          & 1                         & 1                           \\
                    2                          & 2                         & 2 \add one quarter level    \\
                    4                          & 3                         & 3 \add half level           \\
                    6                          & 4                         & 4 \add three-quarters level \\
                    \tdash                     & 5                         & 5 \add level                \\
                \end{dtabularx}
            \end{dtable}

        \subsubsection{Attribute Penalties}\label{Attribute Penalties}
            You can voluntarily take penalties to your attributes.
            If you reduce an attribute to a total of \minus1, you become \glossterm{trained} in an additional skill (see \pcref{Trained Skills}).
            If you reduce an attribute to a total of \minus2, you instead gain an additional \glossterm{insight point} (see \pcref{Insight Points}).
            You cannot gain these benefits from reducing more than two attributes below 0 in this way.

    \subsection{Step 6: Class and Class Archetypes}
        This is the most complicated choice you have to make for your character.
        It requires the most reading in the Classes chapter to understand what your options are and which classes and class archetypes are interesting to you.
        Class details can be found in \pcref{Classes}.

        You should choose one of the ten classes, and then any three of the five archetypes within that class.
        Once you have chosen your three archetypes, you'll need to choose which one of those three archetypes will be rank 1, giving you access to an extra ability from that archetype.
        The other two archetypes will be rank 0 until you gain a level.
        You should also choose the \glossterm{weapon groups} that you have access to, since that is influenced by your class (see \pcref{Weapon Groups}).

        If you are particularly adventurous, this is also when you should choose if you want to be a multiclass character.
        Multiclass characters can gain access to archetypes from multiple classes.
        This does not increase the number of archetypes you know, so it does not directly increase your power.
        However, multiclass characters can be more specialized or more versatile than single-class characters, and can represent unusual character concepts.

    \subsection{Step 7: Insight Points}
        Once you have chosen your class archetypes, attributes, and species, you know how many insight points you have, and can choose how to spend them.
        Don't forget to record on your character sheet how you spent each insight point.
        Otherwise, you might get confused later about why you have more spells known or skills trained than you normally would.

        In rare circumstances, you might want to delay spending your insight points until you are higher level.
        For example, a fighter/sorcerer multiclass character who wants to have both spells and maneuvers can't have access to both spells and maneuvers at level 1, so they wouldn't be able to spend insight points on both spells and maneuvers.
        You aren't forced to spend all of your insight points, so you can save them up for later.
        You can also talk to your GM about spending them on something minor at level 1 and then retraining those insight points once you are higher level.

    \subsection{Step 8: Skills}
        You should choose which skills you have \glossterm{trained} (see \pcref{Skills}).
        Your \glossterm{class} gives you a certain number of trained skills from among the \glossterm{class skills} for that class.
        The class skills for each class are summarized in \tref{Class Skills}.

        There are other ways to become trained in skills that are not part of your class.
        If your base Intelligence is positive, you gain additional trained skills equal to your base Intelligence.
        You can also spend \glossterm{insight points} to gain one trained skill per insight point (see \pcref{Insight Points}).
        Some abilities can grant additional trained skills.

        If you are untrained in a skill, your bonus with that skill is equal to half of its associated attribute (if any).
        If you are trained in a skill, your bonus with that skill is equal to 3 \add the higher of its associated attribute (if any) and half your level.
        Many abilities can increase or decrease your bonus with particular skills.

        The number of skills you can have trained, and which skills those are, depend on every preceding step, so it's a good place to finish.

        Sometimes, you might have more trained skills than you know what to do with, especially if you are still figuring out the details of your character concept.
        You aren't forced to decide all of your trained skills at level 1, so you can save them up and choose more trained skills when you level up.
        You can also talk to your GM about letting you decide your trained skills on the fly during the first game session or two based on what actions you take during the session.
        This can be a fun way to figure out what your character's personality is through the process of playing them.

    \subsection{Step 9: Starting Equipment}
        When you create a character, they can start with some basic items.
        Items have \glossterm{item levels} that indicate the approximate level that characters can reasonably get access to them.
        Typically, you can start with a single level 1 or lower item, up to three level 1/2 items, and a standard adventuring kit.
        Individual campaigns or character backstories may significantly change what starting equipment is available, so check with your GM.

    \subsection{Step 10: Personality}

        How does your character behave?
        You should decide, in broad terms, what your character's personality is.
        This will change over time, especially as you start playing the character in the game, so you don't need to define everything perfectly.
        However, having a general sense of how your character behaves is helpful.

        For most games, it's important to have a personality that can tolerate working with others in a group.
        A character that is excessively aloof, moody, or obnoxious can make the game more difficult to enjoy for everyone.
        Likewise, a character who tries to speak for everyone or who repeatedly steals the spotlight from others can be frustrating to work with.
        You should figure out the right balance with your fellow players and your GM.\@

    \subsection{Step 11: Background}
        What happened in their character's past to make them the way that they are?
        What were their parents like, and where are they now?
        You don't have to have all of the answers when you first create a character, but it's good to have some idea.
        The richer your backstory, the more the GM can weave that into the narrative of the current story.
        Sometimes, it's fun to take a break from saving the world to go visit someone's grandma.

    \subsection{Step 12: Appearance}
        What does your character look like?
        What would someone's first impression of them be?
        This can be helpful for understanding how other characters in the game world - or even monsters - would react to you.

    \subsection{Step 13: Name}
        What is your character's name?
        This seemingly minor choice can reveal a lot about the tone your character will set in the universe.
        If your name is Sir Patty Cakes or Shanky, the game is likely to be lighter and sillier in tone.
        Fancy fantasy-appropriate names ike Ayala or Theodolus tend to push the game in a slightly more serious direction, especially if you make the daring choice to include a canonical last name.
        As always, stay in tune with what the GM and the other players are expecting.

\section{Character Advancement}\label{Character Advancement}

    As you accomplish challenges and defeats foes, you gain experience.
    If you have enough experience, you gain a level.
    You gain some abilities at specific levels, as described in \trefnp{Character Advancement}.

    When you gain a level, the following things happen:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Your \glossterm{hit points} and \glossterm{damage resistance} increase (see \tref{Character Advancement}).
        \item You gain an additional \glossterm{archetype rank} (see \pcref{Archetypes})
        \item Your \glossterm{attributes} may increase (see \tref{Increasing Attributes With Level})
        \item Your bonus with \glossterm{trained} skills may increase (see \pcref{Trained Skills})
        \item If the level is even, your \glossterm{accuracy} increases by 1 (see \pcref{Accuracy})
        \item If the level is even, all of your \glossterm{defenses} increase by 1 (see \pcref{Defenses})
        \item At 2nd level, and every 3 levels thereafter, you gain an additional \glossterm{attunement point} (see \pcref{Attunement Points}).
        \item At 3rd level, and every 6 levels thereafter, you gain a \glossterm{legacy item} upgrade (see \pcref{Legacy Items}).
        \item At 4th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, your maximum \glossterm{archetype rank} increases (see \pcref{Archetype Ranks}).
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Legacy Items}\label{Legacy Items}

        Over time, items associated with places and people of great power gain magical properties.
        This process takes place for you as you gain levels in addition to in the world as a whole.

        At 3rd level, you choose a nonmagical weapon, piece of armor, apparel item, or implement you own.
        That item becomes a \glossterm{legacy item}, and gains a magic item ability you choose.
        You do not have to \glossterm{attune} to your legacy item to gain its benefits.
        The ability's level must be no greater than 5th level, and it must be appropriate for the category of item you chose: weapon, armor, apparel, or implement.
        You do not have to precisely match the location of an apparel item.
        For example, you can choose an amulet as your legacy item and give it the effect of the \mitem{boots of translocation}.

        At 9th, 15th, and 21st level, your legacy item increases in power again.
        You choose an ability of the appropriate type with a level no greater than two levels higher than your level when you choose the ability.
        In addition, you can change all of your lower level legacy item abilities.
        Each ability must meet the same maximum level requirement that it had when you first chose it.
        You cannot create a legacy item with two versions of the same ability on it, such as armor with both the \textit{invulnerability} and \textit{greater invulnerability} properties.

        If you lose your legacy item, you must retrieve it to regain its power.
        There are rituals to facilitate this retrieval such as \ritual{seek legacy} and \ritual{retrieve legacy}.
        If your legacy item is \glossterm{destroyed}, you can designate a new item of the same type to be your legacy item, causing it to gain all of your legacy item abilities.
        Designating a new item in this way requires taking a \glossterm{long rest} while holding or wearing the replacement item.

        Your legacy item can be reforged by a skilled smith without losing its legacy item abilities.
        This can allow you to reforge legacy body armor with special materials, which is important at high levels.

        \parhead{Unique Legacy Items}
            Legacy items are fundamentally a reflection of the character who wields them.
            Their effects can be more unusual and complex than abilities on normal magic items, and they can have a larger effect on the way that character interacts with the world.
            As a player, you can work with your GM to create custom magical effects of an appropriate power that are a better reflection of your character's personality and powers than the magic item abilities that exist.
