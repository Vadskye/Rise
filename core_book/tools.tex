This potion contains the power of a 1st level \glossterm{targeted} spell that does not have the \glossterm{Attune} or \glossterm{Sustain} tags.
As a \glossterm{standard action}, you can spend an \glossterm{action point} to drink this potion.
When you do, if your \glossterm{power} is at least as high as this item's \glossterm{power}, the spell takes effect on you.
You are the only target of the spell.
If your \glossterm{power} is less than the item's \glossterm{power}, the overwhelming magical energy instead deals \glossterm{standard damage} \minus1d to you.

After this potion has been used, its magic is expended.
