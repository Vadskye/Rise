\chapter{Monsters}

Monsters are all of the various non-humanoid creatures that exist in the world of Rise.
Many of them are dangerous, and adventurers may need to fight them.
This chapter describes the rules for monsters, and the combat statistics for a variety of monsters.

\section{Monster Classes}

    Like player characters, monsters have levels in ``classes'' that represent their natural roles and abilities.
    There are four monster classes: adept, behemoth, skirmisher, and slayer.

    \subsection{Class Overviews}

        \parhead{Adept} An adept monster has unique special abilities that it relies on in combat.
        Allips, medusas, and nymphs are adept monsters.
        \parhead{Behemoth} A behemoth monster is extraordinarily resilient or durable.
        Behemoth monsters are typically larger than other monsters.
        Giants, hydras, and trolls are behemoth monsters.
        \parhead{Skirmisher} A skirmisher monster is highly mobile, and usually has special abilities allowing it to attack and retreat quickly.
        Ankhegs, hippogriffs, and phase spiders are skirmisher monsters.
        \parhead{Slayer} A slayer monster has powerful damaging abilities that allow it to kill its foes quickly.
        Orcs, minotaurs, and winter wolves are slayer monsters.
