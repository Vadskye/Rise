\chapter{The World of Altus}

Altus is a specific world that you can use to run a game of Rise.
It has a defined geography, countries, and legends.
Many of its specifics are left somewhat vague, which gives you the freedom to expand on it or modify it to suit the needs of your story.

Of course, you can also make your own entirely unique world!
The rules of Rise are not deeply tied to the specific world of Altus.
Beware that world-building can be difficult and time-consuming, so it's generally best to start small.
For example, you might find it easier to run a game set in an invented island off the main continent of Altus before you make a whole world from scratch.
That allows you to fall back on some of the existing countries and conventions if you need them.
