\begin{ability}[\nth{7}]{Control Weather}[\glossterm{Air}, \glossterm{Attune}]
When you cast this subspell, you choose a new weather pattern.
You can only choose weather which would be possible in the climate and season of the area you are in.
For example, you can normally create a thunderstorm, but not if you are in a desert.

When you complete the spell, the weather begins to take effect in a two mile radius cylinder-shaped zone centered on from your location.
After five minutes, your chosen weather pattern fully takes effect.

You can control the general tendencies of the weather, such as the direction and intensity of the wind.
You cannot control specific applications of the weather -- where lightning strikes, for example, or the exact path of a tornado.
Contradictory weather conditions are not possible simultaneously.

After the spell's effect ends, the weather continues on its natural course, which may cause your chosen weather pattern to end.
% TODO: This should be redundant with generic spell mechanics
If another ability would magically manipulate the weather in the same area, the most recently used ability takes precedence.
