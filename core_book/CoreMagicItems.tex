\chapter{Magic Items}

\section{Item Description Format}

    Each general type of magic item gets an overall description, followed by descriptions of specific items.

    General descriptions include notes on activation, random generation, and other material.
    The AD, hardness, hit points, and break DR are given for typical examples of some magic items.
    The AD assumes that the item is unattended and includes a \minus10 penalty for the item's effective Dexterity of \minus10.
    If a creature holds the item, use the creature's Dexterity in place of the \minus10 penalty.

    Some individual items, notably those that simply store spells and nothing else, don't get full-blown descriptions.
    Reference the spell's description for details, modified by the form of the item (potion, scroll, wand, and so on).
    Assume that the spell is cast at the minimum level required to cast it.

    Items with full descriptions have their abilities detailed, and each of the following topics is covered in notational form at the end of the description.

    \parhead{Aura} Most of the time, a Spellcraft check will reveal the school of magic associated with a magic item and the strength of the aura an item emits.
    This information (when applicable) is given at the beginning of the item's notational entry.
    See the Spellcraft skill for details.

    \subparhead{Ability Tags} Unless otherwise noted, an item's abilities have all tags included in the item's aura.

    \parhead{Requirements} The qualifications that must be met to create the item, %described in \pcref{Creating Magic Items}.

    \parhead{Market Price} This gold piece value, given following the word ``Price,'' represents the price someone should expect to pay to buy the item.
    The market price for an item that can be constructed with an item creation feat is usually equal to the base price plus the price for any components.

    \parhead{Cost to Create} The next part of a notational entry is the cost in gp to create the item, given following the word ``Cost.'' This information appears only for items with components which make their market prices higher than their base prices.
    The cost to create includes the costs derived from the base cost plus the costs of the components.

    Items without components do not have a ``Cost'' entry.
    For them, the market price and the base price are the same.
    The cost in gp is 1/2 the market price.

    \parhead{Weight} The notational entry for many wondrous items ends with a value for the item's weight.
    When a weight figure is not given, the item has no weight worth noting (for purposes of determining how much of a load a character can carry).

    \subsection{Armor Overview}

        Magic body armor and shields protect the wearer to a greater extent than their nonmagical equivalents.
        All magic armor has an enhancement bonus to improve your hit points and ability to resist attacks.
        In addition to an enhancement bonus, magic armor may have special properties or be made of an unusual material.

        Body armor is always created so that even if the type of armor comes with boots or gauntlets, these pieces can be switched for other magic boots or gauntlets.

        \subsubsection{Armor Enhancement Bonuses}\label{Armor Enhancement Bonuses}

            Magic armor can have enhancement bonuses ranging from \plus1 to \plus5.
            Each \plus1 of enhancement bonus increases your maximum hit points by an amount equal to the item's power, and grants you an additional defensive legend point each day.
            If you stop using the armor, you lose the legend points and your maximum hit points returns to its normal value.

            These legend points can only be gained once per day, regardless of the number of items you use.
            If you use both magic body armor and a magic shield, or change between different pieces of armor, use only the highest bonus that applies.
            If you change from a weaker magical item to a stronger magical item, you gain bonuses equal to the difference between the two items.

        \subsubsection{Prices}\label{Armor Prices}
            The prices of enhancement bonuses to armor are listed in \trefnp{Magic Armor Prices}, and the prices of magical properties are listed on \trefnp{Apparel Properties}.
            If armor has a magical property, the price of the property is added to the price of the armor.
            The number of properties on the armor cannot exceed the enhancement bonus of the armor.
            Additionally, the price of all properties cannot exceed twice the price of the enhancement bonus on the armor.

            \begin{dtable}

                \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth} {>{\ccol}X c c}

                    \bottomrule
                    \plus1 & 100 gp    & 2nd  \\
                    \plus2 & 500 gp    & 4th  \\
                    \plus3 & 2,500 gp  & 8th  \\
                    \plus4 & 12,500 gp & 12th \\
                    \plus5 & 62,500 gp & 16th \\
                \end{dtabularx}
            \end{dtable}

            \parhead{Base Power for Armor and Shields} The base power of a magic shield or magic armor with a magical property is given in the item description.
            For an item with only an enhancement bonus, the base power is equal to three times the enhancement bonus.
            If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a magical property, the higher of the two base powers must be met.

            \parhead{Shields} Shield enhancement bonuses do not act as accuracy or damage bonuses when the shield is used in a bash.
            However, a shield can be enhanced as a weapon.

            \parhead{Hardness and Hit Points} Each \plus1 of enhancement bonus adds 2 to an armor or shield's hardness and \plus10 to its hit points.

            \parhead{Activation} A character benefits from magic armor and shields in exactly the way a character benefits from nonmagical armor and shields -- by wearing them.
            Magical properties on body armor are usually activated if the character is hit or damaged, while magical properties on shields are usually activated if the character avoids an attack.

    \subsection{Rings}

        \parhead{Physical Description} Rings have no appreciable weight.
        Although exceptions exist that are crafted from glass or bone, the vast majority of rings are forged from metal -- usually precious metals such as gold, silver, and platinum.
        A typical ring has AD 13, 10 hit points, hardness 10, and a break DR of 25.

    \subsection{Scrolls}
        A scroll is a spell that has been stored in written form.
        You can use a scroll to cast the spell on the scroll, just like casting a spell you know.
        Once a scroll is used, the magic is drained from it, and it cannot be used again.

        \parhead{Physical Description} A typical scroll is a heavy sheet of fine vellum or high-quality paper.
        An area about 8 1/2 inches wide and 11 inches long is sufficient to hold one spell.
        The sheet is reinforced at the top and bottom with strips of leather slightly longer than the sheet is wide.
        A scroll holding more than one spell has the same width (about 8 1/2 inches) but is an extra foot or so long for each extra spell.
        A scroll has AD 9, 1 hit point, hardness 0, and a break DR of 8.

        To protect it from wrinkling or tearing, a scroll is rolled up from both ends to form a double cylinder.
        (This also helps the user unroll the scroll quickly.) The scroll is usually placed in a tube of ivory, jade, leather, metal, or wood.
        Most scroll cases are inscribed with magic symbols which often identify the owner or the spells stored on the scrolls inside.
        The symbols can also be used to hide magic traps.

        \parhead{Activation} Activating a scroll simply means casting the spell written on the scroll.
        This functions exactly like casting the spell normally, except that you must spend an item use and the scroll itself rather than a spell slot, and you do not need to know the spell.
        You use your own \glossterm{magical power} to determine the effects of the spell.
        You must holding the scroll and able to see and read the writing on it.

        \parhead{Activation Restrictions} To successfully activate a scroll, you must be able to cast spells of the same level with the same \glossterm{spell source} as the scroll.
        In addition, the spell on the scroll must be on your \glossterm{spell list} for that source.

        \parhead{Deciphering Scrolls} The writing on a scroll must be deciphered before a character can use it or know exactly what spell it contains.
        This requires a \ritual{read magic} ritual or a successful Spellcraft check (DR 20 \add double spell level).
        Deciphering a scroll to determine its contents does not activate the scroll.
        However, a scroll can be cursed or magically trapped to harm a creature trying to decipher it.

    \subsection{Potions and Oils}

        Potions and oils are magical liquids that can be activated to produce spell effects when drunk or used to coat a surface.
        Potions have their effects when drunk, and always target the creature drinking the potion.
        Oils have their effects when applied externally, and always target the creature or object the oil is applied to.
        Once activated, the magic in a potion or oil is expended and useless.

        Both potions and oils can only mimic the effects of \glossterm{targeted} spells with a casting time of a standard action or less.
        Some spells are useless to create as a potion or oil.
        For example, the \spell{suggestion} spell requires speaking a suggestion as part of casting the spell.
        Since the drinker of a \spell{suggestion} potion would not hear the suggestion used to cast the spell, such a potion would be useless.

        Once activated, the effects of a potion or oil function as if the target had cast the spell on itself.
        Neither the character activating the effect nor the target of the effect can make any decisions about the spell's effects, including concentrating on the effect.
        All decisions must be made by the creator of the potion when it is made.

        \parhead{Physical Description} A typical potion or oil consists of 3 ounces of liquid held in a ceramic or glass vial fitted with a tight stopper.
        The stoppered container is usually no more than 2 inches wide and 4 inches high.
        The vial has AD 13, 1 hit point, hardness 1, and a break DR of 12.
        Vials hold 3 ounces of liquid.

        \parhead{Identifying Potions and Oils}
        The magical aura on a potion or oil can be identified with a Spellcraft check (see \pcref{Spellcraft}), revealing the nature of the spell contained in the potion.
        If you sample a taste from the potion as you use the Spellcraft skill, you gain a \plus5 bonus to the Spellcraft check.
        You cannot accidentally activate the spell effect while sampling the potion, but you risk being poisoned or otherwise negatively effected if the potion is not as it seems.
        The \spell{identify} ritual can also be used to identify potions.

        Alternately, you can simply learn to identify potions by memory.
        Potions with the same spell effect from the same \glossterm{spell source} almost always have a similar appearance and taste.
        This can be dangerous if you encounter a liquid designed to look and taste like a potion it is not.

        \parhead{Activation} As a standard action, you can drink a potion, apply an oil to a creature or object within your \glossterm{reach}, or feed a potion to another willing creature within your reach.
        If you spend a magic item use, the spell contained takes effect at the same time that spells cast that round resolve.
        If you drink multiple potions or apply multiple oils at the same time, you can still only activate one of them.

        If you are physically unable to drink a potion or smear on oil, you cannot activate the item's effects.
        You can attempt to apply an oil to an unwilling target.
        To do so, you must make a touch attack against your target (see \pcref{Touch Attacks}).

        \parhead{Power} The \glossterm{power} for a standard potion or oil is normally equal to twice the spell level of the spell in the potion.
        It is possible to create potions and oils with a higher power than that minimum.
        For every 2 points by which the power of a potion or oil increases above the minimum for its spell level, the price doubles additively.
        For example, a potion of a 1st level spell with a power of 6 would cost 30 gp.

        \parhead{Mishaps} Extraordinarily powerful potions and oils can be dangerous to activate.
        When you activate a potion or oil, if the \glossterm{power} of the potion exceeds your level, roll 1d10 and subtract the difference between your level and the potion's power.
        Compare the result to \trefnp{Potion Mishaps}.

    \subsection{Wondrous Items}

        Wondrous items are items which are inherently magical in some way.

            \magicitemability{Active}[Standard action] If you shake this stone and ask a simple yes or no question, you receive an answer of either ``yes'', ``no'', or ``unclear''.
            The answer has a 75\% chance of being correct.
            If the answerstone is incorrect, it will answer ``yes'' or ``no'' randomly.
            After being asked a question once, it will always give the same answer to that question (and any sufficiently similar question) for 24 hours.

            The answerstone will always answer ``unclear'' if asked questions about events more than thirty minutes into the future or past, or farther than ten miles from its current location.
            It can only answer questions about observable quantities (including spells).

            Although answerstones are usually made of stone, they can also be made of other sturdy materials.
        \end{magicitemdef}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Truthstone}[Active]{3}{Divination [Knowledge]}{bone, metal, or stone}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Bag of Holding}{1}{Conjuration [Planar]}{textiles}
            \magicitemability{Passive} A bag of holding appears to be an unusually thick cloth sack.
            Objects completely inside the bag are nearly weightless, and do not change the bag's weight.
            There are three sizes of bags: Small, Medium, and Large.
            Each size of bag can hold an object or creature of its size, and has a limit on the weight it can contain.
            Any weight beyond the bag's weight limit is not negated, causing the bag to weigh more.
            The weight limits for each bag are shown in \trefnp{Bags of Holding}.
        \end{magicitemdef}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Bottle of Air}[Active]{1}{Conjuration [Creation]}{ceramics}
            This item appears to be a normal glass bottle with a cork.
            \magicitemability{Active}[Standard action] If you uncork the bottle, it continually fills itself with clean air for 1 hour.
            It will remain filled with clean air even if taken into an airless environment or environment with dangerous gases, allowing you to breathe from the bottle.
            Liquid can still fill the bottle, and the bottle will continuously bubble as air is created until the liquid is removed.
            If the bottle is corked (a standard action), it stops filling itself with air until activated again.
        \end{magicitemdef}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Candle of Truth}[Active]{2}{Enchantment [Compulsion, Mind]}{alchemy}
            This item appears to be a simple white candle.
            \magicitemability{Active}[Standard action] If you light this candle, it mimics the effect of the \spell{zone of truth} ritual.
            The zone lasts as long as the candle remains lit, which is normally 1 hour.
            If the candle is snuffed, the zone immediately ends.
            While lit, the candle does not burn down, and provides servicable candle-light.
        \end{magicitemdef}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Friendstone}[1500]{6}{Conjuration/Divination [Scrying, Teleportation]}{ceramics or stone}
            This item appears to be a glossy, smooth stone or ball of glass about three inches in diameter.
            \magicitemability{Active}[Standard action] If you press the stone to your forehead and speak your full name, you can attune to it.
            If you do, you can be summoned by a creature using the stone.
            This replaces the stone's attunement to any other creature.
            \magicitemability{Active}[Standard action] If you grasp the stone in your hand and throw it to the ground, you can activate it.
            if you do, you instantly teleport the creature attuned to the stone to the stone's location.
            The creature is granted a brief glimpse of the stone's surroundings, as if looking out through the stone, and may refuse the summoning.
            If the creature refuses, or if it is physically impossible for the creature to appear, your activation of the stone has no effect.
            If the creature accepts, the stone is destroyed and the creature is unerringly teleported into the stone's location.
            The creature must be on the same plane as the stone, but the teleportation works across any distance.
        \end{magicitemdef}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Witch's Broom}[Passive]{7}{Divination/Transmutation [Communication, Imbuement]}{wood}
            \magicitemability{Passive} This broom has a 30 foot fly speed with good maneuverability.
            You can ride the broom to fly.
            Riding the broom is like riding a mount, except that you control it perfectly and some actions (such as taking cover behind the mount) are infeasible due to the shape of the broom.
            It can carry up to 1,000 pounds before it becomes unable to fly.
            \magicitemability{Active}[Standard action] As a standard action, you can speak a command word to summon the broom.
            If you do, and the broom is within \rngext range, it flies next to you and hovers at a convenient height to ride.
            The broom must be able to hear the commmand word.
        \end{magicitemdef}

\section{Special Materials}

    Some materials are inherently magical.
    Items made from such materials gain special properties automatically.

    \subsection{Material Types}
        There are three main types of materials used to create items: metal, wood, and leather.
        In order to create an item with a special material, the item must normally be made with a material of the appropriate material type.
        In the case of items that are made from multiple materials, such as polearms, the primary functional part of the item determines which type of special material can be used to create it.
        For example, the material type for a weapon is generally determined by its striking surface.

    \subsection{Special Material Descriptions}

        \begin{dtable*}

                Silvered    & Metal   & Effective against supernatural creatures    & 100 gp (3rd) & 200 gp (3rd) \\
            \end{dtabularx}
        \end{dtable*}

        \parhead{Adamantine}
        Adamantine is a rare metal that is among the hardest substances known.

        Adamantine weapons ignore the \glossterm{hardness} of creatures and objects.

        Adamantine body armor grants its wearer damage reduction against physical damage equal to the item's \glossterm{power} (see \pcref{Item Power}).
        This damage reduction is overcome by adamantine weapons.
        Adamantine shields have no special effects.

        Adamantine items of any kind have double the hit points and hardness of an equivalent item of the same type.

        \parhead{Cold Iron}

        Cold iron is iron that has been magically smelted without the use of heat.

        Cold iron items are especially effective against some supernatural creatures, as indicated in the creature descriptions.
        In addition, cold iron items have inherent \glossterm{magic resistance} equal to 10 \add the item's power.
        This magic resistance is unique to the item, and is not granted to its user.
        However, the maximum number and price of magical properties that can be imbued into the armor is halved.

        When you damage a creature with a cold iron weapon, it is \impaired with casting arcane spells for 2 rounds.

        Cold iron body armor grants its wearer immunity to \glossterm{Compulsion} and \glossterm{Delusion} effects.
        Cold iron shields have no special effects.

        \parhead{Dragonbone}

        Dragon bones can be used in place of metal when creating weapons and armor.

        Dragonbone weapons grant twice the normal number of offensive legend points from their enhancement bonus.
        This does not affect the damage dealt by the weapon.

        Dragonbone armor grants its wearer \glossterm{magic resistance} equal to 10 \add the \glossterm{power} of the item (see \pcref{Item Power}).

        \parhead{Dragonhide}

        Dragon hide can be used as leather when creating armor.

        Dragonhide body armor grants damage reduction equal to your level against the energy type used by the dragon the hide is taken from.

        \parhead{Dragonscale}

        Dragon scales can be used in place of metal when creating armor.

        Dragonscale armor grants damage reduction equal to your level against the energy type used by the dragon the hide is taken from.

        \parhead{Ironwood}
        Ironwood is a magic wood created by the \spell{ironwood} ritual.
        It has been magically hardened, giving it the strength of iron.
        Ironwood can be used in place of metal when creating weapons and armor.

        Ironwood items have no special properties except that they are made from wood instead of metal.

        \parhead{Mithral}
        Mithral is a rare metal that is very light, but has the strength of iron.

        Mithral weapons have the Finesse weapon property, allowing you to apply your Dexterity instead of your Strength when determining your accuracy with physical attacks using the weapon, even if it isn't a light weapon for you.

        Mithral armor has its \glossterm{encumbrance penalty} reduced by 2, and its arcane spell failure reduced by 10.

        Mithral items of any kind weigh half as much of an equivalent item of the same type.

        \parhead{Silvered}

        Silvered items have silver infused into them in the process of their creation.
        Only metal items made of iron or steel can be silvered.

        Silvered items are especially effective against some supernatural creatures, as indicated in the creature descriptions.
        However, silvered weapons deal damage as if they were one size category smaller, and mithral armor has its defense bonus reduced by 1.

\section{Magic Item Rules}

    \subsection{Magic Item Auras}

        Magic items radiate magical auras which can be detected with the Spellcraft skill (see \pcref{Spellcraft}).
        Each item describes the auras that can be detected on it, including the strength, school, and descriptors, as appropriate.

    \subsection{Damaging Magic Items}

        A magic item is normally unharmed by attacks unless it is unattended or is specifically targeted by an effect.
        % This is intentionally high to keep magic items durable
        A magic item's Fortitude and Mental defenses are all equal to 5 \add the \glossterm{power} of the item.
        % The only exceptions to this are intelligent magic items, which apply their Willpower to their Mental defense.

        Magic items, unless otherwise noted, take damage as nonmagical items of the same sort.
        A damaged magic item continues to function, but if it is \glossterm{broken}, its magic ceases to function until it is repaired.
        If it is destroyed, all its magical power is lost.

    \subsection{Repairing Magic Items}

        A magic item which is \glossterm{broken} (but not destroyed) can be repaired for 10\% of the value of the item.

    \subsection{Intelligent Items}

        Some magic items, particularly weapons, have an intelligence all their own.
        Only permanent magic items (as opposed to those with a single use or those with charges) can be intelligent.
        (This means that potions, scrolls, and wands, among other items, are never intelligent.)

        In general, fewer than 1\% of magic items have intelligence.

    \subsection{Cursed Items}

        Some items are cursed -- incorrectly made, or corrupted by outside forces.
        Cursed items might be particularly dangerous to the user, or they might be normal items with a minor flaw, an inconvenient requirement, or an unpredictable nature.
        Many cursed items are difficult to identify and remove, requiring the use of rituals such as \spell{remove curse}.
