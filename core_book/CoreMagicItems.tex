\chapter{Magic Items}

Magic items are objects that have been imbued with magical energy. They can take almost any form, and their potential uses are only as limited as the magic that created them.

\section{Magic Item Types}
    Magic items are divided into three broad categories:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Apparel items provide access to their abilities while worn.
            A \mitem{flaming burst full plate} and a \mitem{ring of protection} are apparel items.
        \item Weapons are used to make physical attacks. They provide access to their abilities when wielded.
            A \mitem{\plus1 flaming longsword} and a \mitem{\plus3 vampiric scythe} are weapons.
        \item Implements are used to cast spells. They provide access to their abilities when wielded and attuned to.
            A \mitem{\plus2 staff of fire} and a \mitem{\plus5 staff of time} are implements.
        \item Tools provide access to their abilities when used in some way.
            A \mitem{bag of holding} is a tool.
    \end{itemize}

\section{Using Magic Items}

    To use a magic item, it must be activated, although sometimes activation simply means wearing or holding the item.

    \subsection{Daily Item Activations}
        In general, you can activate any combination of magic items you possess a number of times per day equal to half your level (minimum 1).
        Once you have used up your activations for the day, you can't activate any more magic items until the next day, though you can continue to use items that don't require activation (such as most magic weapons) normally.

    \subsection{Activation Methods}
        Magic items can be activated in one of four ways:

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Command word
            \item Specific action
            \item Spell completion
            \item Triggered
        \end{itemize}

        These methods are described below.

        \parhead{Command Word} A character must speak a special word defined by the item to activate it.
        Unless otherwise stated, activating a command word magic item is a standard action.

        \parhead{Specific Action} A character must perform a specific action defined by the item to activate it.
        For example, a creature might need to drink the item, wrap its cloak around itself, or perform some other task.
        The activation time for such items can be varied.
        Unless otherwise stated, activating a specific action magic item is a standard action.

        \parhead{Spell Completion} A character must complete a spell defined by the item to activate it.
        Unless otherwise stated, activating a spell completion magic item is a standard action.
        Both verbal and somatic components may be required, as appropriate to the spell to be completed.

        In order to activate a spell completion item, a character must be able to cast spells of that level and she must have that spell on his spell list.

        \parhead{Triggered} A creature must fulfill some triggering condition defined by the item to activate it.
        For example, a triggered magic item might activate when a character strikes a foe, is damaged, or is affected by a particular kind of magic.
        Unless otherwise stated, activating a triggered item is an immediate action.
        It is done completely mentally, requiring no physical action, so it can be done even while paralyzed.
        Some triggered items activate automatically, without requiring an action of any kind.

\section{Magic Item Effects}
    Most magic items either provide numerical bonuses or emulate the effect of a spell in some way.

    \subsection{Item Power}\label{Item Power}
        The strength of an item's effects depends on its item power.
        If the item is not being used or worn by a creature, its item power is equal to its minimum power.
        If it is being used or worn by a creature, its item power is equal its minimum power or the level of the creature, whichever is higher.

        In addition to modifying an item's special effects, item power also affects an item's defenses.
        An item's Fortitude and Mental defenses are equal to 10 \add its item power.
        Its Armor defense and Reflex defense are not affected by item power, and are solely determined by the item's size and shape.

    \subsection{Removing Magic Items}
        Unless otherwise noted, magic items that have effects on the creature using the item must continue to be worn or held as long as the effect lasts.
        If a magic item is removed before its effect's duration is up, the effect ends.
        Items which are consumed when used or which do not affect their user are unaffected by this rule.

    \subsection{Special Attacks}
        If a magic item requires a successful special attack to have its full effect, the accuracy is listed in the item's description.
        Typically, the accuracy is equal to the item's power.

\section{Item Description Format}

    Each general type of magic item gets an overall description, followed by descriptions of specific items.

    General descriptions include notes on activation, random generation, and other material.
    The AD, hardness, hit points, and break DR are given for typical examples of some magic items.
    The AD assumes that the item is unattended and includes a \minus10 penalty for the item's effective Dexterity of \minus10.
    If a creature holds the item, use the creature's Dexterity in place of the \minus10 penalty.

    Some individual items, notably those that simply store spells and nothing else, don't get full-blown descriptions.
    Reference the spell's description for details, modified by the form of the item (potion, scroll, wand, and so on).
    Assume that the spell is cast at the minimum level required to cast it.

    Items with full descriptions have their abilities detailed, and each of the following topics is covered in notational form at the end of the description.

    \parhead{Minimum Power} The next item in a notational entry gives the minimum power of the item.
    An item's minumum power can affect its item power when used (see \pcref{Item Power}).

    For potions and scrolls, the item's minimum power must be at least twice the level of the spell contained.
    Generally, an item's minimum power is the same as the minimum spellpower required to create the item.

    \parhead{Aura} Most of the time, a Spellcraft check will reveal the school of magic associated with a magic item and the strength of the aura an item emits.
    This information (when applicable) is given at the beginning of the item's notational entry.
    See the Spellcraft skill for details.

    \subparhead{Ability Tags} Unless otherwise noted, an item's abilities have all tags included in the item's aura.

    \parhead{Requirements} The qualifications that must be met to create the item, %described in \pcref{Creating Magic Items}.

    \parhead{Market Price} This gold piece value, given following the word ``Price,'' represents the price someone should expect to pay to buy the item.
    The market price for an item that can be constructed with an item creation feat is usually equal to the base price plus the price for any components.

    \parhead{Cost to Create} The next part of a notational entry is the cost in gp to create the item, given following the word ``Cost.'' This information appears only for items with components which make their market prices higher than their base prices.
    The cost to create includes the costs derived from the base cost plus the costs of the components.

    Items without components do not have a ``Cost'' entry.
    For them, the market price and the base price are the same.
    The cost in gp is 1/2 the market price.

    \parhead{Weight} The notational entry for many wondrous items ends with a value for the item's weight.
    When a weight figure is not given, the item has no weight worth noting (for purposes of determining how much of a load a character can carry).

\section{Apparel}

    \subsection{Apparel Item Limitations}

        There are a wide variety of magic items, but there is a limit to how many apparel items a character can wear at any given time.
        For humanoid-shaped creatures, there are four core areas on the body that can hold magic items: the arms, the head, the torso, and the legs.
        A creature can wear only one item in the hands, arms, and legs, but it can use two torso items, provided that they are not identical (such as two belts).
        In addition, it can wear a suit of armor and two magic rings (one on each hand), for a total of eight item slots.
        Any additional items worn do not function.

        Creatures with non-humanoid body structures may have different arrangement of items.
        For example, a wolf would be able to wear items on its head, its torso, and on two different sets of legs.
        Regardless of body shape or size, most creatures may not have more than eight item slots, and many have fewer.
        A list of common items and their placement on the body is given below.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Arm items:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Bracers, bracelets, gauntlets, and gloves.
                \end{itemize}
            \item Armor:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Body armor, shields
                \end{itemize}
            \item Head items:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Hats, headbands, and helmets
                \end{itemize}
            \item Leg items:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Boots and shoes.
                \end{itemize}
            \item Rings
            \item Torso items:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Amulets, belts, cloaks, mantles, necklaces, robes, shirts, and vests.
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}

        Of course, a character may carry or possess as many items of the same type as he wishes.
        However, additional equipped items beyond those listed above have no effect.

        A rare few apparel items can be ``worn'' without taking up space on a character's body.
        The description of an item indicates when it has this property.

    \subsection{Armor Overview}

        Magic body armor and shields protect the wearer to a greater extent than their nonmagical equivalents.
        All magic armor has an enhancement bonus to improve your hit points and ability to resist attacks.
        In addition to an enhancement bonus, magic armor may have special abilities or be made of an unusual material.

        Body armor is always created so that even if the type of armor comes with boots or gauntlets, these pieces can be switched for other magic boots or gauntlets.

        \subsubsection{Armor Enhancement Bonuses}\label{Armor Enhancement Bonuses}

            Magic armor can have enhancement bonuses ranging from \plus1 to \plus5.
            Each \plus1 of enhancement bonus grants temporary hit points equal the item's power, and grants you an additional defensive legend point each day.
            If you stop using the armor, you lose the temporary hit points and the legend points.

            These bonuses can only be gained once per day, regardless of the number of items you use.
            If you use both magic body armor and a magic shield, or change between different pieces of armor, use only the highest bonus that applies.
            If you change from a weaker magical item to a stronger magical item, you gain bonuses equal to the difference between the two items.

        \subsubsection{Prices}\label{Armor Prices}
            The prices of enhancement bonuses to armor are listed in \trefnp{Magic Armor Prices}, and the prices of special abilities are listed on \trefnp{Apparel Special Abilities}.
            If armor has a special ability, the price of the special ability is added to the price of the armor.
            The number of special abilities on the armor cannot exceed the enhancement bonus of the armor.
            Additionally, the price of all special abilities cannot exceed twice the price of the enhancement bonus on the armor.

            \parhead{Base Power for Armor and Shields} The base power of a magic shield or magic armor with a special ability is given in the item description.
            For an item with only an enhancement bonus, the base power is equal to three times the enhancement bonus.
            If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability, the higher of the two base powers must be met.

            \parhead{Shields} Shield enhancement bonuses do not act as accuracy or damage bonuses when the shield is used in a bash.
            However, a shield can be enhanced as a weapon.

            \parhead{Hardness and Hit Points} Each \plus1 of enhancement bonus adds 2 to an armor or shield's hardness and \plus10 to its hit points.

            \parhead{Activation} A character benefits from magic armor and shields in exactly the way a character benefits from nonmagical armor and shields -- by wearing them.
            Special abilities on body armor are usually activated if the character is hit or damaged, while special abilities on shields are usually activated if the character avoids an attack.

            \magicitemability{Active}[Standard action] If you trace a circle in the air with this shield, it pulls in nearby ranged weapons.
            Whenever a creature within a \areasmall emanation of you would be attacked by a ranged weapon, the attack is redirected to target you instead.
            Resolve the attack as if it had initially targeted you, except that the attack is not affected by cover or concealment.
            Projectile and thrown objects that are Medium size or larger are not affected by this redirection.
        \end{magicitemdef}

            Its base power is equal to three times the item's penalty reduction.
            To craft the item, you must have a number of ranks in the relevant Craft skill equal to the item's base power \add 4.

            The protection from these bracers is treated as body armor, and does not stack with any other body armor you wear.

            If you are unable to control the figment with the glove, such as if you use the gloved hand for any other purpose, you lose your concentration on the figment.

    \subsection{Rings}

        \parhead{Physical Description} Rings have no appreciable weight.
        Although exceptions exist that are crafted from glass or bone, the vast majority of rings are forged from metal -- usually precious metals such as gold, silver, and platinum.
        A typical ring has AD 13, 10 hit points, hardness 10, and a break DR of 25.

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Animal Friendship}[500]{1}[Ring]{Transmutation [Enhancement]}{bone, metal, or jewelry}
            \magicitemability{Passive} You gain a \plus4 bonus to Creature Handling checks.
        \end{magicitemdef}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Counterspells}[Active]{3}[Ring]{Abjuration [Thaumaturgy]}{crafting}
            \magicitemability{Active}[Standard action] If cast a \glossterm{targeted spell} while wear this ring on your index finger, the spell becomes stored in the ring instead of having its normal effect.
            The next time you (or another creature who wears the ring) becomes targeted by the stored spell, that spell is automatically counterspelled.
            This discharges the energy stored in the ring, and it becomes unable to counter spells until another spell is stored in it.

            The ring may only store one spell at a time.
            If a new spell is stored into the ring while another spell is already inside it, the new spell is stored and the old spell is discharged without effect.
            Storing a spell in the ring requires an item use, but countering a spell does not.
        \end{magicitemdef}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Energy Resistance}[Active]{1}[Ring]{Abjuration [Shielding]}{bone, metal, or jewelry}
            \magicitemability{Triggered}[Immediate action] When you would take \glossterm{energy damage}, you can activate this ring.
            If you do, you gain damage reduction against \glossterm{energy damage} equal to twice the item's power until the end of the round.

            After you activate this ability, the ring sheds light as a torch.
            The color of the light depends on the energy damage resisted: green for acid, blue for cold, yellow for electricity, red for fire, and white for none.
            This effect lasts for 5 rounds, during which time you cannot activate this ability again.
        \end{magicitemdef}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Heroic Vengeance}[Active]{3}[Ring]{Abjuration}{bone, metal, or jewelry}
            \magicitemability{Triggered}[Immediate action] When a foe within \rngmed range rolls a natural 20 on an attack against you, you can activate this item.
            If you do, the attacking creature takes 1d10 divine damage per item power.
        \end{magicitemdef}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Invisibility}[Active]{2}[Ring]{Illusion [Glamer]}{bone, metal, or jewelry}
            \magicitemability{Active}[Standard action] If you put the hand wearing this ring into a pocket or otherwise conceal it from sight, you gain the effects of the \spell{invisibility} spell for 5 rounds.
        \end{magicitemdef}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Nourishment}[Passive]{1}[Ring]{Conjuration/Transmutation [Creation, Temporal]}{bone, metal, or jewelry}
            \magicitemability{Passive} You continuously gain nourishment, and no longer need to eat or drink.

            \magicitemability{Passive} This ring has an enhancement bonus to improve your defenses.
            Each \plus1 of enhancement bonus grants temporary hit points equal the item's power, and grants you an additional defensive legend point each day.
            If you stop using the ring, you lose the temporary hit points and the legend points.
            The benefits of this ring function in the same way as enhancement bonuses on magic armor, and they not stack with those bonuses.

            These bonuses can only be gained once per day, regardless of the number of items you use.
            If you wear two rings, or change between different rings, use only the highest bonus that applies.
            If you change from a weaker magical item to a stronger magical item, you gain bonuses equal to the difference between the two items.

            \spellspecial The price of the ring depends on its enhancement bonus, as shown in the table below.
            Its base power is equal to three times its enhancement bonus.

            In addition, each \plus1 of enhancement bonus grants you an additional offensive legend point each day.

    \subsection{Weapon Enhancement Bonuses}\label{Weapon Enhancement Bonuses}

        Magic weapons can have enhancement bonuses ranging from \plus1 to \plus5.
        You gain a bonus to damage on physical attacks using a magic weapon equal to the weapon's enhancement bonus.
        In addition, each \plus1 of enhancement bonus grants you an additional offensive legend point each day.

        These legend points can only be gained once per day, regardless of the number of weapons you use.
        If you use multiple weapons at once, or change between different weapons, use only the highest number of legend points that applies.
        If you change from a weaker magical weapon to a stronger magical weapon, you gain legend points equal to the difference between the two enhancement bonuses.

        Offensive legend points gained from weapon enhancement bonuses do not stack with offensive legend points gained from implement enhancement bonuses.
        Use the higher of the two.

    \subsection{Weapon Prices}\label{Weapon Prices}
        The prices of enhancement bonuses to weapons are listed in \trefnp{Magic Weapon Prices}, and the prices of special abilities are listed on \trefnp{Weapon Special Abilities}.
        If a weapon has a special ability, the price of the special ability is added to the price of the weapon.
        The number of special abilities on the weapon cannot exceed the enhancement bonus of the weapon.
        Additionally, the price of all special abilities cannot exceed twice the price of the enhancement bonus on the weapon.

        \begin{dtable}

                \plus3 & 5,000 gp   & 10th \\

            \end{dtabularx}
        \end{dtable}

        \parhead{Base Power for Weapons} The base power of a magic weapon with a special ability is given in the item description.
        For an item with only an enhancement bonus, the base power is three times the enhancement bonus.
        If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability, the higher of the two base powers is used.

        \parhead{Hardness and Hit Points} Each \plus1 of enhancement bonus adds 2 to a weapon's hardness and \plus10 to its hit points.

        \parhead{Ranged Weapons and Ammunition} The enhancement bonus from a ranged weapon does not stack with the enhancement bonus from ammunition.
        Only the higher of the two enhancement bonuses applies.
        Special abilities are applied from both sources, as long as they are not identical.
        If conflicting special abilities exist, the special ability on the ammunition takes precedence.

        Magic ammunition loses its magic after being fired, whether it hits or misses.

        \parhead{Light Generation} Some magic weapons shed light equivalent to a light spell (bright light in a 20-foot radius, shadowy light in a 40-foot radius).
        The light on such weapons cannot normally be shut off.
        Some of the specific weapons detailed below always or never glow, as defined in their descriptions.

        \parhead{Activation} Usually, a character benefits from a magic weapon in the same way a character benefits from a mundane weapon -- by attacking with it.
        Special abilities on weapons are usually activated if the character strikes a foe with the weapon.

        \parhead{Magic Weapons and Critical Hits} Some weapon qualities and some specific weapons have an extra effect on a critical hit.
        These special effects function against creatures not subject to critical hits.
        When fighting against such creatures, roll for critical hits as you would against any other creature subject to critical hits.
        On a successful critical roll, apply the special effect, but do not multiply the weapon's regular damage.

            Any weapon special ability can be designated as a ``bane'' ability, causing it to only function against a specific kind of creature.
            In exchange, the ability costs half the normal price in raw materials to add to the weapon.

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Defending}[Passive]{2}[Melee]{Abjuration [Shielding]}{as weapon}
            \magicitemability{Passive} You can use the legend points granted by this weapon's enhancement bonus as defensive legend points, in addition to using them as offensive legend points.
            This stacks with any defensive legend points granted by armor, but not with other offensive legend points granted by weapons.
        \end{magicitemdef}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Disorienting}[Active]{6}[Melee, Ranged]{Enchantment [Compulsion, Mind]}{as weapon}
            \magicitemability{Triggered}[Immediate action] When you hit a foe with this weapon, you can activate it to make the struck creature \disoriented for 2 rounds.

            After you activate this ability, the weapon cackles gleefully.
            It cackles again every time you hit a foe with it.
            This effect lasts for 5 rounds, during which time you cannot activate this ability again.

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Longshot}[Passive]{2}[Ranged]{Transmutation [Enhancement]}{as weapon}
            \magicitemability{Passive} Ranged attacks with this weapon have twice the normal \glossterm{range increment}.

            \magicitemability{Active}[Immediate action] When you hit with a physical attack with this weapon, you can activate it.
            If you do, the struck creature takes 1d6 fire damage per two item power.

            This effect lasts for 5 rounds, during which time you cannot activate this ability again.
        \end{magicitemdef}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Freezing}[Active]{2}[Melee, Ranged]{Evocation [Cold]}{as weapon}
            \magicitemability{Active}[Immediate action] When you hit with a physical attack with this weapon, you can activate it.
            If you do, the struck creature takes 1d6 cold damage per two item power.

            After you activate this ability, the item radiates frigid cold, causing it to snuff out torches and other small fires within a 5 foot radius.
            This effect lasts for 5 rounds, during which time you cannot activate this ability again.
        \end{magicitemdef}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Forceful}[Active]{1}[Melee, Ranged]{Evocation [Telekinesis]}{as weapon}
            \magicitemability{Triggered}[Immediate action] When you damage a foe with this weapon, you can activate it.
            If you do, you make a shove attack against your target.
            You gain a bonus equal to the damage you dealt on the attack, and do not have to move with your foe to knock it back the full distance.

            After you activate this ability, the weapon is visibly sheathed in telekinetic force.
            This effect lasts for 5 rounds, during which time you cannot activate this ability again.
        \end{magicitemdef}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Fixating}[Active]{4}[Melee]{Divination}{as weapon}
            \magicitemability{Triggered}[Immediate action] If you strike the same foe with this weapon for three consecutive rounds, you can activate this weapon.
            If you do, your next attack with this weapon against the same target becomes a confirmed critical hit.
            This attack must be made within 1 round, or the benefit is lost.

            After you activate this ability, the weapon twists slightly in your hand to point towards the target, if it is nearby and visible.
            This effect lasts for 5 rounds, during which time you cannot activate this ability again.

            \magicitemability{Passive} This weapon deals \glossterm{nonlethal} damage.
            As a standard action, you may run your hand along the \glossterm{striking surface} of the weapon.
            This changes the weapon from dealing nonlethal damage to lethal damage, or vice versa.
        \end{magicitemdef}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Morphing}[Active]{1}[Melee, Ranged]{Transmutation [Shaping]}{as weapon}
            \magicitemability{Active}[Standard action] If you grab this weapon with both hands and strike it against your knee or another hard object while visualizing a different weapon type, this weapon transforms into the visualized weapon type.
            The new weapon type must be from the same weapon group as the weapon's original type.
            This weapon remains transformed until you transform it again.
        \end{magicitemdef}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Poisoning}[Active]{3}[Melee]{Conjuration/Transmutation [Creation, Temporal]}{as weapon}
            \magicitemability{Passive} This weapon has a small slot in its hilt (or similar gripping surface). Up to one ounce of liquid can be placed in the slot or removed as a standard action. A nonmagical liquid placed in this slot is kept fresh, decaying at a rate of one minute per day. In addition, a non-magical liquid worth less than 100gp can be quickly duplicated to coat the weapon's surface.
            \magicitemability{Active}[Swift action] If you press a small button on the hilt (or similar gripping surface) of this weapon, the weapon's striking surface becomes coated in the liquid stored in the weapon's slot.

            After you activate this ability, it takes 5 rounds for the weapon to create more liquid.
            During this time, you cannot activate this ability again.

            \magicitemability{Passive} This weapon functions like a \magicitem{poisoning} weapon, except that it can duplicate nonmagical liquids worth up to 1,000 gp.
            In addition, up to five different poisons can be stored within the weapon.
            When you coat the weapon with poison, you may choose which poison to use.
        \end{magicitemdef}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Rebounding}[Passive]{0}[Melee]{Conjuration [Teleportation]}{as weapon}
            \magicitemability{Passive} After being thrown or fired, a returning weapon teleports back to the creature that threw or fired it.
            It returns to the thrower just before the creature's next turn (and is therefore ready to use again in that turn).

            Catching a returning weapon when it comes back is a free action.
            If you can't catch it, the weapon drops to the ground in the square from which it was thrown.
        \end{magicitemdef}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Returning}[Passive]{2}[Melee]{Conjuration [Teleportation]}{as weapon}
            \magicitemability{Passive} This weapon functions like a \magicitem{returning} weapon, except that the weapon teleports back to the creature that threw or fired it immediately after the attack is resolved, allowing the creature to make multiple attacks in the same round with the same thrown weapon.
        \end{magicitemdef}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Speed}[Passive]{5}[Melee, Ranged]{Transmutation [Temporal]}{as weapon}
            \magicitemability{Passive} Whenever you make a \glossterm{standard attack} with this weapon, you can make an additional \glossterm{strike} with a \minus5 penalty to accuracy.
            This does not stack with any other effects which grant extra strikes.
        \end{magicitemdef}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Sweeping}[Active]{0}[Melee]{Transmutation [Enhancement]}{as weapon}
            \magicitemability{Triggered}[Immediate action] When you hit a foe with a melee attack with this weapon, you can activate it.
            If you do, you can make an extra \glossterm{strike} at another creature you threaten.

            After you activate this ability, the weapon always feels slightly loose in your hands, no matter how tightly you grip it.
            This effect lasts for 5 rounds, during which time you cannot activate this ability again.
        \end{magicitemdef}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Soulreaving}[Passive]{7}[Melee, Ranged]{Necromancy [Soul]}{as weapon}
            \magicitemability{Passive} Attacks with this weapon ignore all damage reduction and hardness, but do not immediately deal hit point damage.
            In fact, a creature struck by the weapon does not feel the attack at all.
            Damage that would be dealt by the weapon can be delayed indefinitely.
            While the damage is delayed, it cannot be removed by any means short of the creature's death and resurrection.

            A soulreaving weapon has no effect on objects or constructs.
            While wielded, it has physical form only for its wielder, making it impossible to disarm.
            While not in use, it can be picked up and touched normally.

            \magicitemability{Triggered}[Immediate] If you strike yourself in the heart with the weapon, you can activate it.
            If you do, the delayed damage is converted into real damage.
            This deals no damage to you, but any other creatures that have been dealt damage by the weapon immediately the delayed damage the weapon has stored up for them.
            Any such damage dealt in excess of the creature's hit points is converted directly into critical damage.
            This removes all delayed damage the weapon has dealt.
        \end{magicitemdef}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Shocking}[Active]{2}[Melee, Ranged]{Evocation [Electricity]}{as weapon}
            \magicitemability{Active}[Immediate action] When you hit with a physical attack with this weapon, you can activate it.
            If you do, the struck creature takes 1d6 electricity damage per two item power.

            After you activate this ability, the item crackles with electrical energy, causing you to radiate flashing light as a torch.
            This effect lasts for 5 rounds, during which time you cannot activate this ability again.
        \end{magicitemdef}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Surestrike}[Active]{1}[Melee, Ranged]{Divination [Knowledge]}{as weapon}
            \magicitemability{Triggered}[Immediate action] When you miss an attack with this weapon, you can activate it to reroll the attack roll.
            You must take the second result.

            After you activate this ability, you see shadowy glimpses of alternate futures superimposed over objects and creatures you see.
            This effect lasts for 5 rounds, during which time you cannot activate this ability again.
        \end{magicitemdef}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Thieving}[Active]{3}[Melee]{Transmutation [Shaping, Sizing]}{as weapon}
            \magicitemability{Triggered}[Immediate action] When you strike an unattended object with this weapon, if the object is at least one size category smaller than the weapon, you may activate the weapon.
            If you do, the object is absorbed into the weapon, leaving no trace that it ever existed.
            If you use this weapon to make a successful disarm attempt, the disarmed object is considered unattended, allowing you to activate the weapon to absorb the object.

            \magicitemability{Passive} Items absorbed by the weapon remain stored in the weapon indefinitely.
            As a standard action, you can run your hand along the length of the striking surface of the weapon.
            If you do, the last item absorbed by the weapon appears in your hand.

            The weapon can hold no more than three objects at once.
            If you attempt to absorb an object while the weapon is full, the attempt fails.
        \end{magicitemdef}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Thundering}[Active]{2}[Melee, Ranged]{Evocation [Sonic]}{as weapon}
            \magicitemability{Active}[Standard action] If you speak a command word, you can imbue this weapon with a rumbling sonic energy and make a single strike with it.
            The next time you hit with the weapon, it emits a deafening thundering noise.
            When it does, all creatures within 10 feet of the struck creature, excluding yourself, are \deafened for 2 rounds.

            If the attack misses, the weapon continues to rumble threateningly for up to 5 rounds.
        \end{magicitemdef}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Transforming}[Active]{3}[Melee, Ranged]{Transmutation}{as weapon}
            \magicitemability{Active}[Standard action] This weapon functions like a \magicitem{morphing} weapon, except that the weapon's new type may be from any weapon group.
        \end{magicitemdef}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Vampiric}[Active]{2}[Melee]{Necromancy [Life]}{as weapon}
            \magicitemability{Active}[Move action] If you lick the striking part of this weapon, you regain hit points equal to the damage dealt by the weapon on its last successful attack.
            If the weapon has not dealt damage in the past round, you regain no hit points.
        \end{magicitemdef}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Vorpal}[Passive]{8}[Melee]{Transmutation [Enhancement]}{as weapon}
            \magicitemability{Passive} When you roll a natural 20 with this weapon, you deliver a vorpal blow.
            You immediately make any number of additional strikes against the struck creature until you miss a strike or hit with 10 successful strikes.
            All damage dealt in this way is considered to come from a single attack.
            This effect replaces the normal benefits of delivering a critical hit.
        \end{magicitemdef}

\section{Implements}
    Implements can take many forms: staffs, wands, holy symbols, and more.
    Like weapons, implements must be wielded to gain their effects.
    However, while weapons are used to deal physical damage to enemies, implements are used to cast spells.
    All magical implements have an enhancement bonus to improve your spell damage.
    In addition to an enhancement bonus, magical implements may have a single special ability.

    \subsection{Implement Enhancement Bonuses}\label{Implement Enhancement Bonuses}

        Magical implements can have enhancement bonuses ranging from \plus1 to \plus5.
        Each \plus1 of enhancement bonus grants the ability to cast a spell without expending a spell slot once per day.
        You can use this ability to replace a spell slot of any level of spells you can cast.
        This does not take an action, besides the action normally required to cast the spell, or an item use.

        In addition, each \plus1 of enhancement bonus grants you an additional offensive legend point each day.
        These legend points can only be gained once per day, regardless of the number of implements you use.
        If you use multiple implements at once, or change between different implements, use only the highest number of legend points that applies.
        If you change from a weaker magical implement to a stronger magical implement, you gain legend points equal to the difference between the two enhancement bonuses.

        Offensive legend points gained from weapon enhancement bonuses do not stack with offensive legend points gained from implement enhancement bonuses.
        Use the higher of the two.

        \parhead{Implement Prices} The prices of enhancement bonuses to implements are listed in \trefnp{Implement Prices}, and the prices of special abilities are listed on \trefnp{Implement Special Abilities}.
        If an implement has a special ability, the price of the special ability is added to the price of the staff.
        An implement can only have one special ability, and the price of that special ability cannot exceed twice the price of the enhancement bonus on the implement.

        \begin{dtable}
            \lcaption{Implement Prices}
            \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth} {>{\ccol}X c c}

                \hline
                \plus1 & 150 gp    & 3rd  \\
                \plus2 & 800 gp    & 5th  \\
                \plus3 & 4,000 gp  & 9th  \\
                \plus4 & 20,000 gp & 13th \\
                \plus5 & 95,000 gp & 17th \\
            \end{dtabularx}
        \end{dtable}

        \parhead{Somatic Components} While wielding an implement, you may gesture with it and channel magic through it.
        These qualify as somatic components for the purpose of casting spells.

        \parhead{Spells Known and Attunement} Magical implements can provide additional spells known.
        Gaining access to the spells known from an implement requires attuning to it, which takes 10 minutes of concentration and an item use.
        Attunement lasts until you attune to a different implement.
        While you are attuned to an implement you wield, you gain access to additional spells known, as given in the description of the item.

        You must have be able to cast and learn spells of a given level to learn and cast spells of that level from an implement.

    \subsection{Implement Types}

        \subsubsection{Holy Symbols}

            \parhead{Physical Description} A typical holy symbol is a no larger than 4 inches in each dimension and can be easily held in the palm of a hand.
            Most holy symbols are metal, but they can be made from wood, bone, or even more exotic materials, depending on the deity they symbolize.

            \parhead{Special Rules} All holy symbols are divine implements.
            Most holy symbols are designed to be worn as an amulet in addition to being held in the hand.
            When worn in this way, the holy symbol occupies a torso body slot.
            A holy symbol worn on the body cannot be used to perform somatic components for spellcasting.
            However, it still grants enhancement bonuses and spells known as if it was being actively wielded.

        \subsubsection{Staffs}

            \parhead{Physical Description} A typical staff is 4 feet to 7 feet long and 2 inches to 3 inches thick, weighing about 5 pounds.
            Most staffs are wood, but a rare few are bone, metal, or even glass.
            (These are extremely exotic.)
            Staffs often have a gem or some device at their tip or are shod in metal at one or both ends.

            Staffs are often decorated with carvings or runes.
            A typical staff is like a walking stick, quarterstaff, or cudgel.
            It has AC 7, 10 hit points, hardness 5, and a break DR of 24.

        \subsubsection{Wands}

            \parhead{Physical Description} A typical wand is 6 inches to 12 inches long and about 1/4 inch thick, and often weighs no more than 1 ounce.
            Most wands are wood, but some are bone.
            A rare few are metal, glass, or even ceramic, but these are quite exotic.
            Occasionally, a wand has a gem or some device at its tip, and most are decorated with carvings or runes.
            A typical wand has AC 7, 5 hit points, hardness 5, and a break DR of 16.

            \parhead{Special Rules}
            Unlike most spellcasting implements, enhancement bonuses from wands wands only affect spells from a particular school of magic (see \pcref{Schools of Magic}), or spells with a particular tag (see \pcref{Ability Tags}).
            The prices for enhancement bonuses on wands are correspondingly lower, as given on \trefnp{Wand Prices}.

            \subparhead{Multiple Schools} Some rare wands provide bonuses to two schools.
            The enhancement bonus on a wand costs twice as much if it provides bonuses to two schools.
            A wand cannot provide an enhancement bonus to more than two schools.

    \subsection{Scrolls}
        A scroll is a spell (or collection of spells) that has been stored in written form.
        A spell on a scroll can be used only once.
        The writing vanishes from the scroll when the spell is activated.
        Using a scroll is basically like casting a spell.

        \parhead{Physical Description} A scroll is a heavy sheet of fine vellum or high-quality paper.
        An area about 8 1/2 inches wide and 11 inches long is sufficient to hold one spell.
        The sheet is reinforced at the top and bottom with strips of leather slightly longer than the sheet is wide.
        A scroll holding more than one spell has the same width (about 8 1/2 inches) but is an extra foot or so long for each extra spell.
        Scrolls that hold three or more spells are usually fitted with reinforcing rods at each end rather than simple strips of leather.
        A scroll has AC 9, 1 hit point, hardness 0, and a break DR of 8.

        To protect it from wrinkling or tearing, a scroll is rolled up from both ends to form a double cylinder.
        (This also helps the user unroll the scroll quickly.) The scroll is placed in a tube of ivory, jade, leather, metal, or wood.
        Most scroll cases are inscribed with magic symbols which often identify the owner or the spells stored on the scrolls inside.
        The symbols often hide magic traps.

        \parhead{Activation} To activate a scroll, a spellcaster must read the spell written on it.
        Doing so involves several steps and conditions.

        \parhead{Decipher the Writing} The writing on a scroll must be deciphered before a character can use it or know exactly what spell it contains.
        This requires a \ritual{read magic} ritual or a successful Spellcraft check (DR 20 \add spell level).

        Deciphering a scroll to determine its contents does not activate its magic unless it is a specially prepared cursed scroll.
        A character can decipher the writing on a scroll in advance so that he or she can proceed directly to the next step when the time comes to use the scroll.

        \parhead{Activate the Spell} Activating a scroll requires reading the spell from the scroll.
        The character must be able to see and read the writing on the scroll.
        Activating a scroll spell requires no material components or focus.
        (The creator of the scroll provided these when scribing the scroll.) Note that some spells are effective only when cast on an item or items.
        In such a case, the scroll user must provide the item when activating the spell.
        Activating a scroll spell is subject to disruption just as casting a normally prepared spell would be.
        Using a scroll is like casting a spell for purposes of arcane spell failure chance.

        To have any chance of activating a spell scroll, the scroll user must meet the following requirements.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The user's spellpower must be at least equal to the scroll's spellpower.
            \item The user must have the spell on his or her spell list.
                The spell list must be of the same magic type as the scroll (arcane, divine, or nature).
            \item The user must have the minimum casting attribute required to cast spells of the scroll's spell level.
                For arcane magic, the minimum attribute is equal to the spell's level.
                For divine and nature magic, the minimum attribute is equal to half the spell's level.
        \end{itemize}

        \parhead{Determine Effect} A spell successfully activated from a scroll works exactly like a spell cast the normal way.
        The spellpower of a spell cast from a scroll is equal to twice the spell's level.

        Once a scroll has been activated, the writing disappears from it, leaving behind only faint traces with no magical power.

        \parhead{Scroll Levels} Some spells are acquired by multiple classes at different levels.
        Use the entry on the table appropriate to the scribing of each individual scroll.

            1 Includes arcane, divine, and nature spells.  \\
        \end{dtable}

    \subsection{Potions and Oils}

        Potions and oils are magical liquids that can be activated to produce spell effects when drunk or used to coat a surface.
        Potions have their effects when drunk, and always target the creature drinking the potion.
        Oils have their effects when applied externally, and always target the creature or object the oil is applied to.
        Once activated, the magic in a potion or oil is expended and useless.

        Both potions and oils can only mimic the effects of \glossterm{targeted spells} with a casting time of a standard action or less.

        Once activated, the effects of a potion or oil function as if the target had cast the spell on itself.
        Neither the character activating the effect nor the target of the effect can make any decisions about the spell's effects, including concentrating on the effect.
        All decisions must be made by the creator of the potion when it is made.

        \parhead{Physical Description} A typical potion or oil consists of 3 ounces of liquid held in a ceramic or glass vial fitted with a tight stopper.
        The stoppered container is usually no more than 2 inches wide and 4 inches high.
        The vial has AC 13, 1 hit point, hardness 1, and a break DR of 12.
        Vials hold 3 ounces of liquid.

        \parhead{Identifying Potions and Oils}
        The magical aura on a potion or oil can be identified with a Spellcraft check (see \pcref{Spellcraft}), revealing the nature of the spell contained in the potion.
        If you sample a taste from the potion as you use the Spellcraft skill, you gain a \plus5 bonus to the Spellcraft check.
        You cannot accidentally activate the spell effect while sampling the potion, but you risk being poisoned or otherwise negatively effected if the potion is not as it seems.
        The \spell{identify} ritual can also be used to identify potions.

        Alternately, you can simply learn to identify potions by memory.
        Potions with the same spell effect from the same source of magic (arcane, divine, or nature) almost always have a similar appearance and taste.
        This can be dangerous if you encounter a liquid designed to look and taste like a potion it is not.

        \parhead{Activation} As a standard action, you can drink a potion, apply an oil to a creature or object within your \glossterm{reach}, or feed a potion to another willing creature within your reach.
        If you spend a magic item use, the spell contained takes effect at the same time that spells cast that round resolve.
        If you drink multiple potions or apply multiple oils at the same time, you can still only activate one of them.

        If you are physically unable to drink a potion or smear on oil, you cannot activate the item's effects.
        You can attempt to apply an oil to an unwilling target.
        To do so, you must make a touch attack against your target (see \pcref{Touch Attacks}).

        \parhead{Spellpower} The spellpower for a standard potion or oil is equal to twice the spell level of the spell in the potion.

        \parhead{Mishaps} Extraordinarily powerful potions and oils can be dangerous to activate.
        Whenever you activate a potion or oil, if the spellpower of the potion exceeds your level, roll 1d20 and subtract the difference between your level and the potion's spellpower.
        Compare the result to \trefnp{Potion Mishaps}.

        \begin{dtable}

                0 or below         & As above, and the potion does not have its normal effect \\

        Wondrous items are items which are inherently magical in some way.

            \magicitemability{Active}[Standard action] If you shake this stone and ask a simple yes or no question (a standard action), you receive an answer of either ``yes'', ``no'', or ``unclear''.
            The answer has a 75\% chance of being correct.
            If the answerstone is incorrect, it will always answer ``unclear''.
            The answerstone will always answer ``unclear'' if asked questions about events more than thirty minutes into the future or past, farther than ten miles from its current location.
            It can only answer questions about observable quantities (including spells).

            Although answerstones are usually made of stone, they can also be made of other sturdy materials.

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Bag of Holding}{1}{Conjuration [Planar]}{textiles}
            \magicitemability{Passive} A bag of holding appears to be a common cloth sack about 2 feet by 4 feet in size.
            It opens into an extradimensional space: its inside is larger than its outside dimensions.
            Regardless of what is put into the bag, it weighs a fixed amount.
            This weight, and the limits in weight and volume of the bag's contents, depend on the bag's type, as shown on \trefnp{Bag of Holding Types}.

            The walls inside the bag appear to be made from the same material as the outside, though they is significantly more durable.
            A five-foot square of interior wall has a hardness of 10 and 50 hit points.
            If the bag is overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce the bag from the inside or outside, it ruptures and is ruined.
            All its contents are lost forever.

            If a bag of holding is turned inside out, its contents spill out, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again.
            Retrieving a specific item from a bag of holding is a move action -- unless the bag contains more than an ordinary backpack would hold, in which case retrieving a specific item is a full-round action.

            If a bag of holding is placed within a portable hole, a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in the space. The bag and hole alike are sucked into the void and forever lost.
            If a portable hole is placed within a bag of holding, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, destroying the portable hole and bag of holding in the process.
        \end{magicitemdef}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Bottle of Air}[Active]{1}{Conjuration [Creation]}{ceramics}
            This item appears to be a normal glass bottle with a cork.
            \magicitemability{Active}[Standard action] If you uncork the bottle, it continually fills itself with clean air for 1 hour.
            It will remain filled with clean air even if taken into an airless environment or environment with dangerous gases, allowing you to breathe from the bottle.
            Liquid can still fill the bottle, and the bottle will continuously bubble as air is created until the liquid is removed.
            If the bottle is corked (a standard action), it stops filling itself with air until activated again.
        \end{magicitemdef}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Candle of Truth}[Active]{2}{Enchantment [Compulsion, Mind]}{alchemy}
            This item appears to be a simple white candle.
            \magicitemability{Active}[Standard action] If you light this candle, creatures within a \areamed radius of the candle are unable to lie, as the \spell{zone of truth} ritual.
            The zone lasts as long as the candle remains lit, which is normally 1 hour.
            If the candle is snuffed, the zone immediately ends.
            While lit, the candle does not burn down, and provides servicable candle-light.
        \end{magicitemdef}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Friendstone}[1500]{6}{Conjuration/Divination [Scrying, Teleportation]}{ceramics or stone}
            This item appears to be a glossy, smooth stone or ball of glass about three inches in diameter.
            \magicitemability{Active}[Standard action] If you press the stone to your forehead and speak your full name, you can attune to it.
            If you do, you can be summoned by a creature using the stone.
            This replaces the stone's attunement to any other creature.
            \magicitemability{Active}[Standard action] If you grasp the stone in your hand and throw it to the ground, you can activate it.
            if you do, you instantly teleport the creature attuned to the stone to the stone's location.
            The creature is granted a brief glimpse of the stone's surroundings, as if looking out through the stone, and may refuse the summoning.
            If the creature refuses, or if it is physically impossible for the creature to appear, your activation of the stone has no effect.
            If the creature accepts, the stone is destroyed and the creature is unerringly teleported into the stone's location.
            The creature must be on the same plane as the stone, but the teleportation works across any distance.
        \end{magicitemdef}

        \begin{magicitemdef}{Witch's Broom}[Passive]{7}{Divination/Transmutation [Communication, Imbuement]}{wood}
            \magicitemability{Passive} While you ride this broom, it can fly, as the \spell{overland flight} ritual.
            Riding the broom is like riding a mount, except that you do not need to control it and some actions (such as taking cover behind the mount) are infeasible due to the shape of the broom.
            It can carry up to 1,000 pounds before it becomes unable to fly.
            \magicitemability{Active}[Standard action] As a standard action, you can speak a command word to summon the broom.
            If you do, it flies next to you and hovers at a convenient height to ride.
            The broom must be able to hear the commmand word.
        \end{magicitemdef}

\section{Special Materials}

    Some materials are inherently magical.
    Items made from such materials gain special properties automatically.

    \subsection{Material Types}
        There are three main types of materials used to create items: metal, wood, and leather.
        In order to create an item with a special material, the item must normally be made with a material of the appropriate material type.
        In the case of items that are made from multiple materials, such as polearms, the primary functional part of the item determines which type of special material can be used to create it.
        For example, the material type for a weapon is generally determined by its striking surface.

    \subsection{Special Material Descriptions}

            \end{dtabularx}
        \end{dtable*}

        \parhead{Adamantine}
        Adamantine is a rare metal that is among the hardest substances known.

        Adamantine weapons ignore the \glossterm{hardness} of creatures and objects.

        Adamantine body armor grants its wearer damage reduction against physical damage equal to your item power.
        This damage reduction is overcome by adamantine weapons.
        Adamantine shields have no special effects.

        Adamantine items of any kind have double the hit points and hardness of an equivalent item of the same type.

        \parhead{Cold Iron}

        Cold iron is iron that has been magically smelted without the use of heat.

        Cold iron items are especially effective against some supernatural creatures, as indicated in the creature descriptions.
        In addition, cold iron items have inherent \glossterm{magic resistance} equal to 10 \add the item's power.
        This magic resistance is unique to the item, and is not granted to its user.
        However, the maximum number and price of special abilities that can be imbued into the armor is halved.

        When you damage a creature with a cold iron weapon, it is \impaired with casting arcane spells for 2 rounds.

        Cold iron body armor grants its wearer immunity to \glossterm{Compulsion} and \glossterm{Delusion} effects.
        Cold iron shields have no special effects.

        \parhead{Darkwood}
        Darkwood is a rare magic wood that is very light.

        Darkwood weapons have the Finesse weapon property, allowing you to apply your Dexterity instead of your Strength when determining your accuracy with physical attacks using the weapon, even if it isn't a light weapon for you.

        Darkwood shields have their \glossterm{encumbrance penalty} reduced by 2, and their arcane spell failure reduced by 10\%.

        Darkwood items of any kind weigh half as much as an equivalent item of the same type.

        \parhead{Dragonbone}

        Dragon bones can be used in place of metal when creating weapons and armor.

        Dragonbone weapons grant twice the normal number of offensive legend points from their enhancement bonus.
        This does not affect the damage dealt by the weapon.

        Dragonbone armor grants its wearer \glossterm{magic resistance} equal to 10 \add item power.

        \parhead{Dragonhide}

        Dragon hide can be used as leather when creating armor.

        Dragonhide body armor grants damage reduction equal to your level against the energy type used by the dragon the hide is taken from.

        \parhead{Dragonscale}

        Dragon scales can be used in place of metal when creating armor.

        Dragonscale armor grants damage reduction equal to your level against the energy type used by the dragon the hide is taken from.

        \parhead{Ironwood}
        Ironwood is a magic wood created by the \spell{ironwood} ritual.
        It has been magically hardened, giving it the strength of iron.
        Ironwood can be used in place of metal when creating weapons and armor.

        Ironwood items have no special properties except that they are made from wood instead of metal.

        \parhead{Mithral}
        Mithral is a rare metal that is very light, but has the strength of iron.

        Mithral weapons have the Finesse weapon property, allowing you to apply your Dexterity instead of your Strength when determining your accuracy with physical attacks using the weapon, even if it isn't a light weapon for you.

        Mithral armor has its \glossterm{encumbrance penalty} reduced by 2, and its arcane spell failure reduced by 10.

        Mithral items of any kind weigh half as much of an equivalent item of the same type.

        \parhead{Silvered}

        Silvered items have silver infused into them in the process of their creation.
        Only metal items made of iron or steel can be silvered.

        Silvered items are especially effective against some supernatural creatures, as indicated in the creature descriptions.
        However, silvered weapons deal damage as if they were one size category smaller, and mithral armor has its defense bonus reduced by 1.

\section{Magic Item Rules}

    \subsection{Magic Item Auras}

        Magic items radiate magical auras which can be detected with the Spellcraft skill (see \pcref{Spellcraft}).
        Each item describes the auras that can be detected on it, including the strength, school, and descriptors, as appropriate.

    \subsection{Damaging Magic Items}

        A magic item is normally unharmed by attacks unless it is unattended or is specifically targeted by an effect.
        A magic item's non-physical defenses are all equal to 10 \add the spellpower of the item.
        The only exceptions to this are intelligent magic items, which apply their Willpower to their Mental defense.

        Magic items, unless otherwise noted, take damage as nonmagical items of the same sort.
        A damaged magic item continues to function, but if it is broken, its magic ceases to function until it is repaired.
        If it is destroyed, all its magical power is lost.

    \subsection{Repairing Magic Items}

        A magic item which is broken (but not destroyed) can be repaired for 10\% of the value of the item.

    \subsection{Intelligent Items}

        Some magic items, particularly weapons, have an intelligence all their own.
        Only permanent magic items (as opposed to those with a single use or those with charges) can be intelligent.
        (This means that potions, scrolls, and wands, among other items, are never intelligent.)

        In general, fewer than 1\% of magic items have intelligence.

    \subsection{Cursed Items}

        Some items are cursed -- incorrectly made, or corrupted by outside forces.
        Cursed items might be particularly dangerous to the user, or they might be normal items with a minor flaw, an inconvenient requirement, or an unpredictable nature.
        Many cursed items are difficult to identify and remove, requiring the use of rituals such as \spell{remove curse}.
