\tooldescription{Bag of Tricks}{Varies}{see text}{Varied Conjuration (Summoning)}{}{\tdash} This small sack appears normal and empty.
However, anyone reaching into the bag feels a small, fuzzy ball.
If the ball is removed and tossed up to 20 feet away, it turns into an animal.
The animal serves the character who drew it from the bag for 1 minute (or until slain or ordered back into the bag), at which point it disappears.
It can follow any of the commands described in the Creature Handling skill.
Each of the three kinds of a bag of tricks produces a different set of animals.
Use the following tables to determine what animals can be drawn out of each.

Animals produced are always random, and only one may exist at a time.
If a new animal is drawn from the bag, the previous animal is immediately unsummoned.

        \tooldescription{Bead of Force}{600}{5th}{Moderate Evocation (Control) [Force]}{10th}{Standard (specific action)} This small black sphere appears to be a lusterless pearl.
        By holding it in your hand and throwing it at an object or creature, you can surround the struck target with a \spell{resilient sphere}, as the spell.
        The bead is treated as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 20 feet.
        Your Reflex attack bonus for the \spell{resilient sphere} effect is equal to your level \add 5.

        If you miss your target, the bead will still activate if it strikes a solid object, potentially wasting its effect.
        After being activated, the bead is destroyed.
