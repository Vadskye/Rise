\section{Weapons}\label{Weapons}

    Weapons are grouped into several interlocking sets of categories. These categories pertain to what weapon group the weapon belongs to (axes, bows, and so on), the weapon's usefulness either in close combat (melee) or at a distance (ranged, which includes both thrown and projectile weapons), and its relative encumbrance (light, medium, or heavy).

    \subsection{Weapon Groups}\label{Weapon Groups}

        Weapons are organized into thematically related categories called weapon groups. They are described in \trefnp{Weapon Groups}. For example, all axes belong to the ``axes'' weapon group. Some weapons can be found in multiple weapon groups. For example, a dagger is a simple weapon, a light blade, and a thrown weapon.

        \parhead{Exotic Weapons}\label{Exotic Weapons} Some weapons are rare and have unusual fighting styles.
        These weapons are called exotic weapons.
        Proficiency with a weapon group does not grant you with exotic weapons from that group.
        You can gain proficiency with exotic weapons with the Martial Training feat (see page \featpref{Martial Training}).

        \subsubsection{Weapon Proficiency}\label{Weapon Proficiency}
            Each character is proficient with different weapon groups. These indicate the weapons that you can use effectively. You take a \minus2 penalty to accuracy with weapons you are not proficient with, and you cannot use them to defend yourself, which can cause you to be \defenseless.

    \subsection{Weapon Encumbrance}\label{Weapon Encumbrance}
        This is a measure of how much effort it takes to wield a weapon in combat. A weapon's encumbrance indicates whether a melee weapon, when wielded by a creature the weapon is sized for, is considered a light weapon, a medium weapon, or a heavy weapon.

        \parhead{Light Weapons}\label{Light Weapons} You can use Dexterity to determine your \glossterm{accuracy} when making a \glossterm{physical attack} with a light weapon.
        In addition, light weapons are easier to use while making attacking with two weapons at once (see \pcref{Two-Weapon Strikes}) or while grappling.
        Light weapons cannot be held in two hands.

        \parhead{Medium Weapon} A medium weapon can be used in one hand. You can also hold a medium weapon in two hands. Changing grips to hold it in one hand or two hands can be done as a move action.

        \parhead{Heavy Weapon} Two hands are required to wield a heavy weapon. You can hold it in one hand, but while doing so you cannot attack or defend yourself with it. This usually causes you to be \defenseless. Changing grips to hold it in one hand or two hands is a move action.

        % TODO: explain how double weapons work

    \subsection{Melee Weapons}
        Melee weapons are used for making melee attacks against foes within your reach (see \pcref{Reach}). Most weapons are melee weapons.

    \subsection{Ranged Weapons}
        Ranged weapons are used to make attacks against distant foes within the range of your weapon. There are two kinds of ranged weapons: projectile weapons and thrown weapons.

        \subsubsection{Range Increments}\label{Range Increment} All ranged weapons have a ``range increment'', which indicates the distance at which you can effectively attack with the weapon. Any attack against a target within your range increment takes no penalty. For each range increment by which the target is distant from you, you take a cumulative \minus1 penalty to your accuracy. A thrown weapon has a maximum range of five range increments. A projectile weapon can shoot out to ten range increments.

        \subsubsection{Projectile Weapons} Projectile weapons fire ammunition at a target to deal damage. The ammunition generally breaks when used.

        \subsubsection{Thrown Weapons}\label{Thrown Weapons} Thrown weapons are thrown at a target to deal damage. They generally do not break when thrown.

            \parhead{Throwing Other Weapons} It is possible to throw a weapon that is not designed to be thrown. The range increment is 10 feet. You are treated as being nonproficient with the weapon. If the attack hits, the weapon deals its normal damage.

            \parhead{Heavy Weapons} Heavy thrown weapons require a standard action to throw, rather than an attack action like normal. They are not always physically thrown with two hands, but they require the use of your entire body to propel the weapon, preventing you from using your hands for anything else. This can cause you to be \defenseless.

        \subsubsection{Ranged Weapons in Melee}

            You take a \minus4 penalty to accuracy with medium and large ranged weapons against creatures adjacent to you. In addition, you are usually \defenseless while using ranged weapons.

            \parhead{Thrown Weapons in Melee}\label{Thrown Weapons in Melee} You cannot defend yourself with a weapon you are throwing, which can cause you to be \defenseless. To avoid this, you can attempt to use the weapon as a melee weapon. Some thrown weapon are not designed for use in melee, such as shurikens. When using such a weapon as a melee weapon, you are always treated as nonproficient with it, which means you cannot defend yourself with it.

            \parhead{Physical Size} Like all objects and creatures, weapons have a size category that represents how physically large they are. In general, a light weapon is an object two size categories smaller than the wielder, a medium weapon is an object one size category smaller than the wielder, and a heavy weapon is an object of the same size category as the wielder.

            \parhead{Inappropriately Sized Weapons}\label{Inappropriately Sized Weapons} A weapon's encumbrance is altered by one step for each size category of difference between the wielder's size and the size of the creature for which the weapon was designed.
            For example, a light weapon sized for a Large creature can be used by a Medium creature as if it had medium encumbrance.
            The wielder also gains a \plus1d bonus to damage with the weapon per size category if the weapon is unusually large, or a \minus1d penalty to damage with the weapon if the weapon is unusually small.
            In addition, the wielder takes a \minus2 penalty to accuracy with the weapon per size category of difference.
            If a weapon's encumbrance would be changed to something other than light, medium, or heavy by this alteration, the creature can't wield the weapon at all.

    \subsection{Improvised Weapons}\label{Improvised Weapons} Sometimes objects not crafted to be weapons nonetheless see use in combat. Because such objects are not designed for this use, any creature that uses one in combat is considered to be nonproficient with it.

        To determine the size category and appropriate damage for an improvised weapon, compare its relative size and damage potential to the weapon list to find a reasonable match. An improvised weapon will generally deal damage as if it were one size category smaller than a similar manufactured weapon. An improvised thrown weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.

    \subsection{Drawing and Sheathing Weapons}\label{Drawing and Sheathing Weapons}
        Sheathing any weapon is a move action.
        The time it takes to draw a weapon depends on how encumbering the weapon is.
        You can draw a \glossterm{light weapon} as a \glossterm{free action} once per round.
        You can draw any non-hidden weapon as a \glossterm{move action}.
        You can draw a hidden weapon as a \glossterm{standard action}.

    \subsection{Natural Weapons}\label{Natural Weapons}
        Every creature can attack with its body using an unarmed strike. Many monsters can attack more effectively with specific parts of their body, such as teeth and claws. These are called natural weapons. You are automatically proficient with any natural weapons you possess. Most humanoids possess no natural weapons. Natural weapons are described on \tref{Natural Weapons}.

        A creature with multiple natural weapons of the same type can designate one as a primary attack and one as a secondary attack, allowing it to fight with both at once (see \pcref{Two-Weapon Strikes}). You are only considered to have one unarmed strike, so you cannot dual wield with only your unarmed strike (but see the unarmed warrior monk ability, \pref{Mnk:Unarmed Warrior}).

    \subsection{Weapon Qualities}
        Here is the format for weapon entries (given as column headings on \trefnp{Weapons}, below).

        \parhead{Encumbrance} Describes whether the weapon is a light, medium, heavy, double, or ranged weapon.

        \par This cost is the same for a Small or Medium version of the weapon. A Large version costs twice the listed price.
        \parhead{Damage} The Damage column gives the damage dealt by the weapon on a successful hit.
        These values are accurate for creatures using weapons sized appropriately for them.
        For details about using weapons of other sizes, see \pcref{Inappropriately Sized Weapons}.

        If two damage ranges are given, the weapon is a double weapon. Use the second damage figure given for the double weapon's other side.

        \parhead{Range Increment} The range increment of the weapon.

        \parhead{Type} Weapons are classified according to the type of damage they deal: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. Some monsters may be resistant or immune to attacks from certain types of weapons.

        Some weapons deal damage of multiple types. If a weapon is of two types, the damage it deals is not half one type and half another; all of it is both types. Therefore, a creature would have to be immune to both types of damage to ignore any of the damage from such a weapon.

        In other cases, a weapon can deal either of two types of damage. In a situation when the damage type is significant, the wielder can choose which type of damage to deal with such a weapon.
        \parhead{Cost} This value is the weapon's cost in gold pieces (gp) or silver pieces (sp). The cost includes miscellaneous gear that goes with the weapon.
        \parhead{Weight} This column gives the weight of a Medium version of
        the weapon. Halve this number for Small weapons, and double it for Large weapons.

        \parhead{Special} Some weapons have special properties. See the weapon
        descriptions for details.

    \subsection{Weapon Tags}\label{Weapon Tags}
        Some weapons found on \trefnp{Weapons} have tags that indicate that they have special abilities. The list of abilities that weapons can have is given below.
        \parhead{Ammunition} This weapon is designed to thrown or fired by a projectile weapon in large quantities. It is cheaper to buy and craft, but ammunition is usually \glossterm{broken} after being fired.
        % Timing is weird
        \parhead{Bracing} As a \glossterm{move action}, you can brace this weapon against a charge until the end of the round.
        While you are bracing your weapon, you gain a \plus2d bonus to damage on attacks with that weapon against creatures that use the \textit{charge} ability to move up to you that round.
        \parhead{Compact} This weapon is unusually small. It is one size category smaller than normal for a light weapon (that is, three size categories smaller than the creature it is intended for). This makes it easier to conceal (see \pcref{Sleight of Hand}).
        \parhead{Disarming} You gain a \plus2 bonus to accuracy when you use the \textit{disarm} ability to attack with this weapon.
        \parhead{Double} This weapon has more than one striking surface. You can fight with both ends simultaneously, just like wielding two weapons at once (see \pcref{Two-Weapon Strikes}). Alternately, you can attack with one end at a time. If you have the ability to use a double weapon in one hand, you can only fight with one end at a time, not both.
        \parhead{Finesse} You can apply your Dexterity instead of your Perception when determining your accuracy with physical attacks using the weapon, even if it isn't a light weapon for you.
        This property has no effect if the weapon is not sized appropriately for you.
        \parhead{Forceful} When you use the \textit{shove} ability, you can attack with this weapon instead of with a free hand (see \pcref{Shove}).
        If you do, you gain a \plus2 bonus to accuracy on the attack.
        \parhead{Grappling} You gain a \plus2 bonus to accuracy on \glossterm{melee attacks} with this weapon against creatures who are \glossterm{grappled} by you.
        \parhead{Mounted}\label{Mounted Weapon} If you are mounted, and mount moves in the same phase that you make a \glossterm{strike} with a Mounted weapon, you gain a \plus1d bonus to damage with the strike.
        You take a \minus1d penalty to damage with Mounted weapons while not mounted.
        \parhead{Projectile} This weapon fires projectiles at range. Projectile weapons have a \glossterm{range increment} listed in their description, which indicates the distance they can be easily fired. Projectile weapons must be reloaded. The time required to reload a projectile weapon is given in the weapon description.
        Unless otherwise noted, projectile weapons cannot be used while \prone.
        \parhead{Reach}\label{Reach Weapon} This weapon can be used to attack at double your natural reach (so 10 feet for a typical Small or Medium creature). However, it cannot attack a creature within your natural reach.

        Reach weapons can held using a different grip to strike nearby foes. This is called ``short hafting''. While short hafting a Reach weapon, you ignore the weapon's Reach property, but you take a \minus2 penalty to accuracy with it.
        \parhead{Subdual} This weapon deals \glossterm{subdual damage} (see \pcref{Subdual Damage}).
        \parhead{Throwing} This weapon is designed to be thrown. Throwing weapons have a range increment listed in their description, which indicates the distance they can be easily thrown. See \pcref{Thrown Weapons}.
        \parhead{Tripping} When you use the \textit{trip} ability, you can attack with this weapon instead of with a free hand (see \pcref{Trip}).
        If you do, you gain a \plus2 bonus to accuracy on the attack.
        \parhead{Unarmed} This weapon is used as part of an unarmed strike. It cannot be disarmed. Unless you have the Unarmed Fighting feat (see \featref{Unarmed Fighting}), you can't defend yourself with this weapon, which usually makes you \defenseless.

    \subsection{Weapon Descriptions}
        Some weapons in \trefnp{Weapons} have additional abilities which are described below.
        \parhead{Claw Sheath} A claw sheath is not a weapon in itself, but a covering over a single claw that a creature can use to make claw attacks. Claw sheaths do not grant a creature without claws a claw attack. Normally, a sheath does not improve the claw attack, but magical claw sheaths can be made which grant bonuses to attacks made with the claw. It may be possible to find or craft unusual sheaths for natural weapons other than claws.
        \parhead{Crossbow, Hand} You can draw a hand crossbow back by hand. Loading a hand crossbow is a move action that requires one hand (but not the hand wielding the crossbow).
        \par You can fire a crossbow while \prone without penalty.
        \parhead{Crossbow, Heavy} You draw a heavy crossbow back by turning a small winch. Loading a heavy crossbow is a full-round action that requires both hands.
        \par You can fire a crossbow while \prone without penalty.
        \parhead{Crossbow, Light} You draw a light crossbow back by pulling a lever. Loading a light crossbow is a move action that requires both hands.
        \par You can fire a crossbow while \prone without penalty.
        \parhead{Crossbow, Repeating} The repeating crossbow (whether heavy or light) holds 10 crossbow bolts. As long as it holds bolts, you can reload it as a \glossterm{free action} by pulling the reloading lever. Loading a new case of 10 bolts is a \glossterm{standard action} that requires both hands.
        \par You can fire a crossbow while \prone without penalty.
        \parhead{Hammer, Gnome Hooked} This weapon has a hammer head which deals \plus0d damage, and a hook which deals \minus1d damage. The hook is a tripping weapon.
        \parhead{Longbow} You need both hands to fire a bow, regardless of its size. One hand is free when not firing the bow. Loading a bow is a free action that requires both hands. A longbow is too unwieldy to use while you are mounted.
        \par When attacking with a bow, you take a \minus4 penalty to accuracy against creatures that threaten you.
        \parhead{Net} A net is used to entangle enemies. When you throw a net, you make a ranged touch attack against your target. If you hit, the target is \slowed. If you control the trailing rope by succeeding on an opposed Strength check while holding it, the netted creature can move only within the limits that the rope allows.
        \par A netted creature can escape with a DR 10 Escape Artist check (normally a standard action). The net has 5 hit points and can be burst with a DR 10 Strength check as a standard action.
        \par A net is useful only against creatures within one size category of you.
        \par A net must be folded to be thrown effectively. The first time you throw your net in a fight, you make a normal ranged touch attack roll. After the net is unfolded, you take a \minus4 penalty to accuracy with it. It takes 2 full-round actions for a proficient user to fold a net and twice that long for a nonproficient one to do so.
        \parhead{Pike} A pike can be used to atttack at up to triple your natural reach (so 15 feet for a typical Small or Medium creature).
        However, it cannot be short hafted (see \pcref{Reach Weapon}).
        \parhead{Rapier} A rapier is treated as a medium weapon if it is used as a secondary weapon when making dual strikes (see \pcref{Two-Weapon Strikes}).
        \parhead{Shield, Standard} You can bash with a shield in addition to defending with it. See Armor for details.
        \parhead{Shortbow} You need both hands to fire a bow, regardless of its size. One hand is free when not firing the bow. Loading a bow is a free action that requires both hands.
        \par When attacking with a bow, you take a \minus4 penalty to accuracy against creatures that threaten you.
        \parhead{Sling} You can fire, but not load, a sling with one hand. Loading a sling is a free action that requires both hands.
        \par You can hurl ordinary stones with a sling, but stones are not as dense or as round as bullets. You take a \minus1d penalty to damage with ordinary stones.
        \parhead{Spiked Armor} Any \glossterm{body armor} can be spiked.
        You cannot normally attack with spiked armor.
        However, if your armor is spiked and you are proficient with it, you deal damage with it when you make a successful \glossterm{grapple} or \glossterm{shove} attack.
        Magical abilities on a suit of armor does not improve the spikes' effectiveness, but the spikes can be made into magic weapons in their own right.
        \parhead{Spiked Shield, Standard} You can bash with a spiked shield in addition to defending with it. See Armor for details.

        \parhead{Unarmed Strike} Anyone can attack unarmed, but it is more dangerous than attacking with a weapon. See \pcref{Unarmed Combat}, for details.

        \parhead{Whip} A whip is a light melee weapon with 15 foot reach.
        You can use a whip against foes anywhere within your reach, including adjacent foes.
        However, you can't defend yourself with a whip, which can make you \defenseless.
        % This shouldn't need to specify threatening mechanics because there are no more effects that trigger off of threatened area that a whip shouldn't be able to do.
        % and you don't \glossterm{threaten} the area into which you can make an attack.

\section{Armor}\label{Armor}

    Most characters use armor to protect themselves. There are two kinds of armor: \glossterm{body armor}, such as full plate armor, and \glossterm{shields}.

    \subsection{Armor Qualities}
        \par Here is the format for armor entries (given as column headings on \trefnp{Armor and Shields}, below).


        \parhead{Cost} The cost of the armor for Small or Medium humanoid
        creatures. See \trefnp{Armor for Unusual Creatures}, below, for armor prices for other creatures.
        \parhead{Armor/Shield Bonus} Both body armor and shields improve your Armor defense.
        Wearing multiple suits of armor or wielding multiple shields does not improve your defenses any further.

        \parhead{Dexterity} Heavy body armor limits mobility and agility, halving your Dexterity.
        If your Dexterity is negative, it is not halved.

        \subparhead{Shields} Most shields do not affect your Dexterity.
        However, a tower shield halves your Dexterity.
        This is not cumulative with the halving from wearing heavy armor.

        \parhead{Encumbrance} This value indicates how much the armor increases your \glossterm{encumbrance}.
        % TODO: awkward that this doesn't affect, say, Climb-based attacks.
        You apply your encumbrance as a penalty to all Strength and Dexterity-based checks you make.
        For details, see \pcref{Encumbrance}.

        \subparhead{Shields} If a character is wearing armor and using a shield, both armor check penalties apply.

        \parhead{Weight} This column gives the weight of the armor sized for a Medium wearer. Armor fitted for Small characters weighs half as much, and armor for Large characters weighs twice as much.

        \subsubsection{Armor Proficiency}\label{Armor Proficiency}
            You may be \glossterm{proficient} with specific types of armor: light, medium, or heavy \glossterm{body armor}, or \glossterm{shields}.
            If you wear or use armor you are not proficient with, it provides half its normal bonus to defenses.
            In addition, you apply that armor's \glossterm{encumbrance} as a penalty to your \glossterm{accuracy} with \glossterm{physical attacks}.

        \subsubsection{Moving in Armor}\label{Moving in Armor}
            The heavier the armor, the more it slows your movement.
            Light armor has no effect on your movement speed.
            Medium armor reduces your \glossterm{base speed} by five feet (to a minimum of 5 feet).
            Heavy armor reduces your \glossterm{base speed} by ten feet (to a minimum of 5 feet).

    \subsection{Getting Into And Out Of Armor}
        The time required to don armor depends on its type; see \trefnp{Donning Armor}. Donning armor of any kind takes both hands.
        \parhead{Don} This column tells how long it takes a character to put the armor on. (One minute is 10 rounds.) Readying (strapping on) a shield is only a move action.
        \parhead{Don Hastily} This column tells how long it takes to put the armor on in a hurry. The \glossterm{encumbrance} and defense bonus for hastily donned armor are each 1 point worse than normal.
        \parhead{Remove} This column tells how long it takes to get the armor off. Loosing a shield (removing it from the arm and dropping it) is only a move action.

        \begin{dtable}

            \end{dtabularx}
            1 If the character has some help, cut this time in half. A single character doing nothing else can help one or two adjacent characters. Two characters can't help each other don armor at the same time. \\
            2 The wearer must have help to don this armor. Without help, it can be donned only hastily.

    \subsection{Armor Descriptions}
        Any special benefits or accessories to the types of armor found on \trefnp{Armor and Shields} are described below.
        \parhead{Armor Spikes} You can add armor spikes to any \glossterm{body armor}.
        Spiked armor is a \glossterm{weapon} that you can deal damage with (see \pcref{Armor Weapons}).
        If your armor is spiked, you deal damage with it when you make a successful \glossterm{grapple} or \glossterm{shove} attack.
        Magical abilities on a suit of armor does not improve the spikes' effectiveness, but the spikes can be made into magic weapons in their own right.
        \parhead{Breastplate} It comes with a helmet and greaves.
        \parhead{Buckler} This small metal shield is worn strapped to your forearm.
        You can hold items in a hand holding a buckler.
        However, if you wield weapons or otherwise take actions using the arm bearing the buckler, you do not gain the buckler's defensive bonus during that time.
        \par You can't bash someone with a buckler.
        \parhead{Chain Shirt} A chain shirt comes with a steel cap.
        \parhead{Full Plate} The suit includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and a thick layer of padding that is worn underneath the armor. Each suit of full plate must be individually fitted to its owner by a master armorsmith, although a captured suit can be resized to fit a new owner with a day of work and a DR 15 Craft (metalworking) check. The new owner must still be of the same size category as the size category that the suit was designed for.
        \parhead{Gauntlet, Locked} This armored gauntlet has small chains and braces that allow the wearer to attach a weapon to the gauntlet so that it cannot be dropped easily.
        As a \glossterm{standard action}, you can lock or unlock the gauntlet with a different free hand.
        While the gauntlet is locked, any item held in that hand is extraordinarily well secured.
        This can prevent you from dropping the item if you are affected by the \textit{disarm} ability or similar effects (see \pcref{Disarm}).
        However, you are unable to use that hand for any purpose other than holding the item until you unlock the gauntlet.
        \par The price given is for a single locked gauntlet.
        If you are wearing armor that normally has gauntlets, you can replace one or both of those gauntlets with a locked gauntlet with no significant weight increase.
        Like a normal gauntlet, a locked gauntlet lets you deal normal damage rather than \glossterm{subdual damage} with unarmed attacks (see \pcref{Unarmed Combat}).
        \parhead{Half-Plate} The suit includes gauntlets.
        \parhead{Scale Mail} The suit includes gauntlets.
        \parhead{Shield, Standard, Wooden or Steel} You strap a shield to your forearm and grip it with your hand. A standard shield is so cumbersome that you can't use your shield hand for anything else.
        \subparhead{Shield Bash Attacks} You can bash an opponent with a standard shield, using it as a medium bludgeoning weapon. See \trefnp{Weapons} for the damage dealt by a shield bash.
        Magical abilities on a shield do not affect shield bash attacks made with it, but the shield can be made into a magic weapon in its own right.
        \parhead{Shield, Tower} This massive shield is nearly as tall as an average human.
        When you take the \textit{total defense} action with a tower shield, you can treat the shield as a wall along one edge of your square, providing you with \glossterm{total cover} against attacks.
        You cannot attack with a tower shield, and you cannot use your shield hand for anything else.

        While wielding a tower shield, you take a \minus2 penalty to \glossterm{accuracy} with \glossterm{strikes} because of the shield's unwieldy nature.
        \parhead{Shield Spikes} When added to your shield, these spikes turn it into a piercing weapon that increases the damage dealt by a shield bash as if the shield were designed for a creature one size category larger than you. You can't put spikes on a buckler or a tower shield. Otherwise, attacking with a spiked shield is like making a shield bash attack (see above).
        \parhead{Studded Leather} Only the studs on studded leather are made of metal.
        Studded leather armor made with studs from special materials does not grant the wearer the properties of the special material.
        For example, studded leather armor made with adamantine studs does not grant the wearer damage reduction.

    \subsection{Armor for Unusual Creatures}\label{Armor for Unusual Creatures}
        Armor and shields for unusually big creatures, unusually little creatures, and nonhumanoid creatures have different costs and weights from those given on \trefnp{Armor and Shields}. Refer to the appropriate line on the table below and apply the multipliers to cost and weight for the armor type in question.
        \begin{dtable}
            \lcaption{Armor for Unusual Creatures}

            1 Divide defense bonuses from armor by 2.
        \end{dtable}

    \subsection{Special Materials}
        Armor and shields can be made from special materials, which can alter the properties of the item. The most common special material is ironwood, which is made from wood magically treated using the \spell{ironwood} ritual to be as strong as steel. Ironwood armor functions exactly like  armor of the same type, except that it is made of wood. This causes it to weigh half the normal weight, and allows druids to wear it without penalty. However, it costs twice as much as armor of the same type would normally cost, to a minimum of an additional 200 gp.

\subsection{Adventuring Gear}
A few of the pieces of adventuring gear found on Table: Goods and Services are described below, along with any special benefits they confer on the user (``you'').
\parhead{Caltrops} A caltrop is a four-pronged iron spike crafted so that one prong faces up no matter how the caltrop comes to rest. You scatter caltrops on the ground in the hope that your enemies step on them or are at least forced to slow down to avoid them. One 2- pound bag of caltrops covers an area 5 feet square.
\par Each time a creature moves into an area covered by caltrops (or spends a round fighting while standing in such an area), it might step on one. The caltrops make an attack roll (with an accuracy of \plus0) against the creature's Armor defense. If the caltrops succeed on the attack, the creature has stepped on one. The caltrop deals 1 point of damage, and the creature's speed is reduced by one-half because its foot is wounded. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, or until the creature is successfully treated with a DR 15 Heal check, or until it receives at least 1 point of healing. Any creature moving at half speed or slower can pick its way through a bed of caltrops without stepping on any.
\par Caltrops may not be effective against unusual opponents.
\parhead{Candle} A candle dimly illuminates a 5 foot radius and burns for 1 hour.
\parhead{Chain} Chain has hardness 10 and 5 hit points. It can be burst with a DR 26 Strength check.
\parhead{Crowbar} A crowbar it grants a \plus2 bonus on Strength checks made for such purposes. If used in combat, treat a crowbar as a improvised weapon equivalent to a club.
\parhead{Flint and Steel} Lighting a torch with flint and steel is a full-round action, and lighting any other fire with them takes at least that long.
\parhead{Grappling Hook} Throwing a grappling hook successfully requires a ranged attack (DR 10, \plus2 per 10 feet of distance thrown).
\parhead{Hammer} If a hammer is used in combat, treat it as a medium improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a spiked gauntlet of its size.
\parhead{Ink} This is black ink. You can buy ink in other colors, but it costs twice as much.
\parhead{Jug, Clay} This basic ceramic jug is fitted with a stopper and holds 1 gallon of liquid.
\parhead{Lamp, Common} A lamp clearly illuminates a 20 foot radius, provides shadowy illumination out to a 40 foot radius, and burns for 6 hours on a pint of oil. You can carry a lamp in one hand.
\parhead{Lantern, Bullseye} A bullseye lantern provides bright illumination in a 50 foot cone and shadowy illumination in a 100 foot cone. It burns for 6 hours on a pint of oil. You can carry a bullseye lantern in one hand.
\parhead{Lantern, Hooded} A hooded lantern clearly illuminates a 20 foot radius and provides shadowy illumination in a 40 foot radius. It burns for 6 hours on a pint of oil. You can carry a hooded lantern in one hand.
\parhead{Lock} The DR to open a lock with the Open Lock skill depends on the lock's quality: simple (DR 20), average (DR 25), good (DR 30), or superior (DR 40).
\parhead{Manacles and Manacles, Masterwork} Manacles can bind a Medium creature. A manacled creature can use the Escape Artist skill to slip free (DR 30, or DR 35 for masterwork manacles). Breaking the manacles requires a Strength check (DR 26, or DR 28 for masterwork manacles). Manacles have hardness 10 and 10 hit points.
\par Most manacles have locks; add the cost of the lock you want to the cost of the manacles.
\par For the same cost, you can buy manacles for a Small creature.
\par For a Large creature, manacles cost ten times the indicated amount, and for a Huge creature, one hundred times this amount. Gargantuan, Colossal, Tiny, Diminutive, and Fine creatures can be held only by specially made manacles.
\parhead{Oil} A pint of oil burns for 6 hours in a lantern. You can use a flask of oil as a splash weapon. Use the rules for alchemist's fire, except that it takes a full round action to prepare a flask with a fuse. Once it is thrown, there is a 50\% chance of the flask igniting successfully.
\par You can pour a pint of oil on the ground to cover an area 5 feet square, provided that the surface is smooth. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 1d3 points of fire damage to each creature in the area.
\parhead{Ram, Portable} This iron-shod wooden beam gives you a \plus2 bonus on Strength checks made to break open a door and it allows a second person to help you without having to roll, increasing your bonus by 2.
\parhead{Rope, Hempen} This rope has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DR 23 Strength check.
\parhead{Rope, Silk} This rope has 4 hit points and can be burst with a DR 24 Strength check.
\parhead{Spyglass} Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size.
\parhead{Torch} A torch burns for 1 hour, clearly illuminating a 20 foot radius and providing shadowy illumination out to a 40 foot radius. If a torch is used in combat, treat it as a light improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a gauntlet of its size, plus 1 point of fire damage. Wielding a torch gives a \plus2 bonus to dirty trick attempts made to dazzle an opponent. Lighting a torch with an open flame or tindertwig is a standard action, while using flint and steel requires a full-round action.
\parhead{Vial} A vial holds 1 ounce of liquid. The stoppered container usually is no more than 1 inch wide and 3 inches high.

\subsection{Special Substances And Items}
Any of these substances except for the everburning torch and holy water can be made by a character with the Craft (alchemy) skill.
\parhead{Acid} You can throw a flask of acid as a splash weapon. Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a \glossterm{range increment} of 10 feet. A direct hit deals 1d6 points of acid damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the acid hits takes 1 point of acid damage from the splash.
\parhead{Alchemist's Fire} You can throw a flask of alchemist's fire as a splash weapon.
This is a ranged \glossterm{physical attack} against the target's Armor defense.
\par A direct hit deals 1d6 points of fire damage and makes the creature \ignited until the target puts out the fire.
Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of fire damage from the splash.
\parhead{Antitoxin} If you drink antitoxin, you gain a \plus5 bonus to Fortitude defense against \glossterm{Poison} abilities for 1 hour.
\parhead{Everburning Torch} This otherwise normal torch has a continual flame spell cast upon it. An everburning torch clearly illuminates a 20 foot radius and provides shadowy illumination out to a 40 foot radius.
\parhead{Holy Water} Holy water damages undead creatures and evil outsiders almost as if it were acid. A flask of holy water can be thrown as a splash weapon.
\par Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a \glossterm{range increment} of 10 feet. A flask breaks if thrown against the body of a corporeal creature, but to use it against an incorporeal creature, you must open the flask and pour the holy water out onto the target. Thus, you can douse an incorporeal creature with holy water only if you are adjacent to it. Doing so is a ranged touch attack.
\par A direct hit by a flask of holy water deals 2d4 points of damage to an undead creature or an evil outsider. Each such creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of damage from the splash.
\par Temples to good deities sell holy water at cost (making no profit).
% TODO: define fog clouds
% \parhead{Smokestick} This alchemically treated wooden stick instantly creates thick, opaque smoke when ignited. The smoke fills a 10 foot cube (treat the effect as a fog cloud spell, except that a moderate or stronger wind dissipates the smoke in 1 round). The stick is consumed after 1 round, and the smoke dissipates naturally.
\parhead{Sunrod} This 1 foot long, gold-tipped, iron rod glows brightly when struck. It clearly illuminates a 20 foot radius and provides shadowy illumination in a 40 foot radius. It glows for 6 hours, after which the gold tip is burned out and worthless.
\parhead{Tanglefoot Bag} When you throw a tanglefoot bag at a creature, make a ranged attack against the target's Reflex defense.
The bag has a \glossterm{range increment} of 10 feet.
A hit means the target is \slowed as a \glossterm{condition}.
\par In addition to being removed as a condition, this effect can be broken by dealing 5 points of damage to the goo on the target.
Unless the attacker uses a slashing weapon, damage dealt to the goo is also dealt to the creature the goo is on.
The goo's Armor defense is 0. % that doesn't make sense
In addition, when the target moves, it can make a Strength check as part of the movement.
If it beats a DR of 5, the condition is removed after the movement is complete.
\parhead{Thunderstone} You can throw this stone as a ranged attack with a \glossterm{range increment} of 20 feet.
When it strikes a hard surface (or is struck hard), it creates a deafening bang.
The creature detonating the stone makes an attack with a \plus2 \glossterm{accuracy} against the Fortitude defense of all creatures within an \areasmall radius burst from the stone.
A hit against a target means it is \deafened as a \glossterm{condition}.
\parhead{Tindertwig} The alchemical substance on the end of this small, wooden stick ignites when struck against a rough surface. Creating a flame with a tindertwig is much faster than creating a flame with flint and steel (or a magnifying glass) and tinder. Lighting a torch with a tindertwig is a standard action (rather than a full-round action), and lighting any other fire with one is at least a standard action.

\subsection{Tools and Skill Kits}
\parhead{Alchemist's Lab} An alchemist's lab always has the perfect tool for making alchemical items, so it provides a \plus2 bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks. It has no bearing on the costs related to the Craft (alchemy) skill. Without this lab, a character with the Craft (alchemy) skill is assumed to have enough tools to use the skill but not enough to get the \plus2 bonus that the lab provides.
\parhead{Artisan's Tools} These special tools include the items needed to pursue any craft. Without them, you have to use improvised tools (\minus2 penalty on Craft checks), if you can do the job at all (see \pcref{Craft}).
\parhead{Artisan's Tools, Masterwork} These tools serve the same purpose as artisan's tools (above), but masterwork artisan's tools are the perfect tools for the job, so you get a \plus2 bonus on Craft checks made with them.
\parhead{Climber's Kit} This is the perfect tool for climbing and gives you a \plus2 bonus on Climb checks.
\parhead{Disguise Kit} The kit is the perfect tool for disguise and provides a \plus2 bonus on Disguise checks. A disguise kit is exhausted after ten uses.
\parhead{Healer's Kit} It is the perfect tool for healing and provides a \plus2 bonus on Heal checks. A healer's kit is exhausted after ten uses.
\parhead{Holy Symbol, Silver or Wooden} A holy symbol focuses good energy. A cleric or paladin uses it as the focus for his spells and as a tool for turning undead. Each religion has its own holy symbol.
\parhead{Unholy Symbols} An unholy symbol is like a holy symbol except that it focuses evil energy and is used by evil clerics (or by neutral clerics who want to cast evil spells or command undead).
\parhead{Magnifying Glass} This simple lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and at least a full-round action. A magnifying glass grants a \plus2 bonus on Appraise checks
involving any item that is small or highly detailed.
\parhead{Musical Instrument, Common or Masterwork} A masterwork instrument grants a \plus2 bonus on Perform checks involving its use.
\parhead{Pitons} You can make your own handholds and footholds by pounding pitons into a wall. Doing so takes 1 minute per piton, and one piton is needed per 3 feet of distance. As with any surface that offers handholds and footholds, a wall with pitons in it has a DR of 15.
\parhead{Spell Component Pouch} A spellcaster with a spell component pouch is assumed to have all the material components and focuses needed for spellcasting, except for those components that have a specific cost, divine focuses, and focuses that wouldn't fit in a pouch.
\parhead{Spellbook, Wizard's (Blank)} A spellbook has 100 pages of parchment, and each spell takes up one page per spell level (one page each for 0-level spells).
\parhead{Thieves' Tools} This kit contains the tools you need to use the Disable Device and Open Lock skills. Without these tools, you must improvise tools, and you take a \minus2 circumstance penalty on Disable Device and Open Locks checks.
\parhead{Thieves' Tools, Masterwork} This kit contains extra tools and tools of better make, which grant a \plus2 bonus on Disable Device and Open Lock checks.
\parhead{Tool, Masterwork} This well-made item is the perfect tool for the job. It grants a \plus2 bonus on a related skill check (if any). Bonuses provided by multiple masterwork items used toward the same skill check do not stack.
\parhead{Water Clock} This large, bulky contrivance gives the time accurate to within half an hour per day since it was last set. It requires a source of water, and it must be kept still because it marks time by the regulated flow of droplets of water.

\subsection{Clothing}
\parhead{Artisan's Outfit} This outfit includes a shirt with buttons, a skirt or pants with a drawstring, shoes, and perhaps a cap or hat. It may also include a belt or a leather or cloth apron for carrying tools.
\parhead{Cleric's Vestments} These ecclesiastical clothes are for performing priestly functions, not for adventuring.
% What does this actually affect? How does cold weather work?
\parhead{Cold Weather Outfit} A cold weather outfit includes a wool coat, linen shirt, wool cap, heavy cloak, thick pants or skirt, and
boots. This outfit grants a \plus2 bonus to Fortitude defense against exposure to cold weather.
\parhead{Courtier's Outfit} This outfit includes fancy, tailored clothes in whatever fashion happens to be the current style in the courts of the nobles. If you wear this outfit without jewelry (costing an additional 50 gp), you look like an out-of-place commoner.
\parhead{Entertainer's Outfit} This set of flashy, perhaps even gaudy, clothes is for entertaining. While the outfit looks whimsical, its practical design lets you tumble, dance, walk a tightrope, or just run (if the audience turns ugly).
\parhead{Explorer's Outfit} This is a full set of clothes for someone who never knows what to expect. It includes sturdy boots, leather breeches or a skirt, a belt, a shirt (perhaps with a vest or jacket), gloves, and a cloak. Rather than a leather skirt, a leather overtunic may be worn over a cloth skirt. The clothes have plenty of pockets (especially the cloak). The outfit also includes any extra items you might need, such as a scarf or a wide-brimmed hat.
\parhead{Monk's Outfit} This simple outfit includes sandals, loose breeches, and a loose shirt, and is all bound together with sashes. The outfit is designed to give you maximum mobility, and it's made of high-quality fabric. You can hide small weapons in pockets hidden in the folds, and the sashes are strong enough to serve as short ropes.
\parhead{Noble's Outfit} This set of clothes is designed specifically to be expensive and to show it. Precious metals and gems are worked into the clothing. To fit into the noble crowd, every would-be noble also needs a signet ring (see Adventuring Gear, above) and jewelry (worth at least 100 gp).
\parhead{Peasant's Outfit} This set of clothes consists of a loose shirt and baggy breeches, or a loose shirt and skirt or overdress. Cloth wrappings are used for shoes.
\parhead{Royal Outfit} This is just the clothing, not the royal scepter, crown, ring, and other accoutrements. Royal clothes are ostentatious, with gems, gold, silk, and fur in abundance.
\parhead{Scholar's Outfit} Perfect for a scholar, this outfit includes a robe, a belt, a cap, soft shoes, and possibly a cloak.
\parhead{Traveler's Outfit} This set of clothes consists of boots, a wool skirt or breeches, a sturdy belt, a shirt (perhaps with a vest or jacket), and an ample cloak with a hood.

\subsection{Food, Drink, and Lodging}
\parhead{Inn} Poor accommodations at an inn amount to a place on the floor near the hearth. Common accommodations consist of a place on a raised, heated floor, the use of a blanket and a pillow. Good accommodations consist of a small, private room with one bed, some amenities, and a covered chamber pot in the corner.
\parhead{Meals} Poor meals might be composed of bread, baked turnips, onions, and water. Common meals might consist of bread, chicken stew, carrots, and watered-down ale or wine. Good meals might be composed of bread and pastries, beef, peas, and ale or wine.

\subsection{Mounts and Related Gear}
\parhead{Barding, Medium Creature and Large Creature} Barding is a type of armor that covers the head, neck, chest, body, and possibly legs of a horse or other mount. Barding made of medium or heavy armor provides better protection than light barding, but at the expense of speed. Barding can be made of any of the armor types found on Table: Armor and Shields.
\par Armor for a horse (a Large nonhumanoid creature) costs four times as much as armor for a human (a Medium humanoid creature) and also weighs twice as much as the armor found on Table: Armor and Shields (see \pref{Armor for Unusual Creatures}). If the barding is for a pony or other Medium mount, the cost is only double, and the weight is the same as for Medium armor worn by a humanoid. Medium or heavy barding slows a mount that wears it, as shown on the table below.

\begin{dtable}
\begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{>{\lcol}X *{3}{>{\ccol}X}}
 & \multicolumn{3}{c}{\tdash\tdash\tdash Base Speed\tdash\tdash\tdash} \\
\bottomrule
Barding & (40 ft.) & (50 ft.) & (60 ft.) \\
Medium & 30 ft. & 35 ft. & 40 ft. \\
Heavy & 30 ft.\fn{1} & 35 ft.\fn{1} & 40 ft.\fn{1} \\
\end{dtabularx}
1 A mount wearing heavy armor moves at only triple its normal speed when running instead of quadruple.	
\end{dtable}

\par Flying mounts can't fly in medium or heavy barding.
\par Removing and fitting barding takes five times as long as the figures given on Table: Donning Armor. A barded animal cannot be used to carry any load other than the rider and normal saddlebags.
\parhead{Dog, Riding} This Medium dog is specially trained to carry a Small humanoid rider. It is brave in combat like a warhorse. You take no damage when you fall from a riding dog.
\parhead{Donkey or Mule} Donkeys and mules are stolid in the face of danger, hardy, surefooted, and capable of carrying heavy loads over vast distances. Unlike a horse, a donkey or a mule is willing (though not eager) to enter dungeons and other strange or threatening places.
\parhead{Feed} Horses, donkeys, mules, and ponies can graze to sustain themselves, but providing feed for them is much better. If you have a riding dog, you have to feed it at least some meat.
\parhead{Horse} A horse (other than a pony) is suitable as a mount for a human, dwarf, elf, half-elf, or half-orc. A pony is smaller than a horse and is a suitable mount for a gnome or halfling.
\par Warhorses and warponies can be ridden easily into combat. Light horses, ponies, and heavy horses are hard to control in combat.
\parhead{Saddle, Exotic} An exotic saddle is like a normal saddle of the same sort except that it is designed for an unusual mount. Exotic saddles come in military, pack, and riding styles.
\parhead{Saddle, Military} A military saddle braces the rider, providing a \plus2 bonus on Ride checks related to staying in the saddle. If you're knocked unconscious while in a military saddle, you stay in the saddle instead of falling to the ground.
\parhead{Saddle, Pack} A pack saddle holds gear and supplies, but not a rider. It holds as much gear as the mount can carry.
\parhead{Saddle, Riding} The standard riding saddle supports a rider.

\subsection{Transport}
\parhead{Carriage} This four-wheeled vehicle can transport as many as four people within an enclosed cab, plus two drivers. In general, two horses (or other beasts of burden) draw it. A carriage comes with the harness needed to pull it.
\parhead{Cart} This two-wheeled vehicle can be drawn by a single horse (or other beast of burden). It comes with a harness.
\parhead{Galley} This three-masted ship has seventy oars on either side and requires a total crew of 200. A galley is 130 feet long and 20 feet wide, and it can carry 150 tons of cargo or 250 soldiers. For 8,000 gp more, it can be fitted with a ram and castles with firing platforms fore, aft, and amidships. This ship cannot make sea voyages and sticks to the coast. It moves about 4 miles per hour when being rowed or under sail.
\parhead{Keelboat} This 50- to 75 foot long ship is 15 to 20 feet wide and has a few oars to supplement its single mast with a square sail. It has a crew of eight to fifteen and can carry 40 to 50 tons of cargo or 100 soldiers. It can make sea voyages, as well as sail down rivers (thanks to its flat bottom). It moves about 1 mile per hour.
\parhead{Longship} This 75 foot long ship with forty oars requires a total crew of 50. It has a single mast and a square sail, and it can carry 50 tons of cargo or 120 soldiers. A longship can make sea voyages. It moves about 3 miles per hour when being rowed or under sail.
\parhead{Rowboat} This 8- to 12 foot long boat holds two or three Medium passengers. It moves about one and a half miles per hour.
\parhead{Sailing Ship} This larger, seaworthy ship is 75 to 90 feet long and 20 feet wide and has a crew of 20. It can carry 150 tons of cargo. It has square sails on its two masts and can make sea voyages. It moves about 2 miles per hour.
\parhead{Sled} This is a wagon on runners for moving through snow and over ice. In general, two horses (or other beasts of burden) draw it. A sled comes with the harness needed to pull it.
\parhead{Wagon} This is a four-wheeled, open vehicle for transporting heavy loads. In general, two horses (or other beasts of burden) draw it. A wagon comes with the harness needed to pull it.
\parhead{Warship} This 100 foot long ship has a single mast, although oars can also propel it. It has a crew of 60 to 80 rowers. This ship can carry 160 soldiers, but not for long distances, since there isn't room for supplies to support that many people. The warship cannot make sea voyages and sticks to the coast. It is not used for cargo. It moves about 2-1/2 miles per hour when being rowed or under sail.

\subsection{Spellcasting And Services}
Sometimes the best solution for a problem is to hire someone else to take care of it.
\parhead{Coach Cab} The price given is for a ride in a coach that transports people (and light cargo) between towns. For a ride in a cab that transports passengers within a city, 1 copper piece usually takes you anywhere you need to go.
\parhead{Hireling, Trained} The amount given is the typical daily wage for mercenary warriors, masons, craftsmen, scribes, teamsters, and other trained hirelings. This value represents a minimum wage; many such hirelings require significantly higher pay.
\parhead{Hireling, Untrained} The amount shown is the typical daily wage for laborers, porters, cooks, maids, and other menial workers.
\parhead{Messenger} This entry includes horse-riding messengers and runners. Those willing to carry a message to a place they were going anyway may ask for only half the indicated amount.
\parhead{Road or Gate Toll} A toll is sometimes charged to cross a well-trodden, well-kept, and well-guarded road to pay for patrols on it and for its upkeep. Occasionally, a large walled city charges a toll to enter or exit (or sometimes just to enter).
\parhead{Ship's Passage} Most ships do not specialize in passengers, but many have the capability to take a few along when transporting cargo. Double the given cost for creatures larger than Medium or creatures that are otherwise difficult to bring aboard a ship.
\parhead{Spell} The indicated amount is how much it costs to get a spellcaster to cast a spell for you. This cost assumes that you can go to the spellcaster and have the spell cast at his or her convenience. If you want to bring the spellcaster somewhere to cast a spell you need to negotiate with him or her, and the default answer is no.
\par The cost given is for a spell with no cost for a material component or focus component. If the spell includes a material component, add the cost of that component to the cost of the spell.
\par If the spell has a focus component (other than a divine focus), add 1/10 the cost of that focus to the cost of the spell.
\par Furthermore, if a spell has dangerous consequences, the spellcaster will certainly require proof that you can and will pay for dealing with any such consequences (that is, assuming that the spellcaster even agrees to cast such a spell, which isn't certain). In the case of spells that transport the caster and characters over a distance, you will likely have to pay for two castings of the spell, even if you aren't returning with the caster.
\par In addition, not every town or village has a spellcaster of sufficient level to cast any spell. In general, you must travel to a small town (or larger settlement) to be reasonably assured of finding a spellcaster capable of casting 1st-level spells, a large town for 2nd-level spells, a small city for 3rd- or 4th-level spells, a large city for 5th- or 6th-level spells, and a metropolis for 7th- or 8th-level spells. Even a metropolis isn't guaranteed to have a local spellcaster able to cast 9th-level spells. Additionally, while you may find spellcasters able to cast some spells, there is no guarantee that they are able to cast the spell you desire. In general, the more common the spell, the more likely you are to find a spellcaster able to cast it.

        \end{dtable*}

        Poisons can deal damage, weaken creatures, or even kill them.
        Some effects which are not literally poisonous, such as animal venom or fungal spores, are considered poisons.

        \subsubsection{Poison Transmission}\label{Poison Transmission}\label{Transmission}

            There are three ways that poisons can be contracted.

            \parhead{Contact} A contact poison affects any creature that touches it with bare skin.
            \parhead{Ingestion} An ingestion poison affects any creature that eats, drinks, or breathes it, depending on the type of poison.
            Ingestion poisons have no effect when used to coat weapons.
            \parhead{Injury} An injury poison affects any creature injured by something carrying the poison.
            Almost all injury poisons take liquid form, and are typically used to coat weapons.
            An attack that deals no damage cannot transmit injury poisons.

        \subsubsection{Poison Forms}\label{Poison Forms}

            There are four forms of poison.

            \parhead{Gas} Gaseous poisons are difficult to store, but easy to affect foes with.
            \parhead{Liquid} Liquid poisons are the most common type of poison.
            Liquid poisons can be used to coat weapons, slipped into food, or simply thrown at foes.
            A dose of a liquid poison is usually about one ounce of the poison.
            \parhead{Pellet} Some rare poisons come in small, solid pellets or cubes.
            Typically, these pellets contain a powerful liquid poison that becomes inert quickly after being exposed.
            Pellet poisons cannot be used to coat weapons or thrown at foes, but can be slipped into food.
            \parhead{Powder} Poison in powder form cannot be used to coat weapons, but can be slipped into food or thrown at foes.

        \subsubsection{Poison Effects}\label{Poison Effects}

            Poisons can have a wide variety of effects, as determined by the type of poison used.
            However, most poison share certain common properties.

            \parhead{Poison Attacks}\label{Potency}\label{Poison Potency}
            All poisons have a potency.
            Unless otherwise noted, a poison's accuracy is equal to its potency.
            At the end of each \glossterm{action phase}, the poison makes an attack roll against the Fortitude defense of the poisoned creature.
            Success means the creature suffers the effect of the poison, and gets closer to the poison's terminal effect (see Terminal Effects, below).
            For every 10 points by which the attack succeeds, it counts as an additional successful attack for the purpose of reaching the poison's terminal effect.
            If the attack fails, the creature does not suffect the effect of the poison that round, and gets closer to resisting the poison (see Resisting Poisons, below).
            For every 10 points by which the attack fails, it counts as an additional failed attack for the purpose of resisting the poison.

            \parhead{Resisting Poisons}
            If a poisoned creature resists a poison three times, the creature stops being poisoned by that poison.
            Unless otherwise noted, this removes any lingering effects from the poison.

            \parhead{Primary Effects}
            Most poisons have primary effects.
            If the poison successfully attacks a poisoned creature, the creature suffers the poison's primary effect as long as the creature remains poisoned.
            Repeated primary effects, such as damage per round, occur at the end of each \glossterm{action phase}.
            This includes the round in which the creature is initially affected, but not the round it stops being poisoned.

            \parhead{Terminal Effects}
            Most poisons have a terminal effect based on the type of the poison.
            If the poison successfully attacks a poisoned creature three times, the creature suffers the poison's terminal effect.
            Unless otherwise noted, the terminal effect occurs in addition to the poison's normal effect that round.
            Once a creature suffers a poison's terminal effect, it stops being poisoned.
            This does not remove any lingering effects from the poison, but prevents the creature's condition from worsening.

            \parhead{Multiple Doses}
            A creature can be affected by multiple doses of the same poison.
            This does not cause the same effect to occur multiple times, but each extra dose increases the potency of the poison by 1.

            A poison is considered the same if it has the same name and comes from the same source.
            For example, a creature bitten multiple times by the same giant spider suffers multiple doses of the same poison.
            A creature bitten multiple times by different giant spiders considers each spider's poison separately.

            \parhead{Poison Quality} Some poisons are unusually high or low quality.

        \subsubsection{Creating Poisons}\label{Creating Poisons}

            You can use the Craft (poison) skill to create poisons.
            To create a poison, you must make a Craft (poison) check against a DR equal to 10 \add the poison's potency.
            For every 2 points by which you beat this DR, the created poison's potency increases by 1.

            Creating a poison requires special materials.
            The type of materials required, and how those materials can be acquired, depend on the type of poison.

            \begin{itemize}
                \itemhead{Plant}: Plant-based poisons can typically be harvested by making a Survival check to search in appropriate terrain.
                    The DR of this check is usually equal to 10 \add the potency of the poison.
                \itemhead{Venom}: Venom requires an appropriate body part from a creature -- often, poison it naturally produces.
                \itemhead{Alchemical}: Alchemical poisons require alchemical materials.
                    These cannot normally be found in nature.
                    In unusual circumstances, these components can be synthesized from natural chemicals or magical materials with a Craft (alchemy) check equal to 10 \add the potency of the poison.
            \end{itemize}
