\section{Weapons}\label{Weapons}

    Weapons are grouped into several interlocking sets of categories. These categories pertain to what weapon group the weapon belongs to (axes, bows, and so on), the weapon's usefulness either in close combat (melee) or at a distance (ranged, which includes both thrown and projectile weapons), and its relative \glossterm{usage class} (light, medium, or heavy).

    \subsection{Weapon Mechanics}

        \subsubsection{Weapon Groups}\label{Weapon Groups}

            Weapons are organized into thematically related categories called weapon groups. They are described in \trefnp{Weapon Groups}. For example, all axes belong to the ``axes'' weapon group. Some weapons can be found in multiple weapon groups. For example, a dagger is a simple weapon, a blade, and a thrown weapon.

            \parhead{Exotic Weapons}\label{Exotic Weapons} Some weapons are rare and have unusual fighting styles.
            These weapons are called exotic weapons.
            Proficiency with a weapon group does not grant you with exotic weapons from that group.
            Some class abilities grant proficiency with exotic weapons.

            \subsubsection{Weapon Proficiency}\label{Weapon Proficiency}
                Each character is proficient with different weapon groups. These indicate the weapons that you can use effectively.
                You take a \minus2 accuracy penalty with weapons you are not proficient with.

        \subsubsection{Weapon Usage Classes}\label{Weapon Usage Classes}
            A weapon's \glossterm{usage class} is a measure of how much effort it takes to wield a weapon in combat.
            It indicates whether a melee weapon, when wielded by a creature the weapon is sized for, is considered a light weapon, a medium weapon, or a heavy weapon.

            % All weapons should have two improvements over a ``baseline'' +0/+0d weapon with no properties.
            % In addition, light and heavy weapons have additional properties that are not considered improvements.
            % Being Light grants an automatic +1a/-1d and better dual wielding/grappling, and light weapons cannot be higher than -1d base.
            % Being Medium has no special properties, but many Medium weapons have the Versatile Grip property.
            % Being Heavy grants an automatic +1d, but all heavy weapons require two hands.
            % Extreme weapons are discouraged; although this permits a Heavy weapon with +3d, no such weapon should exist.
            % Trading +1a for +1d in either direction is not considered an improvement.

            \parhead{Light Weapons}\label{Light Weapons} Light weapons are easier to use while making attacking with two weapons at once (see \pcref{Offhand Strike}) or while grappling.
            They cannot be held in two hands.
            Light weapons tend to have higher \glossterm{accuracy} than heavier weapons, but do less damage.

            \parhead{Medium Weapon} A medium weapon can normally be used in one hand.
            Most medium weapons can also be held in two hands if that is physically plausible.
            This provides no special benefit unless the weapon has the Versatile Grip tag (see \pcref{Weapon Tags}).
            Changing grips to hold it in one hand or two hands can be done as a \glossterm{free action} that requires both hands.

            \parhead{Heavy Weapon} Two hands are normally required to wield a heavy weapon.
            Heavy weapons tend to have higher damage than lighter weapons.
            If you have a Strength of 5 or higher, you can wield a heavy weapon in one hand, but you take a \minus1 penalty to \glossterm{accuracy} and a \minus1d damage penalty with the weapon while doing so.
            Changing grips to hold it in one hand or two hands can be done as a \glossterm{free action} that requires both hands.

            \parhead{Physical Size} Like all objects and creatures, weapons have a size category that represents how physically large they are. In general, light and medium weapons are one size category smaller than the wielder, while heavy weapons are the same size category as the wielder.
            All weapons are \glossterm{lightweight} unless otherwise noted.

            \parhead{Inappropriately Sized Weapons}\label{Inappropriately Sized Weapons} A weapon's \glossterm{usage class} is altered by one step for each size category of difference between the wielder's size and the size of the creature for which the weapon was designed.
            For example, a light weapon sized for a Large creature can be used by a Medium creature as if it had a medium usage class.
            The weapon's damage die gains a \plus1d bonus per size category if the weapon is unusually large, or takes a \minus1d penalty per size category if the weapon is unusually small.
            In addition, the wielder takes a \minus2 accuracy penalty with the weapon per size category of difference.
            If a weapon's usage class would be changed to something other than light, medium, or heavy by this alteration, the creature can't wield the weapon at all.

        \subsubsection{Melee Weapons}
            Melee weapons are used for making melee attacks against foes within your reach (see \pcref{Reach}). Most weapons are melee weapons.

        \subsubsection{Ranged Weapons}
            Ranged weapons are used to make attacks against distant foes within the range of your weapon. There are two kinds of ranged weapons: projectile weapons and thrown weapons.
            Ranged weapons always have two defined range limits for \glossterm{close range} and \glossterm{long range} (see \pcref{Weapon Range Limits}).

            \subsubsection{Projectile Weapons} Projectile weapons fire ammunition at a target to deal damage. The ammunition generally breaks when used.

            \subsubsection{Thrown Weapons}\label{Thrown Weapons} Thrown weapons are thrown at a target to deal damage. They generally do not break when thrown.

                \parhead{Throwing Other Weapons} It is possible to throw a weapon that is not designed to be thrown.
                The range limits are 10 feet for close range and 30 feet for long range.
                You are treated as being nonproficient with the weapon, so you take a \minus2 accuracy penalty (see \pcref{Weapon Proficiency}).
                If the attack hits, the weapon deals its normal damage.

                \parhead{Heavy Weapons} Heavy thrown weapons require a standard action to throw, rather being thrown as part of any \glossterm{strike} like normal.
                They are not always physically thrown with two hands, but they require the use of your entire body to propel the weapon, so you are not considered to have any \glossterm{free hands} while throwing a heavy thrown weapon.

            \subsubsection{Ranged Weapons in Melee}

                You take a \minus4 accuracy penalty with medium and large ranged weapons against creatures adjacent to you.

        \subsubsection{Weapon Range Limits}\label{Weapon Range Limits}
            Attack with ranged weapons become less accurate if the target is far away.
            Ranged weapons have two \glossterm{range limits} listed, with a slash between them, such as 120/480.
            The first number indicates the maximum range for a weapon's \glossterm{close range}.
            The second number indicates the maximum range for a weapon's \glossterm{long range}.
            You cannot attack a target that is beyond a weapon's long range limit.

            Attacks at close range have no penalty.
            Attacks at long range have a \minus4 accuracy penalty.
            This is called a \glossterm{longshot penalty}, and some abilities can reduce this penalty.

        \subsubsection{Improvised Weapons}\label{Improvised Weapons}
            Sometimes objects not crafted to be weapons nonetheless see use in combat.
            You can choose to be proficient with the improvised weapons weapon group, which has no specific weapons associated with it but which allows you to pick up and use non-manufactured weapons without taking a nonproficiency penalty (see \pcref{Weapon Proficiency}).

            To determine the appropriate statistics for an improvised weapon, compare its shape and composition to the weapon list to find a reasonable match.
            An improvised weapon will generally have a \minus1 accuracy penalty, a \minus1d damage penalty, or be missing at least one weapon tag relative to a similarly structured manufactured weapon.

        \subsubsection{Natural Weapons}\label{Natural Weapons}
            Natural weapons are weapons that are part of a creature's body instead of being manufactured and wielded.
            Every creature has a single unarmed strike natural weapon, though most creatures are not proficient with that weapon (see \pcref{Unarmed Combat}).
            In addition, many monsters have one or more specific natural weapons like claws.
            Creatures are automatically proficient with all natural weapons they have other than an unarmed strike.
            Natural weapons can be used to make offhand attacks just like manufactured weapons (see \pcref{Offhand Strike}).

        \subsubsection{Drawing and Sheathing Weapons}\label{Drawing and Sheathing Weapons}
            Drawing and sheathing weapons always requires the hand or hands used to hold the weapon.
            The time it takes to draw and sheathe a weapon depends on how encumbering the weapon is.
            You can draw or sheathe a \glossterm{light weapon} or \glossterm{medium weapon} as a \glossterm{free action}.
            You can draw or sheathe a \glossterm{heavy weapon} or a concealed weapon as a \glossterm{standard action}.

        \subsubsection{Weapon Tags}\label{Weapon Tags}
            Some weapons found on \trefnp{Weapons} have tags that indicate that they have special abilities. The list of abilities that weapons can have is given below.
            \parhead{Ammunition} This weapon is designed to thrown or fired by a projectile weapon in large quantities. It is cheaper to buy and craft, but ammunition is usually \glossterm{broken} after being fired.
            \parhead{Compact} This weapon is unusually small.
            It is one size category smaller than normal for a light weapon (that is, two size categories smaller than the creature it is intended for), though it is not \glossterm{lightweight} for that size.
            This makes it easier to conceal (see \pcref{Sleight of Hand}).
            In addition, you can draw or sheathe this weapon so quickly that you can also take another action in the same phase with that hand.
            For example, you can draw this weapon and attack with it in the same phase.
            \parhead{Disarming} When you use the \textit{disarm} ability with this weapon, you can knock loose objects that are held in a single hand, but not objects that are held in two hands or well secured (see \pcref{Disarm}).
            \parhead{Forceful} Whenever you deal damage to a target of your size or smaller with a strike using this weapon, you can \glossterm{knockback} the target up to 10 feet.
            \parhead{Grappling} You gain a \plus2 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} on \glossterm{melee} attacks with this weapon against creatures who are \grappled by you.
            \parhead{Impact} When you get a \glossterm{critical hit} with this weapon, you deal triple damage instead of double damage.
            \parhead{Keen} You gain a \plus3 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with \glossterm{strikes} using this weapon for the purpose of determining whether you get a \glossterm{critical hit}.
            \parhead{Long}\label{Long Weapon} This weapon can be used to attack at double your natural \glossterm{reach} (so 10 feet for a typical Medium creature).
            However, it cannot attack a creature within your natural reach.

            Long weapons can held using a different grip to strike nearby foes.
            This is called ``short hafting''.
            While short hafting a Long weapon, you ignore the weapon's Long property.
            You can change your grip as a \glossterm{free action} that requires the hand or hands used to hold the weapon.
            As normal, you cannot combine that action with other actions using the same hands, so you cannot change your grip and attack with the weapon in the same phase.
            However, you can change your grip during the \glossterm{action phase} and then attack with your new grip during the \glossterm{delayed action phase}.
            \parhead{Mounted}\label{Mounted Weapon} If you are mounted, and mount moves in the same phase that you make a \glossterm{strike} with a Mounted weapon, you gain a damage bonus with the strike equal to your \glossterm{power}.
            \parhead{Parrying} If a creature attacks you with a \glossterm{strike} while you wield this weapon, you gain a \plus2 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with strikes using this weapon against that creature during the next round.
            \parhead{Projectile} This weapon fires projectiles at range. Projectile weapons have two \glossterm{range limits} listed in their description (see \pcref{Weapon Range Limits}). Projectile weapons must be reloaded. The time required to reload a projectile weapon is given in the weapon description.
            \parhead{Stealthy}
            A stealthy weapon is smaller, quieter, or otherwise less noticeable than most weapons.
            You only take a \minus5 penalty to Stealth when trying to conceal strikes with a stealthy weapon instead of the normal \minus10 or \minus20 penalty for concealing a strike (see \pcref{Stealth}).
            \parhead{Sweeping}\label{Sweeping} When you make a \glossterm{melee} \glossterm{strike} with this weapon, you may also target one or more secondary creatures or objects within your \glossterm{reach} with that weapon.
            Each secondary target must be within 5 feet of a primary target, and must not already be a target of the strike.
            The strike affects each secondary target in the same way as the primary targets.
            Sweeping weapons have a number that indicates the number of secondary targets you can affect.
            \parhead{Subdual} This weapon deals \glossterm{subdual damage} (see \pcref{Subdual Damage}).
            \parhead{Thrown} This weapon is designed to be thrown. Thrown weapons have two \glossterm{range limits} listed in their description (see \pcref{Weapon Range Limits}). See \pcref{Thrown Weapons}.
            Unless otherwise noted in a weapon's description, a throwing weapon can be used to attack in melee without penalty.
            \parhead{Tripping} When you use the \textit{trip} ability, you can attack with this weapon instead of with a free hand (see \pcref{Trip}).
            When you successfully trip a creature with this weapon, the target takes damage as if you hit it with a strike using the weapon with a \minus3d damage penalty.
            \parhead{Unarmed} This weapon does not prevent you from using the hand it's equipped on as a free hand.
            \parhead{Versatile Grip} This weapon is designed to be held in either one hand or two hands.
            While holding this weapon in two hands, you gain a \plus1d damage bonus with the weapon.

    \subsection{Weapon Table}
        Here is the format for weapon entries (given as column headings on \trefnp{Weapons}, below).

        \parhead{Usage Class} Describes whether the weapon's \glossterm{usage class} is light, medium, or heavy (see \pcref{Weapon Usage Classes}).

        \parhead{Damage} The Damage column gives the damage dealt by the weapon on a successful hit.
        These values are accurate for creatures using weapons sized appropriately for them.
        For details about using weapons of other sizes, see \pcref{Inappropriately Sized Weapons}.

        \parhead{Range Limts} The \glossterm{range limits} of the weapon (see \pcref{Weapon Range Limits}).

        \parhead{Type} Weapons are classified according to the type of damage they deal: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.
        Some monsters may be impervious or immune to attacks from certain damage types.

        Some weapons deal damage of multiple types. If a weapon is of two types, the damage it deals is not half one type and half another; all of it is both types.
        Therefore, a creature would have to be immune to both types of damage to ignore any of the damage from such a weapon.
        For details, see \pcref{Multiple Damage Types}.

        In other cases, a weapon can deal either of two types of damage. In a situation when the damage type is significant, the wielder can choose which type of damage to deal with such a weapon.

        \parhead{Item Level (Cost)} The first value indicates the \glossterm{item level} of the item (see \pcref{Item Levels}).
        The second value in parentheses indicates the average cost to buy the item.
        Items crafted for unusually large or small creatures are more expensive.
        For each size category larger or smaller than Medium, the item's \glossterm{item level} increases by one, which increases its price.

        \parhead{Weapon Tags} Some weapons have special properties. See \pcref{Weapon Tags} for details.

    \subsection{Individual Weapon Descriptions}
        Some weapons in \trefnp{Weapons} have additional abilities which are described below.
        \parhead{Armblade} This weapon is not held in a hand.
        Instead, it is affixed to the arm of body armor with a medium or heavy \glossterm{usage class}.
        When you attack with an armblade, you cannot use the arm it is attached to for any other combat purpose in the same phase.
        You can still hold items in that hand, but they have no combat effect.
        If you are not proficient with this weapon, you increase your \glossterm{encumbrance} by 2 when wearing armor with an armblade.
        \parhead{Armor spikes} Any \glossterm{body armor} can be spiked.
        You cannot normally attack with armor spikes.
        However, if your armor is spiked and you are proficient with it, you deal damage with it when you make a successful \textit{grapple} or \textit{shove} attack.
        Your \glossterm{power} is halved for the purpose of this damage, and this damage is not doubled if you get a critical hit with the grapple or shove attack.
        If you would already deal damage with that ability from another source, such as with the \textit{wall slam} ability from the Savage feat, you instead gain a \plus1d bonus to that damage, and that damage becomes piercing damage in addition to its other types.
        Magical abilities on a suit of armor does not improve the spikes' effectiveness, but the spikes can be made into magic weapons in their own right.
        \parhead{Boot Dagger} A boot dagger is a modified boot or boot sole which contains a hidden dagger.
        The dagger is normally concealed, and requires an Awareness check with a \glossterm{difficulty rating} of 15 to find.
        Attacking with a boot dagger does not require a \glossterm{free hand}, but you must make an Agility check with a \glossterm{difficulty rating} of 10 during each phase that you attack with it.
        If you fail this check, you fall \prone after the attack.

        After you attack with a boot dagger, the dagger remains plainly visible.
        Concealing the dagger again requires a standard action.
        \parhead{Claw Sheath} A claw sheath is not a weapon in itself, but a covering over a single claw that a creature can use to make claw attacks. Claw sheaths do not grant a creature without claws a claw attack. Normally, a sheath does not improve the claw attack, but magical claw sheaths can be made which grant bonuses to attacks made with the claw. It may be possible to find or craft unusual sheaths for natural weapons other than claws.
        \parhead{Constrict} This \glossterm{natural weapon} can only be used against a foe you are grappling with (see \pcref{Grappling}).
        \parhead{Crossbow, Hand} You can draw a hand crossbow back by hand. Loading a hand crossbow is a \glossterm{free action} that requires one \glossterm{free hand} while holding the crossbow in another hand.
        \par You can fire a crossbow while \prone without penalty.
        \parhead{Crossbow, Heavy} You draw a heavy crossbow back by turning a small winch. Loading a heavy crossbow is a standard action that requires one \glossterm{free hand} while holding the crossbow in another hand.
        \par You can fire a crossbow while \prone without penalty.
        \parhead{Crossbow, Light} You draw a light crossbow back by pulling a lever. Loading a light crossbow is a \glossterm{free action} that requires one \glossterm{free hand} while holding the crossbow in another hand.
        \par You can fire a crossbow while \prone without penalty.
        \parhead{Crossbow, Repeating} The repeating crossbow (whether heavy or light) holds 5 crossbow bolts. As long as it holds bolts, you can reload it as a \glossterm{free action} by pulling the reloading lever with one \glossterm{free hand}. Loading a new case of 5 bolts is a \glossterm{standard action} that requires one \glossterm{free hand} while holding the crossbow in another hand.
        \par You can fire a crossbow while \prone without penalty.
        \parhead{Flatbow} You need both hands to fire a bow, regardless of its size. One hand is free when not firing the bow. Loading a bow is a free action that requires one \glossterm{free hand} while holding the flatbow in another hand. A flatbow is too unwieldy to use while you are mounted.
        Unlike a longbow, a flatbow is flat when not under tension and has approximately rectangular limbs.
        This spreads stress more evenly over the bow's structure, allowing more precise shots, though the firing technique is different and less commonly known.
        \parhead{Fire Arrows} These arrows are treated with alchemist's fire so they can be ignited before being shot.
        The process requires thickening the arrow shaft, reducing the precision of the arrow.
        It takes a \glossterm{move action} to ignite a fire arrow assuming you have access to an active flame the size of a torch or larger.
        In addition, fire arrows lose their flame quickly.
        If you shoot a fire arrow at a target at \glossterm{long range}, the fire goes out, and the damage dealt by the hit is not fire damage.
        \parhead{Hammer, Gnome Hooked} This weapon has a hammer head which deals 1d8 damage, and a hook which deals \minus1d damage. The hook is a tripping weapon.
        \parhead{Longbow} You need both hands to fire a bow, regardless of its size. One hand is free when not firing the bow. Loading a bow is a free action that requires one \glossterm{free hand} while holding the bow in the other hand. A longbow is too unwieldy to use while you are mounted.
        \parhead{Net} A net is used to entangle enemies. When you throw a net, you make an attack vs. Reflex against your target. If you hit, the target is \slowed. If you control the trailing rope by succeeding on an opposed Strength check while holding it, the netted creature can move only within the limits that the rope allows.
        \par A netted creature can escape with a \glossterm{difficulty rating} 10 Flexibility check (normally a standard action). The net has (2/10) and can be burst with a \glossterm{difficulty rating} 10 Strength check as a standard action.
        \par A net is useful only against creatures within one size category of you.
        \par A net must be folded to be thrown effectively. The first time you throw your net in a fight, you make a normal ranged touch attack roll. After the net is unfolded, you take a \minus4 accuracy penalty with it. It takes 2 standard actions for a proficient user to fold a net and twice that many for a nonproficient one to do so.
        \parhead{Pike} A pike's reach starts 5 feet away from your body, even when it is short hafted.
        This allows it to reach foes 15 feet away from you while you are not short hafting it, but makes it impossible to attack an adjacent foe regardless of your grip.
        \parhead{Shield, Standard} You can bash with a shield in addition to defending with it. See Armor for details.
        \parhead{Shortbow} You need both hands to fire a bow, regardless of its size. One hand is free when not firing the bow. Loading a bow is a free action that requires one \glossterm{free hand} while holding the shortbow in another hand.
        \parhead{Sling} You can fire, but not load, a sling with one hand. Loading a sling is a free action that requires both hands.
        \par You can hurl ordinary stones with a sling, but stones are not as dense or as round as bullets. You take a \minus1d damage penalty with ordinary stones.
        \parhead{Spear} You cannot throw a spear while holding it in two hands.
        \parhead{Spiked Knee} This weapon is not held in a hand.
        Instead, it is affixed to the leg of body armor with a medium or heavy \glossterm{usage class}.
        If you are not proficient with this weapon, you increase your \glossterm{encumbrance} by 2 when wearing armor with a spiked knee.
        \parhead{Spiked Shield, Standard} You can bash with a spiked shield in addition to defending with it. See Armor for details.
        \parhead{Takedown Bow} A takedown bow is a bow assembled from multiple independent components that can be reconfigured into two different combinations.
        In its longbow configuration, it has a heavy usage class and \glossterm{range limits} of 180/720.
        In its shortbow configuration, it has a medium usage class and \glossterm{range limits} of 120/480.
        In addition, when it is fully disassembled, it takes up space equivalent to a light usage class weapon, making it easier to transport and conceal.
        \parhead{Unarmed Strike} Anyone can use an unarmed strike to attack.
        However, unless you are proficient with the Unarmed Weapons weapon group, you suffer the normal penalties for attacking with a weapon you are not proficient with (see \pcref{Weapon Proficiency}).

        \parhead{Whip} A whip is a light melee weapon with 15 foot reach.
        You can use a whip against foes anywhere within your reach, including adjacent foes.

\section{Armor}\label{Armor}

    Most characters use armor to protect themselves. There are two kinds of armor: \glossterm{body armor}, such as full plate armor, and \glossterm{shields}.
    Body armor is worn on your body.
    You can only benefit from one body armor at a time.
    If you somehow wear multiple layers of body armor, the penalties stack and the benefits do not stack.
    A shield requires a free hand instead of being worn on the body.

    \subsection{Armor Mechanics}

        \subsubsection{Armor Usage Classes}\label{Armor Usage Classes}
            An armor's \glossterm{usage class} is a measure of how the armor is used, and how much effort is required to use it.
            It indicates whether armor, when used by a creature the armor is sized for, is considered light armor, medium armor, or heavy armor.

        \subsubsection{Armor Proficiency}\label{Armor Proficiency}
            Proficiency with armor is defined by the armor's usage class.
            If you wear or use armor you are not proficient with, it provides half its normal defense bonus.
            In addition, you apply that armor's \glossterm{encumbrance} as a penalty to your \glossterm{accuracy}.
            Since standard shields have no \glossterm{encumbrance}, you can use them without penalizing your attacks.

        \subsubsection{Getting Into And Out Of Armor}
            The time required to don armor depends on its type; see \trefnp{Donning Armor}. Donning and removing body armor and shields takes both hands.
            \parhead{Don} This column tells how long it takes a character to put the armor on. (One minute is 10 rounds.) Readying (strapping on) a shield is a \glossterm{free action}.
            \parhead{Don Hastily} This column tells how long it takes to put the armor on in a hurry. The \glossterm{encumbrance} and defense bonus for hastily donned armor are each 1 point worse than normal.
            \parhead{Remove} This column tells how long it takes to get the armor off.

                1 If the character has some help, cut this time in half. A single character doing nothing else can help one or two adjacent characters. Two characters can't help each other don armor at the same time. \\
                2 The wearer must have help to don this armor. Without help, it can be donned only hastily.
            \end{dtable}

    \subsection{Armor Table}
        \par Here is the format for armor entries (given as column headings on \trefnp{Armor and Shields}, below).

        \parhead{Defense} This value indicates how much the armor increases your Armor defense.

        \parhead{Physical Resist} This value indicates how much the armor increases your \glossterm{resistance} against \glossterm{physical damage} (see \pcref{Resistances}).

        \parhead{Energy Resist} This value indicates how much the armor increases your \glossterm{resistance} against \glossterm{energy damage} (see \pcref{Resistances}).

        \parhead{Encumbrance} This value indicates how much the armor increases your \glossterm{encumbrance}.
        You apply your encumbrance as a penalty to all Strength and Dexterity-based checks and skills.
        For details, see \pcref{Encumbrance}.

        \parhead{Speed} Some armor decreases your \glossterm{base speed} by the given value while it is used.

        \parhead{Dex} Some armor halves your current and base Dexterity while being used.
        If your Dexterity or base Dexterity are negative, they are not halved.

        \parhead{Item Level (Cost)} The first value indicates the \glossterm{item level} of the item (see \pcref{Item Levels}).
        The second value in parentheses indicates the average cost to buy the item.
        Items crafted for unusually large or small creatures are more expensive.
        For each size category larger or smaller than Medium, the item's \glossterm{item level} increases by one, which increases its price.

        \parhead{Armor/Shield Bonus} Both body armor and shields improve your Armor defense.
        Wearing multiple suits of armor or wielding multiple shields does not improve your defenses any further.

        \parhead{Weight and Size} The size category of body armor is the same as the size category of the creature it is sized for.
        Bucklers and standard shields are one size category smaller than the creature they are sized for, while tower shields are the same size category as the creature they are sized for.
        All armor and shields except for heavy body armor are \glossterm{lightweight} objects.

    \subsection{Individual Armor Descriptions}
        Any special benefits or accessories to the types of armor found on \trefnp{Armor and Shields} are described below.
        \parhead{Armor Spikes} You can add armor spikes to any \glossterm{body armor}.
        Armor spikes are a \glossterm{weapon} that you can deal damage with (see \pcref{Armor Weapons}).
        Magical abilities on a suit of armor does not improve the spikes' effectiveness, but the spikes can be made into magic weapons in their own right.
        \parhead{Breastplate} It comes with a helmet and greaves.
        \parhead{Buckler} This small metal shield is worn strapped to your forearm.
        You can treat the hand using a buckler as a \glossterm{free hand}.
        However, if you wield weapons or otherwise take actions using the arm bearing the buckler, you do not gain the buckler's defensive bonus during that phase.
        \par You can't bash someone with a buckler.
        \parhead{Chain Shirt} A chain shirt comes with a steel cap.
        \parhead{Full Plate} The suit includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and a thick layer of padding that is worn underneath the armor. Each suit of full plate must be individually fitted to its owner by a master armorsmith, although a captured suit can be resized to fit a new owner with a day of work and a \glossterm{difficulty rating} 10 Craft (metalworking) check. The new owner must still be of the same size category as the size category that the suit was designed for.
        \parhead{Gauntlet, Locked} This armored gauntlet has small chains and braces that allow the wearer to attach a weapon to the gauntlet so that it cannot be dropped easily.
        As a \glossterm{standard action}, you can lock or unlock the gauntlet with a different free hand.
        While the gauntlet is locked, any item held in that hand is extraordinarily well secured.
        This can prevent you from dropping the item if you are affected by the \textit{disarm} ability or similar effects (see \pcref{Disarm}).
        However, you are unable to use that hand for any purpose other than holding the item until you unlock the gauntlet.
        \par The price given is for a single locked gauntlet.
        If you are wearing armor that normally has gauntlets, you can replace one or both of those gauntlets with a locked gauntlet with no significant weight increase.
        Like a normal gauntlet, a locked gauntlet lets you deal normal damage rather than \glossterm{subdual damage} with unarmed attacks (see \pcref{Unarmed Combat}).
        \parhead{Half-Plate} The suit includes gauntlets.
        \parhead{Scale Mail} The suit includes gauntlets.
        \parhead{Shield, Standard, Wooden or Steel} You strap a shield to your forearm and grip it with your hand. A standard shield is so cumbersome that you can't use your shield hand for anything else.
        \subparhead{Shield Bash Attacks} You can bash an opponent with a standard shield, using it as a medium bludgeoning weapon. See \trefnp{Weapons} for the damage dealt by a shield bash.
        Magical abilities on a shield do not affect shield bash attacks made with it, but the shield can be made into a magic weapon in its own right.
        \parhead{Shield, Tower} This massive shield is nearly as tall as an average human.
        When you take the \textit{total defense} action with a tower shield, you gain a \plus4 bonus to Armor defense in addition to the normal bonuses from taking that action (see \pcref{Total Defense}).
        You cannot attack with a tower shield, and you cannot use your shield hand for anything else.

        While wielding a tower shield, you take a \minus1 penalty to \glossterm{accuracy} with \glossterm{strikes} because of the shield's unwieldy nature.
        \parhead{Shield Spikes} When added to your shield, these spikes turn it into a piercing weapon that increases the damage dealt by a shield bash by \plus1d. You can't put spikes on a buckler or a tower shield. Otherwise, attacking with a spiked shield is like making a shield bash attack (see above).
        \parhead{Studded Leather} Only the studs on studded leather are made of metal.
        Studded leather armor made with studs from special materials does not grant the wearer the properties of the special material.

    \subsection{Special Materials}\label{Special Materials}
        Body armor can be made from special materials that can alter the properties of the item.
        These special materials are described in \trefnp{Armor Special Materials}.

    \subsection{Adventuring Gear}
        A few of the pieces of adventuring gear found on \trefnp{Goods and Services} are described below, along with any special benefits they confer on the user (``you'').
        \parhead{Caltrops} A caltrop is a four-pronged iron spike crafted so that one prong faces up no matter how the caltrop comes to rest. You scatter caltrops on the ground in the hope that your enemies step on them or are at least forced to slow down to avoid them. One 2- pound bag of caltrops covers an area 5 feet square.
        \par Whenever a creature moves into the area, unless the creature moves at one quarter speed to avoid the danger, the caltrops make an attack vs. the creature's Armor defense.
        Unlike most attacks, this attack can happen during the \glossterm{movement phase}.
        The accuracy of the caltrops is \plus0.
        On a hit, the caltrops deal 1d6 piercing damage.
        \par Caltrops may not be effective against creatures with an unusual anatomy.
        Multiple applications of caltrops in the same area have no additional effect.
        \parhead{Candle} A candle dimly illuminates a 5 foot radius and burns for 1 hour.
        % \parhead{Chain} Chain has \glossterm{damage resistance} of 10 and a \glossterm{vital resistance} of 20. It can be burst with a \glossterm{difficulty rating} 18 Strength check.
        \parhead{Crowbar} A crowbar it grants a \plus2 bonus on Strength checks made for such purposes. If used in combat, treat a crowbar as an improvised weapon equivalent to a club.
        \parhead{Flint and Steel} Lighting a torch with flint and steel is a standard action.
        Lighting any other fire may take additional standard actions, depending on the size of the fire.
        \parhead{Grappling Hook} Throwing a grappling hook successfully requires a ranged attack (\glossterm{difficulty rating} 10, \plus2 per 10 feet of distance thrown).
        \parhead{Hammer} If a hammer is used in combat, treat it as a medium improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a spiked gauntlet of its size.
        \parhead{Ink} This is black ink. You can buy ink in other colors, but it costs twice as much.
        \parhead{Jug, Clay} This basic ceramic jug is fitted with a stopper and holds 1 gallon of liquid.
        \parhead{Lamp, Common} A lamp provides bright illumination in a 15 foot radius, provides shadowy illumination out to a 30 foot radius, and burns for 6 hours on a pint of oil. You can carry a lamp in one hand.
        \parhead{Lantern, Bullseye} A bullseye lantern provides bright illumination in a 30 foot cone and shadowy illumination in a 60 foot cone. It burns for 6 hours on a pint of oil. You can carry a bullseye lantern in one hand.
        \parhead{Lantern, Hooded} A hooded lantern clearly illuminates a 15 foot radius and provides shadowy illumination in a 30 foot radius. It burns for 6 hours on a pint of oil. You can carry a hooded lantern in one hand.
        \parhead{Lock} The \glossterm{difficulty rating} to open a lock with the Open Lock skill depends on the lock's quality: simple (\glossterm{difficulty rating} 20), average (\glossterm{difficulty rating} 25), good (\glossterm{difficulty rating} 30), or superior (\glossterm{difficulty rating} 40).
        \parhead{Manacles and Manacles, Masterwork} Manacles can bind a Medium creature. A manacled creature can use the Flexibility skill to slip free (\glossterm{difficulty rating} 20, or \glossterm{difficulty rating} 30 for masterwork manacles). Breaking the manacles requires a Strength check against the same difficulty rating.
        %TODO: manacle hit points / resistances
        \par Most manacles have locks; add the cost of the lock you want to the cost of the manacles.
        \par For the same cost, you can buy manacles for a Small creature.
        \par For a Large creature, manacles cost ten times the indicated amount, and for a Huge creature, one hundred times this amount. Creatures of any other size can be held only by specially made manacles.
        \parhead{Oil} A pint of oil burns for 6 hours in a lantern. You can use a flask of oil as a splash weapon. Use the rules for alchemist's fire, except that it takes a standard action to prepare a flask with a fuse. Once it is thrown, there is a 50\% chance of the flask igniting successfully.
        \par You can pour a pint of oil on the ground to cover an area 5 feet square, provided that the surface is smooth. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 1d3 points of fire damage to each creature in the area.
        \parhead{Ram, Portable} This iron-shod wooden beam gives you a \plus2 bonus on Strength checks made to break open a door and it allows a second person to help you without having to roll, increasing your bonus by 2.
        \parhead{Rope, Hempen} This rope has 4 \glossterm{hit points} and can be burst with a \glossterm{difficulty rating} 13 Strength check.
        \parhead{Rope, Silk} This rope has 5 \glossterm{hit points} and can be burst with a \glossterm{difficulty rating} 14 Strength check.
        \parhead{Spyglass} Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size.
        \parhead{Torch} A torch burns for 1 hour, clearly illuminating a 15 foot radius and providing shadowy illumination out to a 30 foot radius. If a torch is used in combat, treat it as a light improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a gauntlet of its size, plus 1 point of fire damage. Wielding a torch gives a \plus2 bonus to dirty trick attempts made to dazzle an opponent.
        \parhead{Vial} A vial holds 1 ounce of liquid. The stoppered container usually is no more than 1 inch wide and 3 inches high.

    \subsection{Tools and Skill Kits}
        \parhead{Alchemist's Lab} An alchemist's lab always has the perfect tool for making alchemical items, so it provides a \plus2 bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks. It has no bearing on the costs related to the Craft (alchemy) skill. Without this lab, a character with the Craft (alchemy) skill is assumed to have enough tools to use the skill but not enough to get the \plus2 bonus that the lab provides.
        \parhead{Artisan's Tools} These tools allow the creation of items with a particular Craft skill (see \pcref{Craft}).
        Many types of artisan's tools exist, each for different Craft skills.
        \parhead{Disguise Kit} This kit allows the use of the Disguise skill to disguise creatures (see \pcref{Disguise}).
        \parhead{Holy Symbol, Silver or Wooden} Each religion has its own holy symbol. A small number of creatures respond in particular ways to holy symbols.
        \parhead{Magnifying Glass} This simple lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires in sunlight. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and at least a standard action.
        \parhead{Pitons} You can make your own handholds and footholds by pounding pitons into a wall. Doing so takes 1 minute per piton, and one piton is needed per 3 feet of distance. As with any surface that offers handholds and footholds, a wall with pitons in it has a \glossterm{difficulty rating} of 15.
        \parhead{Thieves' Tools} These tools allow the use of the Devices skill to manipulate devices (see \pcref{Devices}).
        \parhead{Water Clock} This large, bulky contrivance gives the time accurate to within half an hour per day since it was last set. It requires a source of water, and it must be kept still because it marks time by the regulated flow of droplets of water.

    \subsection{Clothing}
        \parhead{Artisan's Outfit} This outfit includes a shirt with buttons, a skirt or pants with a drawstring, shoes, and perhaps a cap or hat. It may also include a belt or a leather or cloth apron for carrying tools.
        \parhead{Cleric's Vestments} These ecclesiastical clothes are for performing priestly functions, not for adventuring.
        % What does this actually affect? How does cold weather work?
        \parhead{Cold Weather Outfit} A cold weather outfit includes a wool coat, linen shirt, wool cap, heavy cloak, thick pants or skirt, and
        boots. This outfit grants a \plus2 bonus to Fortitude defense against exposure to cold weather.
        \parhead{Courtier's Outfit} This outfit includes fancy, tailored clothes in whatever fashion happens to be the current style in the courts of the nobles. If you wear this outfit without jewelry (costing an additional 50 gp), you look like an out-of-place commoner.
        \parhead{Entertainer's Outfit} This set of flashy, perhaps even gaudy, clothes is for entertaining. While the outfit looks whimsical, its practical design lets you tumble, dance, walk a tightrope, or just run (if the audience turns ugly).
        \parhead{Explorer's Outfit} This is a full set of clothes for someone who never knows what to expect. It includes sturdy boots, leather breeches or a skirt, a belt, a shirt (perhaps with a vest or jacket), gloves, and a cloak. Rather than a leather skirt, a leather overtunic may be worn over a cloth skirt. The clothes have plenty of pockets (especially the cloak). The outfit also includes any extra items you might need, such as a scarf or a wide-brimmed hat.
        \parhead{Monk's Outfit} This simple outfit includes sandals, loose breeches, and a loose shirt, and is all bound together with sashes. The outfit is designed to give you maximum mobility, and it's made of high-quality fabric. You can hide small weapons in pockets hidden in the folds, and the sashes are strong enough to serve as short ropes.
        \parhead{Noble's Outfit} This set of clothes is designed specifically to be expensive and to show it. Precious metals and gems are worked into the clothing. To fit into the noble crowd, every would-be noble also needs a signet ring (see Adventuring Gear, above) and jewelry (worth at least 100 gp).
        \parhead{Peasant's Outfit} This set of clothes consists of a loose shirt and baggy breeches, or a loose shirt and skirt or overdress. Cloth wrappings are used for shoes.
        \parhead{Royal Outfit} This is just the clothing, not the royal scepter, crown, ring, and other accoutrements. Royal clothes are ostentatious, with gems, gold, silk, and fur in abundance.
        \parhead{Scholar's Outfit} Perfect for a scholar, this outfit includes a robe, a belt, a cap, soft shoes, and possibly a cloak.
        \parhead{Traveler's Outfit} This set of clothes consists of boots, a wool skirt or breeches, a sturdy belt, a shirt (perhaps with a vest or jacket), and an ample cloak with a hood.

    \subsection{Food, Drink, and Lodging}
        \parhead{Inn} Poor accommodations at an inn amount to a place on the floor near the hearth. Common accommodations consist of a place on a raised, heated floor, the use of a blanket and a pillow. Good accommodations consist of a small, private room with one bed, some amenities, and a covered chamber pot in the corner.
        \parhead{Meals} Poor meals might be composed of bread, baked turnips, onions, and water. Common meals might consist of bread, chicken stew, carrots, and watered-down ale or wine. Good meals might be composed of bread and pastries, beef, peas, and ale or wine.

    \subsection{Mounts and Related Gear}
        \parhead{Barding, Medium Creature and Large Creature} Barding is a type of armor that covers the head, neck, chest, body, and possibly legs of a horse or other mount. Barding made of medium or heavy armor provides better protection than light barding, but at the expense of speed. Barding can be made of any of the armor types found on \tref{Armor and Shields}.
        \par Armor for a horse (a Large nonhumanoid creature) costs four times as much as armor for a human (a Medium humanoid creature) and also weighs twice as much as the armor found on \tref{Armor and Shields}. If the barding is for a pony or other Medium mount, the cost is only double, and the weight is the same as for Medium armor worn by a humanoid. Medium or heavy barding slows a mount that wears it, as shown on the table below.

        \par Flying creatures can't fly in barding that gives them any \glossterm{encumbrance} (see \pcref{Flying Mechanics}).
        \par Removing and fitting barding takes five times as long as the figures given on \tref{Donning Armor}. A barded animal cannot be used to carry any load other than the rider and normal saddlebags.
        \parhead{Dog, Riding} This Medium dog is specially trained to carry short-statured humanoid riders like halflings and gnomes. It is brave in combat like a warhorse. You take no damage when you fall from a riding dog.
        \parhead{Donkey or Mule} Donkeys and mules are stolid in the face of danger, hardy, surefooted, and capable of carrying heavy loads over vast distances. Unlike a horse, a donkey or a mule is willing (though not eager) to enter dungeons and other strange or threatening places.
        \parhead{Feed} Horses, donkeys, mules, and ponies can graze to sustain themselves, but providing feed for them is much better. If you have a riding dog, you have to feed it at least some meat.
        \parhead{Horse} A horse (other than a pony) is suitable as a mount for a human, dwarf, elf, half-elf, or half-orc. A pony is smaller than a horse and is a suitable mount for a gnome or halfling.
        \par Warhorses and warponies can be ridden easily into combat. Light horses, ponies, and heavy horses are hard to control in combat.
        \parhead{Saddle, Exotic} An exotic saddle is like a normal saddle of the same sort except that it is designed for an unusual mount. Exotic saddles come in military, pack, and riding styles.
        \parhead{Saddle, Military} A military saddle braces the rider, providing a \plus2 bonus on Ride checks related to staying in the saddle. If you're knocked unconscious while in a military saddle, you stay in the saddle instead of falling to the ground.
        \parhead{Saddle, Pack} A pack saddle holds gear and supplies, but not a rider. It holds as much gear as the mount can carry.
        \parhead{Saddle, Riding} The standard riding saddle supports a rider.

    \subsection{Transport}
        \parhead{Carriage} This four-wheeled vehicle can transport as many as four people within an enclosed cab, plus two drivers. In general, two horses (or other beasts of burden) draw it. A carriage comes with the harness needed to pull it.
        \parhead{Cart} This two-wheeled vehicle can be drawn by a single horse (or other beast of burden). It comes with a harness.
        \parhead{Galley} This three-masted ship has seventy oars on either side and requires a total crew of 200. A galley is 130 feet long and 20 feet wide, and it can carry 150 tons of cargo or 250 soldiers. For 8,000 gp more, it can be fitted with a ram and castles with firing platforms fore, aft, and amidships. This ship cannot make sea voyages and sticks to the coast. It moves about 4 miles per hour when being rowed or under sail.
        \parhead{Keelboat} This 50- to 75 foot long ship is 15 to 20 feet wide and has a few oars to supplement its single mast with a square sail. It has a crew of eight to fifteen and can carry 40 to 50 tons of cargo or 100 soldiers. It can make sea voyages, as well as sail down rivers (thanks to its flat bottom). It moves about 1 mile per hour.
        \parhead{Longship} This 75 foot long ship with forty oars requires a total crew of 50. It has a single mast and a square sail, and it can carry 50 tons of cargo or 120 soldiers. A longship can make sea voyages. It moves about 3 miles per hour when being rowed or under sail.
        \parhead{Rowboat} This 8- to 12 foot long boat holds two or three Medium passengers. It moves about one and a half miles per hour.
        \parhead{Sailing Ship} This larger, seaworthy ship is 75 to 90 feet long and 20 feet wide and has a crew of 20. It can carry 150 tons of cargo. It has square sails on its two masts and can make sea voyages. It moves about 2 miles per hour.
        \parhead{Sled} This is a wagon on runners for moving through snow and over ice. In general, two horses (or other beasts of burden) draw it. A sled comes with the harness needed to pull it.
        \parhead{Wagon} This is a four-wheeled, open vehicle for transporting heavy loads. In general, two horses (or other beasts of burden) draw it. A wagon comes with the harness needed to pull it.
        \parhead{Warship} This 100 foot long ship has a single mast, although oars can also propel it. It has a crew of 60 to 80 rowers. This ship can carry 160 soldiers, but not for long distances, since there isn't room for supplies to support that many people. The warship cannot make sea voyages and sticks to the coast. It is not used for cargo. It moves about 2-1/2 miles per hour when being rowed or under sail.
