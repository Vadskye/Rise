\chapter{Items and Equipment}

This chapter defines the items and equipment that exist in the universe of Rise, including both magical and nonmagical items.
Items are divided into five broad categories, described below.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Weapons are typically used to make \glossterm{strikes}.
        Weapons come in many forms, and can have very different uses in combat.
    \item Armor is worn or wielded to protect yourself.
        There are two types of armor: body armor and shields.
    \item Apparel items are worn on the body, but unlike armor they have no intrinsic defensive properties.
        Rings, cloaks, and all manner of other worn items are considered apparel.
        The only mechanically significant apparel items are \magical.
    \item Implements are typically held while casting spells or using other magical abilities.
        The only mechanically significant implements are \magical.
    \item Tools are used to achieve an effect instead of worn on the body.
        Potions, traps, and magic bags are all tools.
\end{itemize}

\section{Wealth And Item Ranks}\label{Wealth}\label{Wealth and Item Ranks}

    The worth of an item can be measured with money, or with the more abstract concept of an item's rank.
    Both measurements are closely connected.
    In general, gold pieces are a more useful concept at low levels, and item rank are more useful at high levels.
    However, both concepts function at any level, so you can use whichever makes more sense in a particular game.

    \subsection{Coins}
        The most common coin is the gold piece (gp). A gold piece is worth 10 silver pieces. Each silver piece is worth 10 copper pieces (cp). In addition to copper, silver, and gold coins, there are also platinum pieces (pp), which are each worth 10 gp.

        The standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce (fifty to the pound).

        \begin{dtable}
            \lcaption{Coin Exchange Values}
            \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{l c *{4}{>{\ccol}X}}
                                    &   & \tb{CP} & \tb{SP} & \tb{GP} & \tb{PP} \tableheaderrule
                Copper piece (cp)   & = & 1       & 1/10    & 1/100   & 1/1,000 \\
                Silver piece (sp)   & = & 10      & 1       & 1/10    & 1/100   \\
                Gold piece (gp)     & = & 100     & 10      & 1       & 1/10    \\
                Platinum piece (pp) & = & 1,000   & 100     & 10      & 1
            \end{dtabularx}
        \end{dtable}

    \subsection{Item Ranks}\label{Item Ranks}

        Each item has a rank associated with it.
        An item's rank is generally correlated with the item's effectiveness, rarity, and value.
        A magic item's \glossterm{power} is equal to the class bonus to power that a barbarian of that rank would have.
        These effects are summarized in \trefnp{Item Ranks}.

        In general, five items of a given rank are worth the same as a single item that is one rank higher.
        Likewise, one item of a given rank is worth four items that are each one rank lower.

        \parhead{Gear and Consumables}
            Long-term items that are expected to be worn or otherwise used repeatedly are more expensive than items that are destroyed immediately after being used.
            Although consumable items are cheaper, they still use their full rank for all other purposes, such as their power and how difficult they are to buy.
            In general, five consumable items of a given rank are worth as much as a single non-consumable item of that rank.

        \begin{dtable}
            \lcaption{Item Ranks}
            \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{l l X X}
                \tb{Rank} & \tb{Power} & \tb{Typical Gear Price} & \tb{Typical Consumable Price} \tableheaderrule
                0 & 2 & 10 gp or less & 2 gp or less \\
                1 & 3 & 40 gp         & 8 gp         \\
                2 & 4 & 200 gp        & 40 gp        \\
                3 & 5 & 1,000 gp      & 200 gp       \\
                4 & 7 & 5,000 gp      & 1,000 gp     \\
                5 & 10 & 25,000 gp     & 5,000 gp     \\
                6 & 14 & 125,000 gp    & 25,000 gp    \\
                7 & 20 & 625,000 gp    & 125,000 gp   \\
            \end{dtabularx}
        \end{dtable}

        Items with a rank of 0 or 1 may be found among common folk, though few commoners would have more than one magic item of any value.
        Items with a rank of 2 or higher are usually only owned or used by nobility, wealthy merchants, and adventurers.

    \subsection{Buying and Selling Items}
        Items of any rank can be exchanged for other items based on their rank.
        In general, items with an rank of 3 or less can be bought or sold in exchange for gold pieces.
        Items with an rank of 4 or higher are exceptionally rare.
        The monetary value of such items is so exorbitant that they are almost never purchased or sold with gold pieces.
        Instead, they are typically exchanged for similarly rare magic items or gems.

        Wandering adventurers typically have a limited time frame to sell their items, and it can be hard to find a buyer for highly valuable items on short notice, so they must accept lower prices than merchants can charge.
        When selling for gold pieces, you can expect to receive a fifth of the item's typical value according to its rank.
        When selling for another item, you can expect to receive an item or trade good of one rank lower in exchange.
        These ratios can be negotiated, and favorably disposed merchants or nobles may give better deals.

        \subsubsection{Trade Goods}
            Some items are considered trade goods.
            Trade goods have a widely agreed upon value, but no intrinsic use.
            Gold pieces and gems are examples of trade goods.
            Trade goods differ from other items in that even adventurers can typically receive their full value when selling them to established merchants.
            Some common trade goods are detailed in \tref{Trade Goods}.

            \begin{dtable}
                \lcaption{Trade Goods}
                \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{l >{\lcol}X}
                    \tb{Cost} & \tb{Item} \tableheaderrule
                    1 cp & One pound of wheat \\
                    2 cp & One pound of flour \\
                    1 sp & One pound of iron, or one chicken \\
                    5 sp & One pound of tobacco or copper \\
                    1 gp & One pound of cinnamon, or one goat \\
                    2 gp & One pound of ginger or pepper, or one sheep \\
                    3 gp & One pig \\
                    4 gp & One square yard of linen \\
                    5 gp & One pound of salt or silver \\
                    10 gp & One square yard of silk, or one cow \\
                    15 gp & One pound of saffron or cloves, or one ox \\
                    50 gp & One pound of gold \\
                    500 gp & One pound of platinum
                \end{dtabularx}
            \end{dtable}

    \subsection{Typical Wealth Acquisition}
        A typical character finds one non-consumable item appropriate for them per level.
        That item would have a rank equal to that character's highest rank at the time.
        For example, a typical 5th level character would have five items: two rank 2 items, and 3 rank 1 items.
        In addition, characters typically find several consumable items per level that are appropriate to their rank.

        Over time, lower rank items stop being useful, so most characters use no more than five or six different items at a time, plus various consumables.
        A typical 20th level character does not carry around 20 different items.
        However, the lower level items are essentially irrelevant from the perspective of calculating wealth, so the ``one item per level'' guideline is still useful.

        This is a drastic simplification of the sometimes messy process of accumulating wealth and magic items over the course of a typical campaign.
        Characters will often find additional items that they have no immediate use for.
        Players may go several sessions without acquiring any particular items until they complete their current quest, which may reward them with a large number of items at once.
        This is all fine, and the GM should not feel compelled to keep item acquisition perfectly on rails.
        Rise is only loosely balanced around this general pace of item acquisition, and it is not hard - or always necessary - to adjust encounters to deal with unusually wealthy or poor characters.

\section{Using Items}

    \subsection{Manipulating Ordinary Objects}
        In general, using a small object in a simple way requires a \glossterm{minor action}.
        For example, you can draw or sheathe a weapon as a minor action.
        Using complex objects, large objects, or inconveniently stored objects generally requires a \glossterm{standard action}.
        For example, drinking a potion requires a standard action.

    \subsection{Magic Item Activation}

        Some magic items have to be explicitly activated to have unusual effects.
        For example, the \mitem{seven league boots} can be activated to teleport you across great distances.
        Other magic items constantly have magical effects.
        For example, a \mitem{ring of protection} passively grants you a defense bonus.

        The description of a magic item effect will specify what mechanical actions must be taken, if any, to activate the effects of the item.
        For example, a belt of healing requires taking a \glossterm{standard action}.
        However, the item description will not specify the exact nature of the action.
        Different items, even if they have the same effect, can have different physical actions that are required to activate the item.
        These activation actions can come in one of the following forms:
        \begin{itemize}
           \item Command word: You must speak a specific word that the item will hear and react to.
                For example, you may need to say the word ``healing'' in Elven to activate an item that heals you.
            \item Mental command: You must mentally direct the item to activate, such as by visualizing the item or thinking a particular word.
                % TODO: does this item exist
                For example, you may need to imagine a warm blanket around you to activate an item that protects you from cold damage or environmental effects.
            \item Physical motion: You must perform a specific physical motion, usually involving the item in some way.
                For example, you may need to rapidly stomp one foot on the ground to activate an item that allows you to move faster.
        \end{itemize}

        % TODO: table of random item activations?

    \subsection{Magic Item Limitations}

        There are three restrictions on your ability to use magic items.
        First, you cannot equip two apparel items that take up the same physical location on your body.
        For example, you cannot equip two different gauntlet sets and gain the effects of both, but you could equip several amulets or up to ten rings.

        Second, all magic items require you to attune to them to gain their effect unless they indicate otherwise in their description.
        You can attune to a magic item with the \textit{item attunement} ability, below.

        Third, you cannot attune to two items with the same name, or if one is simply a Greater or Lesser version of the other.

        \subsubsection{Item Attunement}\label{Item Attunement}

            As a standard action, you can use the \textit{item attunement} ability to attune to items.
            This is a \magical ability.

            \begin{attuneability}{Item Attunement}{\abilitytag{Attune}}
                \rankline
                Choose a magic item you are touching.
                Any abilities the target has that require attunement become active, allowing you to use its full potential.
            \end{attuneability}

            \parhead{Shared Item Attunement} Multiple creatures can attune to the same item simultaneously.
            Since most items only function while worn or wielded, this does not usually allow multiple creatures to gain the benefits of the item.
            However, the creatures can swap the item between them without having to reattune to it each time.

    \subsubsection{Magic Item Power}\label{Magic Item Power}
        The \glossterm{power} of an item is equal to twice its rank.
        An item's power also affects its defenses.
        Its Fortitude and Mental defenses are equal to 5 \add its \glossterm{power}.
        Its Armor defense and Reflex defense are not affected by its \glossterm{power}, and are solely determined by its size and shape.

    \subsection{Removing Magic Items}
        Unless otherwise noted, magic items that have effects on the creature using the item must continue to be worn or held as long as the effect lasts.
        If a magic item has an ability with a duration, removing the item also ends the ability.
        Items which are consumed when used or which do not affect their user are unaffected by this rule.

\section{Weapons}\label{Weapons}
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{equipment/weapons}

    Each weapon has a \glossterm{weapon group} and any number of \glossterm{weapon tags}.
    In addition, each weapon has a particular \glossterm{accuracy} modifier and defines a base \glossterm{dice pool} for attacks using that weapon.
    This section explains each of those concepts and defines the statistics for weapons in Rise.
    You gain a \plus1d bonus to your \glossterm{weapon damage} per 2 power (see \pcref{Weapon Damage}).

    Unless otherwise specified, a weapon must be held in a single \glossterm{free hand}.
    You can use two hands to hold a weapon if you want, but that provides no special benefit unless that weapon has the \weapontag{Versatile Grip} tag (see \pcref{Weapon Tags}).

    \subsection{Weapon Groups}\label{Weapon Groups}

        Weapons are organized into thematically related categories called weapon groups. They are described in \trefnp{Weapon Groups}. For example, all axes belong to the ``axes'' weapon group. Some weapons can be found in multiple weapon groups. For example, a dagger is a simple weapon, a blade, and a thrown weapon.

        \parhead{Exotic Weapons}\label{Exotic Weapons} Some weapons are rare and have unusual fighting styles.
        These weapons are called exotic weapons.
        Proficiency with a weapon group does not grant you with exotic weapons from that group.
        Some class abilities grant proficiency with exotic weapons.

        \begin{dtable!*}

                Club-like weapons  & Club, flanged mace, greatmace, mace, morning star, sap                        & Culacula, gnomish trick mace, knobkerrie, totokia          \\
                Crossbows          & Hand crossbow, heavy crossbow                                                 & Arbalest, repeating crossbow                               \\
                Flexible Weapons   & Flail, heavy flail, nunchaku, slapjack, whip                                  & Chain whip, meteor hammer, three-section staff             \\
                Headed weapons     & Light hammer, longhammer, pick, sickle, sledgehammer, warhammer               & Dwarven longhammer, dwarven shorthammer, heavy pick, obuch \\
                Improvised weapons & \tdash                                                                        & \tdash                                                     \\

                Polearms           & Bardiche, glaive, halberd, longhammer, poleaxe, quarterstaff, scythe          & Fauchard, war scythe                                       \\

            \end{dtabularx}
        \end{dtable!*}

        \subsubsection{Weapon Proficiency}\label{Weapon Proficiency}
            Each character is proficient with different weapon groups. These indicate the weapons that you can use effectively.
            You take a \minus2 accuracy penalty with weapons you are not proficient with.

        \subsubsection{Improvised Weapons}\label{Improvised Weapons}
            Sometimes objects not crafted to be weapons nonetheless see use in combat.
            You can choose to be proficient with the improvised weapons weapon group, which has no specific weapons associated with it but which allows you to pick up and use non-manufactured weapons without taking a nonproficiency penalty (see \pcref{Weapon Proficiency}).

            To determine the appropriate statistics for an improvised weapon, compare its shape and composition to the weapon list to find a reasonable match.
            An improvised weapon will generally have a \minus1 accuracy penalty, a \minus1d damage penalty, or be missing at least one weapon tag relative to a similarly structured manufactured weapon.

        \subsubsection{Natural Weapons}\label{Natural Weapons}
            Natural weapons are weapons that are part of a creature's body instead of being manufactured and wielded.
            Many monsters have natural weapons, like claws or a bite attack.
            Natural weapons do not normally require a \glossterm{free hand} to use.
            All bipedal creatures also have a punch/kick natural weapon.

        \parhead{Physical Size} Like all objects and creatures, weapons have a size category that represents how physically large they are. Most weapons are one size category smaller than their wielder, but \weapontag{Heavy} weapons are the same size category as the wielder.
        All weapons are \glossterm{lightweight} unless otherwise noted.

        \parhead{Inappropriately Sized Weapons}\label{Inappropriately Sized Weapons} You can use weapons that are sized for creatures that are one size category larger or smaller than you.
        However, you take a \minus2 accuracy penalty on attacks using an inappropriately sized weapon.

    \subsection{Weapon Range Limits}\label{Weapon Range Limits}
        Ranged weapon attacks become less accurate if the target is far away.
        Ranged weapons have two \glossterm{range limits} listed, with a slash between them, such as 90/270.
        The first number indicates the maximum range for a weapon's \glossterm{close range}.
        The second number indicates the maximum range for a weapon's \glossterm{long range}.
        You cannot attack a target that is beyond a weapon's long range limit.

        Attacks at close range have no penalty.
        Attacks at long range have a \minus4 accuracy penalty.
        This is called a \glossterm{longshot penalty}, and some abilities can reduce this penalty.

    \subsection{Drawing and Sheathing Weapons}\label{Drawing and Sheathing Weapons}
        Drawing and sheathing weapons always requires the hand or hands used to hold the weapon.
        The time it takes to draw and sheathe a weapon depends on how encumbering the weapon is.
        As a \glossterm{minor action}, you can draw or sheathe a single non-\weapontag{Heavy} weapon, assuming it is easy to access.
        You can also draw or sheathe a single \weapontag{Light} weapon as a separate free action.
        As a standard action, you can draw or sheathe any weapon, even if it is \weapontag{Heavy}, concealed, or otherwise difficult to access.
        Since you can only take any individual free action once per round, you can't draw or sheathe two weapons in the same round unless one of them is Light, or you spend a standard action.

        A character can only store a limited number of weapons in locations that are easy to access in combat.
        Generally, a humanoid creature can carry no more than five ordinary weapons or shields.
        A Heavy weapon takes up twice the space of an ordinary weapon, and a Light weapon takes up half that space.
        This means it would be reasonable to carry up to ten Light weapons, or two Heavy weapons plus a normal weapon.
        At the GM's discretion, characters with an excessive number of weapons or similar items readily available may increase their \glossterm{encumbrance}.

    \subsection{Weapon Tags}\label{Weapon Tags}
        Some weapons found on \trefnp{Weapons} have tags that indicate that they have special abilities. The list of abilities that weapons can have is given below.
        \weapontagdef{Ammunition} This weapon is designed to be fired by a projectile weapon or thrown in large quantities.
        It is cheaper to buy and craft, but it is usually \glossterm{broken} after being fired or thrown.
        \weapontagdef{Compact} This weapon is unusually small.
        It is one size category smaller than normal (that is, two size categories smaller than the creature it is intended for), though it is not \glossterm{lightweight} for that size.
        This makes it easier to conceal (see \pcref{Sleight of Hand}).
        In addition, you only take a \minus5 penalty to Stealth when trying to conceal strikes with a Compact weapon instead of the normal \minus10 or \minus20 penalty for concealing a strike (see \pcref{Stealth}).
        \weapontagdef{Forceful} Whenever you deal damage to a target no more than one size category larger than you with a strike using this weapon, you can \glossterm{knockback} the target up to 10 feet.
        On a critical hit, this knockback distance is doubled.
        \weapontagdef{Grappling} You gain a \plus2 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} on \glossterm{melee} attacks with this weapon against creatures who are \grappled by you.
        \weapontagdef{Heavy} Heavy weapons are larger and heavier than other weapons.
        You normally need two hands to use a Heavy weapon.
        If you have a Strength of 3 or higher, you can wield a Heavy weapon in one hand, but you take a \minus1 accuracy penalty with the weapon while doing so.
        While holding a Heavy weapon in two hands, you gain a \plus1d bonus per 3 \glossterm{power} to your \glossterm{weapon damage} with the weapon.
        This bonus is in addition to the normal bonus that you gain from your power with weapons (see \pcref{Weapon Damage}).
        \weapontagdef{Impact} When you get a \glossterm{critical hit} with this weapon, you deal maximum damage with the attack.
        This includes any \glossterm{extra damage} that applies to the attack.
        \weapontagdef{Keen} You gain a \plus4 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with \glossterm{strikes} using this weapon for the purpose of determining whether you get a \glossterm{critical hit}.
        \weapontagdef{Light} Light weapons are smaller and easier to handle than other weapons.
        Attacking with two weapons at once is more accurate with Light weapons (see \pcref{Dual Wielding}).
        In addition, Light weapons are easier to draw or sheathe (see \pcref{Drawing and Sheathing Weapons}).
        \weapontagdef{Long}\label{Long Weapon} This weapon can be used to make melee \glossterm{strikes} against targets up to 10 feet away from you.
        If you use an ability with more specific targets than simply making a melee strike, such as affecting ``all enemies adjacent to you'', this weapon tag does not increase your range with that ability.
        In addition, you can inflict \glossterm{critical hits} with melee \glossterm{strikes} using a Long weapon against creatures up to two size categories larger than you (see \pcref{Very Large Creatures}).
        \weapontagdef{Mounted}\label{Mounted Weapon} If you are mounted, and your mount moves in the same phase that you make a \glossterm{strike} with a Mounted weapon, you gain a \plus2 \glossterm{accuracy} bonus with the strike.
        \weapontagdef{Parrying} If a creature attacks you with a \glossterm{melee} \glossterm{strike} while you wield this weapon, you \glossterm{briefly} gain a \plus2 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with strikes using this weapon against that creature.
        \weapontagdef{Projectile} This weapon fires ammunition at range to deal damage.
        The ammunition generally breaks when used.
        Projectile weapons have two \glossterm{range limits} listed in their description (see \pcref{Weapon Range Limits}).
        They must be reloaded after being fired.
        The time required to reload a projectile weapon is given in the weapon description.
        You take a \minus4 accuracy penalty with Projectile weapons against creatures adjacent to you.
        While riding a moving mount, you take a \minus4 accuracy penalty with Projectile weapons, and your range limits are halved.
        \weapontagdef{Sweeping}\label{Sweeping} When you make a \glossterm{melee} \glossterm{strike} with this weapon, you may also target one or more secondary creatures or objects adjacent to you.
        If the weapon also has the \weapontag{Long} weapon tag, each secondary target may instead be within 10 feet of you.
        Each secondary target must be within 10 feet of a primary target, and must not already be a target of the strike.
        The strike affects each secondary target in the same way as the primary targets.
        Sweeping weapons have a number that indicates the number of secondary targets you can affect.
        \weapontagdef{Subdual} This weapon deals \glossterm{subdual damage} (see \pcref{Subdual Damage}).
        % (30/60) is one improvement, (60/120) is two.
        \weapontagdef{Thrown} This weapon is designed to be thrown to deal damage at range.
        Thrown weapons have two \glossterm{range limits} listed in their description (see \pcref{Weapon Range Limits}).
        Unless otherwise noted in a weapon's description, a throwing weapon can be used to attack in melee without penalty.

        Heavy thrown weapons require a standard action to throw, rather being thrown as part of any \glossterm{strike} like normal.
        They are not always physically thrown with two hands, but they require the use of your entire body to propel the weapon, so you are not considered to have any \glossterm{free hands} while throwing a heavy thrown weapon.
        \weapontagdef{Tripping} When you use the \ability{trip} ability, you can attack with this weapon instead of with a free hand (see \pcref{Trip}).
        This allows you to deal damage with the weapon if you successfully trip the target.
        \weapontagdef{Versatile Grip} This weapon is designed to be held in either one hand or two hands.
        While holding this weapon in two hands, you gain a \plus1d damage bonus to your \glossterm{weapon damage} with it, plus \plus1d per 3 \glossterm{power}.
        This bonus is in addition to the normal bonus that you gain from your power with weapons (see \pcref{Weapon Damage}).

    \subsection{Weapon Table}
        Here is the format for weapon entries in the Weapons table, below.

        \parhead{Accuracy} This number modifies your \glossterm{accuracy} with \glossterm{strikes} using the weapon.

        \parhead{Damage} This \glossterm{dice pool} indicates the damage dealt by the weapon on a hit.

        \parhead{Damage Type} This indicates the type of the damage dealt by the weapon.
        Some monsters may be \trait{impervious} or immune to attacks from certain damage types.

        Some weapons deal damage of multiple types. If a weapon is of two types, the damage it deals is not half one type and half another; all of it is both types.
        Therefore, a creature would have to be immune to both types of damage to ignore any of the damage from such a weapon.
        For details, see \pcref{Multiple Damage Types}.

        In other cases, a weapon can deal either of two types of damage.
        The wielder chooses which type of damage to deal when they make each \glossterm{strike} with the weapon.

        \parhead{Item Rank (Cost)} The first value indicates the \glossterm{item rank} of the item (see \pcref{Item Ranks}).
        The second value in parentheses indicates the average cost to buy the item.
        Items crafted for unusually large or small creatures are more expensive.
        For each size category larger or smaller than Medium, the item's rank increases by one, which increases its price.

        \parhead{Weapon Tags} Some weapons have special properties. See \pcref{Weapon Tags} for details.

        % All weapons should have two improvements over a ``baseline'' +0a/1d6 weapon with no properties.
        % The Light weapon tag comes with an invisible +1a/-1d modifier, so +1a/1d4 with one extra improvement.
        % The Heavy weapon tag does not cost a tag slot and comes with an invisible +1d modifier, so +0a/1d8 with two extra improvements.

    \subsection{Individual Weapon Descriptions}
        Some weapons in \trefnp{Weapons} have additional abilities which are described below.
        \parhead{Arbalest} You draw an arbalest back by turning a small winch. Loading an arbalest requires two standard actions.
        Each standard action requires one \glossterm{free hand} while holding the arbalest in another hand.
        \parhead{Armblade} This weapon is not held in a hand.
        Instead, it is affixed to the arm of body armor with a medium or heavy \glossterm{usage class}.
        When you attack with an armblade, you cannot use the arm it is attached to for any other combat purpose in the same phase.
        You can still hold items in that hand, but they have no combat effect.
        If you are not proficient with this weapon, you increase your \glossterm{encumbrance} by 2 when wearing armor with an armblade.
        \parhead{Armor Spikes} Any \glossterm{body armor} can be spiked.
        You normally can't attack with armor spikes.
        However, if your armor is spiked and you are proficient with it, you deal damage with it when you make a successful \textit{grapple} or \textit{shove} attack.
        Your \glossterm{power} is halved for the purpose of this damage, and this damage is not doubled if you get a critical hit with the grapple or shove attack.
        This damage cannot be combined with other effects that deal damage with a shove.
        \parhead{Bladed Whip} A bladed whip can be used to attack targets within 15 feet instead of the normal 10 feet for a Long weapon.
        \parhead{Boot Dagger} A boot dagger is a modified boot or boot sole which contains a hidden dagger.
        The dagger is normally concealed, and requires an Awareness check with a \glossterm{difficulty value} of 15 to find.
        Attacking with a boot dagger does not require a \glossterm{free hand}, but you must make a Balance check with a \glossterm{difficulty value} of 10 during whenever you attack with it.
        If you fail this check, you fall \prone after the attack.

        After you attack with a boot dagger, the dagger remains plainly visible.
        Concealing the dagger again requires a standard action.
        \parhead{Claw Sheathe} A claw sheathe is not a weapon on its own.
        Instead, it wraps around one of your natural weapons.
        This gives no intrinsic benefit, but claw sheathes can be imbued with magic weapon properties that apply to the wrapped natural weapon.
        Claw sheathes are made for claws, but an equivalent can be made for any natural weapon that requires a free hand to use, such as a slam.
        \parhead{Crossbow, Hand} You can draw a hand crossbow back by hand. Loading a hand crossbow is a \glossterm{free action} that requires one \glossterm{free hand} while holding the crossbow in another hand.
        \parhead{Crossbow, Heavy} You draw a heavy crossbow back by turning a small winch.
        Loading a heavy crossbow is a standard action that requires one \glossterm{free hand} while holding the crossbow in another hand.
        A heavy crossbow is the same size category as the creature it is sized for.
        \parhead{Crossbow, Repeating} The repeating crossbow holds 5 crossbow bolts. As long as it holds bolts, you can reload it as a \glossterm{free action} by pulling the reloading lever with one \glossterm{free hand}. Loading a new case of 5 bolts is a \glossterm{standard action} that requires one \glossterm{free hand} while holding the crossbow in another hand.
        \parhead{Flatbow} You need both hands to fire a bow. One hand is free when not firing the bow. Loading a bow is a free action that requires one \glossterm{free hand} while holding the flatbow in another hand. A flatbow is too unwieldy to use while you are mounted.
        Unlike a longbow, a flatbow is flat when not under tension and has approximately rectangular limbs.
        This spreads stress more evenly over the bow's structure, allowing more precise shots, though the firing technique is different and less commonly known.
        A flatbow is the same size category as the creature it is sized for.
        \parhead{Fire Arrows} These arrows are treated with alchemist's fire so they can be ignited before being shot.
        The process requires thickening the arrow shaft, reducing the precision of the arrow.
        It takes a \glossterm{free action} to ignite a fire arrow assuming you have access to an active flame the size of a torch or larger.
        \parhead{Lightning Arrows} These arrows are treated with a reactive alchemical substance so they deal electricity damage on contact.
        The process requires thickening the arrow shaft, reducing the precision of the arrow.
        \parhead{Longbow} You need both hands to fire a bow. One hand is free when not firing the bow. Loading a bow is a free action that requires one \glossterm{free hand} while holding the bow in the other hand.
        A longbow is the same size category as the creature it is sized for.
        \parhead{Net} A net is used to entangle enemies. When you throw a net, you make an attack vs. Reflex against your target. If you hit, the target is \slowed.
        \par A netted creature can escape with a \glossterm{difficulty value} 10 Flexibility check (normally a standard action). The net has 10 hit points and can be burst with a \glossterm{difficulty value} 10 Strength check as a standard action.
        \par A net has no effect on creatures that are Tiny or smaller, or Huge or larger. It must be folded to be thrown effectively, which takes a minute of work. You take a \minus4 accuracy penalty with an unfolded net.
        \parhead{Pike} A pike can be used to attack targets within 15 feet instead of the normal 10 feet for a Long weapon.
        However, you cannot use it to attack targets adjacent to you.
        \parhead{Punch/Kick} All bipedal creatures have access to the punch/kick \glossterm{natural weapon}.
        Normally, this represents a punch, which requires a \glossterm{free hand}.
        If you are trained in the Balance skill or have a Dexterity of at least 2, you can make it a kick, which does not require a free hand.
        \parhead{Shortbow} You need both hands to fire a shortbow, even though it is a medium \glossterm{usage class}. One hand is free when not firing the bow. Loading a bow is a free action that requires one \glossterm{free hand} while holding the shortbow in another hand.
        Unlike most \weapontag{Projectile} weapons, your range limits are not penalized when firing a shortbow while riding a moving mount, and the accuracy penalty is reduced to \minus2 instead of \minus4.
        \parhead{Sling} You can fire, but not load, a sling with one hand. Loading a sling is a free action that requires both hands.
        \par You can hurl ordinary stones with a sling, but stones are not as dense or as round as bullets. You take a -1 accuracy penalty with ordinary stones.
        \parhead{Spiked Knee} This weapon is not held in a hand.
        Instead, it is affixed to the leg of body armor with a medium or heavy \glossterm{usage class} (see \pcref{Armor Usage Classes}).
        If you are not proficient with this weapon, you increase your \glossterm{encumbrance} by 2 when wearing armor with a spiked knee.
        \parhead{Takedown Bow} A takedown bow is a bow assembled from multiple independent components that can be reconfigured into two different combinations.
        In its longbow configuration, it functions like a longbow, and in its shortbow configuration, it functions like a shortbow.
        In addition, when it is fully disassembled, it takes up space equivalent to a light usage class weapon, making it easier to transport and conceal.
        \parhead{Tower Shield} Although you can hold a tower shield in one hand, it is considered a \weapontag{Heavy} weapon because of its weight.
        You would typically have to support it with your other hand to effectively smash it into an enemy.
        \parhead{Whip} A whip can be used to attack targets within 15 feet instead of the normal 10 feet for a Long weapon.

    \subsection{Weapon Special Materials}\label{Weapon Special Materials}
        Nonmagical weapons can be made from special materials that can alter the properties of the item.
        These special materials are described in \trefnp{Weapon Special Materials}.
        Depending on the construction of the weapon, it may be entirely composed of the special material, or it may only have its striking surface altered.
        For example, a dragonfang spear may have a wooden haft and still gain the full benefits of being a dragonfang weapon.
        An adamantine club would only have a thin layer of adamantine around the outside, rather than being entirely forged from adamantine, because the weight and cost would otherwise be absurd.

        A weapon that is made from a special material cannot have any magic item properties, and cannot be chosen as a \glossterm{legacy item}.
        Projectile weapons cannot be made from special materials.
        However, the ammunition fired by projectile weapons can be made from special materials.

        Any individual weapon can only ever gain the combat benefits of a single special material, even if it contains multiple special materials in its construction.
        That special material is chosen at the time the weapon is crafted and cannot be altered without recrafting it.

        \parhead{Adamantine} An adamantine weapon has a \plus1d bonus to its damage dice, and deals double damage to objects.
        Golems and other object-like animate creatures are often \glossterm{vulnerable} to adamantine weapons.

        \parhead{Adamantine, Pure} A pure adamantine weapon has a \plus2d bonus to its damage dice, and deals triple damage to objects.
        Golems and other object-like animate creatures are often \glossterm{vulnerable} to adamantine weapons.

        \parhead{Cold Iron} Many fey creatures and some demons are \glossterm{vulnerable} to cold iron weapons.

        \parhead{Diamondsteel} A diamondsteel weapon grants you a \plus2 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with \glossterm{strikes} using it for the purpose of determining whether you get a \glossterm{critical hit}.

        \parhead{Diamondsteel, Pure} A pure diamondsteel weapon grants you a \plus4 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with \glossterm{strikes} using it for the purpose of determining whether you get a \glossterm{critical hit}.

        \parhead{Dragonfang} Damage dealt by a dragonfang weapon is damage of the type dealt by that dragon's breath weapon in addition to its normal damage types (see \tref{Dragon Types}).

        \parhead{Dragonfang, Ancient} Damage dealt by a pure dragonfang weapon is damage of the type dealt by that dragon's breath weapon in addition to its normal damage types (see \tref{Dragon Types}).
        In addition, as a standard action, you can make a \glossterm{strike} using the weapon that takes the form of a breath weapon emitted from the weapon.
        If the dragon's breath weapon is normally a line, the strike targets everything in a \arealarge, 10 ft. wide line from you.
        Otherwise, the strike targets everything in a \areamed cone from you.
        After you use this ability, you \glossterm{briefly} cannot use it again.

        \parhead{Mithral} A mithral weapon has a \plus1 accuracy bonus and a \minus1d penalty to its damage dice.

        \parhead{Mithral, Pure} A pure mithral weapon has a \plus2 accuracy bonus and a \minus2d penalty to its damage dice.

        \parhead{Silvered} Lycanthropes and some undead are \glossterm{vulnerable} to silvered weapons.

\section{Magic Weapons}
    Magic weapons improve a character's combat abilities.
    They must be wielded to gain their effects.

\section{Armor}\label{Armor}
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{equipment/armor}

    Most characters use armor to protect themselves. There are two kinds of armor: \glossterm{body armor}, such as full plate armor, and \glossterm{shields}.
    Body armor is worn on your body.
    You can only benefit from one body armor at a time.
    If you somehow wear multiple layers of body armor, the penalties stack and the benefits do not stack.
    A shield requires a free hand instead of being worn on the body.

    \subsection{Armor Mechanics}

        \subsubsection{Armor Usage Classes}\label{Armor Usage Classes}
            An armor's \glossterm{usage class} is a measure of how the armor is used, and how much effort is required to use it.
            It indicates whether armor, when used by a creature the armor is sized for, is considered light armor, medium armor, or heavy armor.

        \subsubsection{Armor Proficiency}\label{Armor Proficiency}
            Proficiency with armor is defined by the armor's usage class.
            If you wear or use armor you are not proficient with, it provides half its normal defense bonus.
            In addition, you apply that armor's \glossterm{encumbrance} as a penalty to your \glossterm{accuracy}.
            Since standard shields have no \glossterm{encumbrance}, you can use them without penalizing your attacks.

        \subsubsection{Getting Into And Out Of Armor}
            The time required to don armor depends on its type; see \trefnp{Donning Armor}. Donning and removing body armor and shields takes both hands.
            \parhead{Don} This column tells how long it takes a character to put the armor on. (One minute is 10 rounds.)
            \parhead{Remove} This column tells how long it takes to get the armor off.

            \begin{dtable}
                \lcaption{Donning Armor}
                \begin{dtabularx}{\columnwidth}{>{\lcol}X c c}
                    \tb{Armor Type}   & \tb{Don}          & \tb{Remove} \tableheaderrule
                    Light shield      & 1 minor action    & 1 minor action           \\
                    Medium shield     & 1 standard action & 1 standard action       \\
                    Tower shield      & 1 standard action & 1 standard action       \\
                    Light body armor  & 1 minute          & 1 minute\fn{1}          \\
                    Medium body armor & 4 minutes\fn{1}   & 1 minute\fn{1}          \\
                    Heavy body armor  & 4 minutes\fn{2}   & 1d4\plus1 minutes\fn{1} \\
                \end{dtabularx}
                1 If the character has some help, cut this time in half. A single character doing nothing else can help one or two adjacent characters. Two characters can't help each other don armor at the same time. \\
                2 The wearer must have help to don this armor.
            \end{dtable}

        \subsubsection{Weight and Size}
            The size category of body armor is the same as the size category of the creature it is sized for.
            Bucklers and standard shields are one size category smaller than the creature they are sized for, while tower shields are the same size category as the creature they are sized for.
            All armor and shields except for heavy body armor are \glossterm{lightweight} objects.
            In general, heavy body armor weighs so much that only creatures with a Strength of at least 1 can wear it (see \pcref{Weight Limits}).

    \subsection{Armor Table}
        \par Here is the format for armor entries (given as column headings on \trefnp{Armor and Shields}, below).

        \parhead{Defense} This value indicates how much the armor increases your Armor defense.

        \parhead{Damage Resistance} This value indicates how much the armor increases your \glossterm{damage resistance} (see \pcref{Damage Resistance}).

        \parhead{Encumbrance} This value indicates how much the armor increases your \glossterm{encumbrance}.
        You apply your encumbrance as a penalty to all Strength and Dexterity-based checks and skills.
        For details, see \pcref{Encumbrance}.

        \parhead{Speed} This penalty applies to speed with all of your \glossterm{movement modes} while wearing the armor.

        \parhead{Dex Bonus} This multiplier affects the contribution of your Dexterity to your Armor defense.
        It does not change any other effects that Dexterity has.

        \parhead{Item Rank (Cost)} The first value indicates the \glossterm{item rank} of the item (see \pcref{Item Ranks}).
        The second value in parentheses indicates the average cost to buy the item.
        Items crafted for unusually large or small creatures are more expensive.
        For each size category larger or smaller than Medium, the item's rank increases by one, which increases its price.

            1 The hand holding the shield is not free, which may limit your actions. \\

    \subsection{Individual Armor Descriptions}
        Any special benefits or accessories to the types of armor found on \trefnp{Armor and Shields} are described below.
        \parhead{Armor Spikes} You can add armor spikes to any \glossterm{body armor}.
        Armor spikes are a \glossterm{weapon} that you can deal damage with (see \tref{Weapons}).
        \parhead{Breastplate} It comes with a helmet and greaves.
        \parhead{Buckler} This small metal shield is worn strapped to your forearm.
        You can treat the hand using a buckler as a \glossterm{free hand}.
        However, if you wield weapons or otherwise take actions using the arm bearing the buckler, you do not gain the buckler's defensive bonus during that phase.
        \par You can't bash someone with a buckler.
        \parhead{Chain Shirt} A chain shirt comes with a steel cap.
        \parhead{Full Plate} The suit includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and a thick layer of padding that is worn underneath the armor. Each suit of full plate must be individually fitted to its owner by a master armorsmith, although a captured suit can be resized to fit a new owner with a day of work and a \glossterm{difficulty value} 10 Craft (metalworking) check. The new owner must still be of the same size category as the size category that the suit was designed for.
        \parhead{Shield, Standard, Wooden or Steel} You strap a shield to your forearm and grip it with your hand.
        A standard shield is so cumbersome that you can't use your shield hand for anything else.
        You can use a standard shield as a weapon (see \tref{Weapons}).
        However, you cannot \glossterm{dual wield} with a shield.
        \parhead{Shield, Tower} This massive shield is nearly as tall as an average human.
        When you take the \textit{total defense} action while wielding a tower shield, you gain a \plus2 bonus to Armor defense in addition to the normal bonuses from taking that action (see \pcref{Total Defense}).
        A tower shield is so cumbersome that you can't use your shield hand for anything else.
        You can use a tower shield as an \glossterm{exotic weapon} (see \tref{Exotic Weapons}).
        However, you cannot \glossterm{dual wield} with a shield.

        While wielding a tower shield, you take a \minus1 penalty to \glossterm{accuracy} because of the shield's unwieldy nature.
        \parhead{Shield Spikes} These spikes improve the effectiveness of a standard shield or tower shield when used as a weapon.
        You gain a \plus1d damage bonus with attacks using a spiked shield, and damage dealt by the strike is piercing damage in addition to any other damage types.
        You can't put spikes on a buckler.
        \parhead{Studded Leather} The studs on studded leather are made of metal, but this amount of metal is not generally enough to make the item count as being made of metal.
        Studded leather armor made with studs from special materials does not grant the wearer the properties of the special material.

    \subsection{Armor Special Materials}\label{Armor Special Materials}
        \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{equipment/armor special materials}
        Nonmagical body armor can be made from special materials that can alter the properties of the item.
        These special materials are described in \trefnp{Armor Special Materials}.
        The benefits here only apply to body armor that is fully made from the given special material.
        If you combine multiple special materials in any way, such as by wearing deepforged gauntlets with a mithral breastplate, you do not gain any benefits for having special materials.

        Body armor that is made from a special material cannot have any magic item properties, and cannot be chosen as a \glossterm{legacy item}.

        In addition, it increases the \glossterm{encumbrance} of the armor by 2.
        When you use the \ability{recover} ability while wearing starmetal body armor, you also regain an amount of \glossterm{damage resistance} equal to half the damage resistance provided by the armor.
        This effect is \abilitytag{Swift}, like the \ability{recover} ability.
        The armor's item rank is increased by 4, which increases the typical cost to buy the item (see \pcref{Item Ranks}).

\section{Magic Armor}
    Magic body armor must be worn to gain its effects, while magic shields must be wielded.

    \subsection{Magic Armor and Damage Resistance}
        While you are attuned to magical body armor, that armor gains a multiplier to the damage resistance it provides.
        This multiplier does not apply to any special properties the armor might have, such as a magic bonus to your damage resistance.
        It only applies to the normal damage resistance normally provided by body armor of that type.
        The magnitude of the multiplier is based on the magic item's rank, as listed below.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Rank 0--3: \mult1
            \item Rank 4: \mult2
            \item Rank 5: \mult3
            \item Rank 6: \mult4
            \item Rank 7: \mult6
        \end{itemize}

\section{Magic Apparel}

    Magic apparel items must be worn to gain their effects.

    \subsection{Body Slots}
        The main limiting factor on how many items you can have equipped is your attunement points, not the physical location of your items on your body.
        However, there are limits to how many items you can wear of the same type, as described below.
        For item types not listed here, use reasonable judgment about what would be plausible.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Amulet: Up to 3
            \item Belt: Up to 3
            \item Boots: Up to 1
            \item Circlet: Up to 1
            \item Cloak: Up to 3
            \item Gauntlets: Up to 1 (separate from gloves)
            \item Gloves: Up to 1 (separate from gauntlets)
            \item Rings: Up to 5 per hand
        \end{itemize}

\section{Magic Implements}\label{Implements}
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{equipment/magic implements}
    Implements can take many forms: staffs, wands, holy symbols, and more.
    Like magic weapons, magic implements must be wielded to gain their effects.
    However, while weapons are used to deal damage to enemies, implements are used to cast spells.

    \parhead{Somatic Components} While wielding an implement, you may gesture with it and channel magic through it.
    These qualify as somatic components for the purpose of casting spells.
    This does not remove the possibility of \glossterm{somatic component failure}.

    \subsection{Implement Types}

        \subsubsection{Holy Symbols}

            \parhead{Physical Description} A typical holy symbol is a no larger than 4 inches in each dimension and can be easily held in the palm of a hand.
            Most holy symbols are metal, but they can be made from wood, bone, or even more exotic materials, depending on the deity they symbolize.

            \parhead{Special Rules} All holy symbols are implements for divine spells.
            Most holy symbols are designed to be worn as an amulet in addition to being held in the hand.
            A magical holy symbol grants its magical abilities if it is either worn as an amulet or held in the hand.

        \subsubsection{Staffs}

            \parhead{Physical Description} A typical staff is 3 feet to 7 feet long and 2 inches to 3 inches thick, weighing about 5 pounds.
            Most staffs are wood, but a rare few are bone, metal, or even glass.
            Staffs often have a gem or some device at their tip or are shod in metal at one or both ends.

            Staffs are often decorated with carvings or runes.
            Long staffs are quarterstaffs.
            They must be held in two hands, and can be used to attack like any other quarterstaff.
            Short staffs resemble thin clubs.
            They can be held in one hand, but are not suitable for combat and are treated as \glossterm{improvised weapons} if used to attack.
            A typical staff has 20 \glossterm{hit points} and a sunder \glossterm{difficulty value} of 10.

        \subsubsection{Wands}

            \parhead{Physical Description} A typical wand is 6 inches to 12 inches long and about 1/4 inch thick, and usually weighs no more than 1 ounce.
            Most wands are wood, but some are bone.
            A rare few are metal, glass, or even ceramic, but these are quite exotic.
            Occasionally, a wand has a gem or some device at its tip, and most are decorated with carvings or runes.
            A typical wand has 5 \glossterm{hit points} and a sunder \glossterm{difficulty value} of 5.

\section{Tools, Goods, and Mounts}
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{equipment/tools goods and mounts}

    The world of Rise has a wide range of minor items like backpacks, blankets, and ten-foot poles.
    In general, the cost of those items is so insignificant from the perspective of an adventuring party that it's not worth the effort to track their cost in detail.
    A subset of particularly expensive items is included in \tref{Consumable Tools} and \tref{Permanent Tools, Goods, and Mounts}.

    \subsection{Standard Adventuring Kit}
        % Technically 15.2 gp and 50.5 pounds
        A standard adventuring kit costs 10 gp, weighs 50 pounds, and contains the following items:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Backpack
            \item Bedroll
            \item Flint and steel
            \item Rations, trail (8 days)
            \item Rope, hempen (60 ft.)
            \item Sack (empty)
            \item Tent
