\subcf{Air -- Voice of the Wind}
As a standard action, the cleric can spend a devotion point to command the air around him.
He can command it to perform a task that lasts up to 5 minutes, and which does not take place farther than 300 feet from him.
He cannot compel the air to go faster than 10 mph, which is not fast enough to significantly affect creatures in combat.
The air can only understand simple instructions, such as ``Blow southeast for one minute'' or ``Blow out the torch at the end of the hall''.
\subcf{Chaos -- Sow Chaos}
As a standard action, the cleric can spend a devotion point to cause an improbable event to occur.
He can visualize in general terms what he wants to happen, such as ``Make the bartender leave the bar''.
However, he has no control over the exact nature of the event, or even whether the event is beneficial for him.
Instead, roll a d20 when this ability is used.
A roll of 11 or higher means the event is generally beneficial for the cleric.
A roll of 5 or lower means the event is general detrimental to the cleric.
A roll from 6 to 10 means the event is neither good nor bad for the cleric.
\subcf{Death -- Reaper's Boon}
