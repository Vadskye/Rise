\chapter{Monsters}

Monsters are all of the various non-humanoid creatures that exist in the world of Rise.
Many of them are dangerous, and adventurers may need to fight them.
This chapter describes the rules for monsters, and the combat statistics for a variety of monsters.

\section{Monster Mechanics}
    Like player characters, monsters have levels, attributes, and abilities.
    However, they do not have classes, legacy items, or many other elements of characters.
    This section defines how monsters function.

    \subsection{Level}
        Each monster has a level that indicates its approximate strength.
        This has all of the same effects as the level for a player character, except that monsters do not gain any of the benefits described in \tref{Character Advancement}.

    \subsection{Challenge Rating}\label{Challenge Rating}
        Each monster has a \glossterm{challenge rating} that indicates its approximate strength within its level, ranging from 1/2 to 4.
        A monster's challenge rating is a guideline to how many of that monster should typically be present in an encounter (see \pcref{Encounter Balancing}).
        This has several effects on the monster's statistics, as decribed in \trefnp{Challenge Rating Effects}.

        \begin{dtable}
            \lcaption{Challenge Rating Effects}

                1       & \mult1/2        & 1                    & 0 & \plus0 \\
                2       & \mult1          & 2                    & 1 & \plus1 \\
                3       & \mult2          & 3                    & 2 & \plus2 \\
                4       & \mult4          & 4                    & 3 & \plus3 \\
            \end{dtabularx}

            2. See \pcref{Half CR Monsters}. \\
        \end{dtable}

        \subsubsection{Monster CR Bonuses}
            For each challenge rating a monster has above 1, it gains a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy}, \glossterm{defenses}, and \glossterm{power}.

        \subsubsection{Monster Vital Wounds}
            Monsters do not normally make \glossterm{vital rolls} like player characters do.
            Instead, once a monster takes at least as many \glossterm{vital wounds} as its \glossterm{challenge rating}, it is defeated.
            Defeated monsters may be unconscious, dead, or merely flee the fight at the discretion of the Game Master.

            Some monsters have specific mechanics for what happens if they gain \glossterm{vital wounds}.
            Unless otherwise specified on the monster's description, \glossterm{vital wounds} have no negative effects on monsters.

        \subsubsection{Half CR Monsters}\label{Half CR Monsters}
            Monsters with a CR of 1/2 have no \glossterm{hit points} or \glossterm{wound resistance}.
            In addition, their \glossterm{vital resistance} is one quarter of the normal value after taking into account all other modifiers.

        \subsubsection{Spending Resources}
            Monsters with a CR of 1 or less are unable to use abilities that cause them to lose \glossterm{hit points}, such as the \textit{sprint} ability (see \pcref{Sprint}).
            Unless otherwise noted, all monsters are unable to use abilities that would cause them to gain \glossterm{fatigue points}, such as the \textit{desperate exertion} ability.

        \subsubsection{Recovering Hit Points and Conditions}
            Monsters cannot normally use the \textit{recover} ability.
            However, monsters with a high challenge rating can remove conditions automatically.
            At the end of each round, monsters with CR of 1 or higher roll 1d10 \add their CR.
            If the result is 11 or higher, the monster removes one condition of its choice.
            This effect cannot remove a condition applied during the current round.
            Monsters without a sufficient understanding of the conditions affecting them generally choose randomly.

        \subsubsection{Monster Actions}
            All monsters are able to take \glossterm{free actions}.
            CR 1 or higher monsters can take \glossterm{minor actions}.
            Some monsters, including many high CR monsters, can either take additional actions each round or use powerful abilities as minor actions.
            These special abilities are listed in their descriptions.

    \subsection{Attributes}
        Each of a monster's base attributes can range from \minus9 to 3, as appropriate for the type of monster.
        A monster's attributes scale with level in the same way as character attributes.
        A monster can also have up to two attributes starting at 4 or 5.
        In general, a monster with higher starting attributes will be slightly stronger, but not all monsters need to start with the same starting attribute total.

    \subsection{Encounter Balancing}\label{Encounter Balancing}
        In general, a group of PCs of a given level will have an appropriate challenge from fighting monsters of the same level with a combined challenge rating equal to the number of PCs.
        Fighting monsters of a lower level, or monsters whose combined challenge rating is less than the number of PCs, will yield an easier encounter.
        Fighting monsters of a higher level, or fighting monsters whose combined challenge rating is greater than the number of PCs, will yield an easier encounter.

        It is generally not a good idea for PCs to fight monsters more than three levels higher or lower than their own.
        They may find that their attacks always miss, or never miss, and other aspects of the encounter may be similarly imbalanced in ways that are not easily remedied by simply changing the number of enemies.
