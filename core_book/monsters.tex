\chapter{Monster Mechanics}

Monsters are all of the various non-humanoid creatures that exist in the world of Rise.
Many of them are dangerous, and adventurers may need to fight them.
This chapter describes the rules for monsters, and the combat statistics for a variety of monsters.

\section{Monster Statistics}
    Like player characters, monsters have levels, attributes, and abilities.
    However, they do not have classes, insight points, or many other elements of characters.
    This section defines how monsters function.

    \subsection{Monster Roles}
        Each monster has a role.
        A monster's role influences its statistics, and generally indicates the way it fights.
        There are six roles: brute, skirmisher, warrior, sniper, mystic, and leader.
        The effects of each role are described below.

        \subsubsection{Brute}
            A typical brute rushes into melee and smashes its enemies with highly damaging attacks.
            Brutes have relatively low damage resistance, but they can absorb a surprising amount of punishment.
            Most brutes charge directly at the enemy and fight in melee, though some prefer to use a few ranged attacks before entering the fray.

            \parhead{Defenses} \plus4 Armor, \plus4 Fortitude, \plus4 Reflex, \plus4 Mental
            \parhead{Survival} \plus4 level for hit points

        \subsubsection{Skirmisher}
            A typical skirmisher uses its high mobility to fight only when it is advantageous to do so.
            Skirmishers can be hard to hit, though they are vulnerable to attacks that can't be dodged.
            They are likely to avoid intimidating front-line fighters.
            Instead, they ambush the vulnerable back lines if possible.

            \parhead{Defenses} \plus4 Armor, \plus4 Fortitude, \plus6 Reflex, \plus4 Mental
            \parhead{Survival} \plus2 level for damage resistance

        \subsubsection{Warrior}
            A typical warrior forms a defensive front line to protect any vulnerable allies.
            Warriors have high defenses, and can be very difficult to kill.
            However, they tend to lack offensive power and mobility, so they risk being outflanked and irrelevant.

            \parhead{Defenses} \plus6 Armor, \plus4 Fortitude, \plus4 Reflex, \plus4 Mental
            \parhead{Survival} \plus2 level for hit points, \plus4 level for damage resistance

        \subsubsection{Sniper}
            A typical sniper uses ranged attacks while staying as far away from combat as possible.
            Snipers tend to be fragile, so they can be quickly dispatched by creatures that are able to close the distance.

            \parhead{Defenses} \plus3 Armor, \plus4 Fortitude, \plus4 Reflex, \plus4 Mental
            \parhead{Survival} No bonuses

        \subsubsection{Mystic}
            A typical mystic uses exclusively magical abilities, and their offensive capabilities can be highly varied.
            Mystics try to avoid melee combat because their physical defenses are low, but magical protections mean they can resist attacks effectively.

            \parhead{Defenses} \plus2 Armor, \plus4 Fortitude, \plus4 Reflex, \plus6 Mental
            \parhead{Survival} \plus4 level for damage resistance

        \subsubsection{Leader}
            A typical leader commands their allies from behind the front lines, but is willing to enter the fray to protect more vulnerable allies.
            Leaders have well-rounded statistics, but they do not generally fight well alone.
            Instead, they tend to be more effective when aiding or commanding their allies.

            \parhead{Defenses} \plus4 Armor, \plus4 Fortitude, \plus4 Reflex, \plus4 Mental
            \parhead{Survival} \plus2 level for hit points, \plus2 level for damage resistance

    \subsection{Level Scaling}
        Each monster has a level that indicates its approximate strength.
        Monsters have some specific level scaling rules that differ from the rules for player characters.
        This scaling is summarized in \tref{Monster Advancement}.
        In general, their automatic level scaling is designed to keep them on par with the power that player characters gain at higher levels, but without all of the complexity of high-level PCs.
        High level monsters should have slightly higher base values for their attributes, though this is not quantified, since monster attributes can be highly varied.
        They have the following specific changes.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Monsters do not gain insight points, attunement points, or legacy items.
            \item Monsters have twice the base damage resistance of a player character.
            \item Monsters gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} at 6th level and 18th level.
            \item Monsters gain a \plus1 bonus to all defenses at 12th level.
        \end{itemize}

    \end{dtable*}

    \subsection{Elite Monsters}\label{Elite Monsters}
        Elite monsters are approximately four times as strong as an ordinary monster.
        They have a number of benefits and modifiers to make them more appropriate as a solo encounter than simply using a very high level ordinary monster:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Elite monsters gain a \plus2 bonus to their \glossterm{accuracy} and all \glossterm{defenses}.
            \item Elite monsters have four times the \glossterm{hit points} and \glossterm{damage resistance} of standard monsters.
            \item Elite monsters can have a maximum attribute of 6 (see \pcref{Monster Attributes}).
            \item Elite monsters double their damage and healing with all abilities. This stacks multiplicatively with any other modifiers, so an elite monster using a double damage attack would deal four times the damage of a normal monster's attack.
            \item Elite monsters can take an additional \glossterm{elite action} each round (see \pcref{Elite Actions}).
            \item Elite monsters automatically remove excess \glossterm{conditions} (see \pcref{Monster Conditions}).
        \end{itemize}

        \subsection{Monster Vital Wounds}
            Monsters do not normally make vital rolls like player characters do.
            Unless otherwise specified on the monster's description, vital wounds have no negative effects on monsters.
            Instead, once a monster gains a vital wound, it is defeated.
            Defeated monsters may be unconscious, dead, or merely flee the fight at the discretion of the Game Master.

        \subsection{Monster Conditions}\label{Monster Conditions}
            Monsters normally can't use the \textit{recover} ability, since they cannot use abilities which would increase their \glossterm{fatigue level}.
            Standard monsters can only remove \glossterm{conditions} by taking a \glossterm{short rest}.
            However, elite monsters can remove conditions automatically.

            Whenever an elite monster gains a unique condition, it is added to a ``condition track''.
            The track starts at 1 and goes up to 10.
            The first condition would be noted as a 1, the second condition would be noted as a 2, and so on.
            If a monster gains two instances of the same condition, they are put in the same location on the track.

            At the end of each round, each elite monster rolls 1d10.
            If the result matches an existing condition on its condition track that the monster did not gain during the current round, that condition is removed.
            When a monster has multiple copies of the same condition, only one instance of that condition is removed, so it may have to roll the same number multiple times to fully remove the condition.
            If a location on the condition track becomes empty, all of the conditions to the right of that location shift down by 1.
            This means the highest number on the condition track should always match the number of unique conditions the monster has.
            The oldest condition should always be number 1, and the most recent condition should have the highest number on the track.

        \subsection{Monster Resources}
            Unless otherwise noted in their description, monsters have no resources, and their fatigue tolerance is treated as 0.
            They are unable to use abilities that would cause them to increase their fatigue level, such as the \textit{desperate exertion} ability.
            They can use the \ability{sprint} ability, but only during the \glossterm{action phase}, since that does not increase their fatigue.

            At the GM's discretion, individual monsters may technically be attuned to their abilities or be attuned to magic items they find, but this is not an explicit part of monster definitions.
            Similarly, monsters that are allied with player characters may choose to increase their fatigue level to receive healing from the players, such as from the \spell{restoration} spell.
            Since they do not have a fatigue tolerance, this would immediately cause them to suffer fatigue penalties.

        \subsection{Monster Ability Access}\label{Monster Ability Access}
            Although monsters do not gain archetypes, their special abilities should still be balanced appropriately for their maximum accessible rank.
            Like a player character, a monster's maximum accessible rank is based on its level, as shown in \tref{Monster Advancement}.

            It's not always meaningful to give every monster multiple active abilities.
            However, maneuvers provide significant power at high levels, so high level monsters should generally use special abilities like maneuvers instead of simple strikes.
            This also ensures that high level monsters feel meaningfully different from low-level monsters, rather than simply having higher statistics.

    \subsection{Monster Attributes}\label{Monster Attributes}
        Each of a standard monster's attributes can range from \minus9 to 4.
        Elite monsters can have attributes up to 6, and they generally have higher attributes overall.
        A few specific monsters of legendary power can exceed this limit.
        In general, a monster with higher attributes will be stronger, but not all monsters need to start with the same attribute total.

    \subsection{Monster Natural Weapons}\label{Monster Natural Weapon}
        Most monsters that do not have hands, or equivalently agile limbs capable of holding weapons and shields, have more powerful natural weapons.
        They treat all non-\weapontag{Light} natural weapons as if they had the \weapontag{Versatile Grip} weapon tag and were being held in two hands.
        This gives them a \plus1d damage bonus plus \plus1d per 3 \glossterm{power}.

        Natural weapons that do not require free hands are generally weaker than other weapons, and monsters need this benefit to compensate for their inability to use weapons or shields.
        Some specific monsters, like horses, do not gain this benefit because they are unable to effectively use their whole body to support their attacks.

    \subsection{Monster Dual Wielding}\label{Monster Dual Wielding}
        Monsters with a sufficiently high Dexterity are able to dual wield (see \pcref{Dual Wielding}).
        However, most monsters can only \glossterm{dual wield} with two copies of the same \weapontag{Light} natural weapon.
        Monsters that use \glossterm{manufactured weapons} can dual wield with them in the same way as player characters.

\section{Monster Combat Mechanics}

    \subsection{Monster Actions}\label{Monster Actions}
        All monsters are able to make movements and take free actions, minor actions, and standard actions in the same way as player characters.
        Elite monsters can take an additional \glossterm{elite action} each round.

        \subsubsection{Elite Actions}\label{Elite Actions}
            Every elite monster has at least one special ability which requires an elite action to use.
            Elite actions cannot be converted into standard or minor actions, and elite monsters cannot use a standard action to use abilities that require an elite action.
            Abilities that require elite actions are typically more powerful than normal combat abilities, and they can have unique effects.

            In general, elite monsters should be designed to attack multiple different PCs in every round.
            If the full damage output of an elite monster is brought to bear on a single PC, it will likely kill that PC quickly, taking a player out of the fight too early.
            Alternately, if that PC is able to avoid or resist the damage, it will trivialize the fight and remove the sense of danger.
            Instead, damage should be spread throughout the party to ensure that multiple people feel threatened and have to adjust their actions based on their personal danger tolerance.

            Although splitting attacks between multiple defenders is usually a suboptimal battle strategy, it can be narratively justified in a variety of ways.
            It may be physically impractical for a monster to use all of its natural weapons on the same creature.
            Monsters may want to inflict debuffs on multiple attackers to reduce the damage they take, which may require dealing enough damage to inflict HP-based debuffs.

    \subsection{Encounter Balancing}\label{Encounter Balancing}
        In general, a group of PCs of a given level will have an appropriate challenge from fighting an equal number of monsters of their level.
        Alternately, they can fight a single elite monster of their level.
        You can generally replace one monster of a given level with two monsters that are two or three levels lower.
        Similarly, you can replace two monsters of a given level with one monster that is two or three levels higher.
        To make encounters easier or harder, you can change the number of monsters or the level of the monsters.

        It is generally not a good idea for PCs to fight monsters five or more levels higher or lower than their own level.
        They may find that their attacks always miss, or never miss, and other aspects of the encounter may be similarly imbalanced in ways that are not easily remedied by simply changing the number of enemies.

        There are many ways that you can make encounters easier or harder in ways that don't simply involve changing the level and number of monsters.
        If monsters enter the battle gradually over time, rather than all at once, you can use a larger number of monsters without overwhelming the players.
        Similarly, having multiple separate fights without letting the players finish a \glossterm{short rest} can dramatically increase the danger and difficulty of the later fights.

        The terrain and physical location of a fight can also dramatically change its difficulty.
        Narrow corridors and tight spaces favor smaller groups, highly defensive characters, and mid-range spellcasters who can attack safely from the back lines.
        Wide-open terrain favors large groups, highly mobile creatures, and long-range combatants like archers.
        A party with good tactics can easily hold a five-foot tunnel against dozens or even hundreds of melee-only enemy combatants, even if they would be swarmed and killed easily by those same enemies in an open field.

    \subsection{Monster Knowledge}
        You can remember relevant knowledge about monsters by making Knowledge skill checks.
        Each monster has a set of associated information that you can learn with a knowledge check of the listed difficulty value.
        Most monsters have multiple tiers of information that you can learn depending on how good your Knowledge check is.
        All information recorded in these descriptions is accurate, though lower check results may not provide full context for a monster's behavior or nature.

\section{Quick Monster Creation}

    This table describes the statistics for a non-elite monster with 0 in all attributes, other than the monster's bonus attribute from its role.
    It can be a useful reference to when creating custom monsters at a particular role and level.
    The format is extremely terse to save space: ``HP/DR; Armor/Fort/Ref/Ment''.
