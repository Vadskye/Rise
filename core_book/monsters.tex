\chapter{Monsters}

Monsters are all of the various non-humanoid creatures that exist in the world of Rise.
Many of them are dangerous, and adventurers may need to fight them.
This chapter describes the rules for monsters, and the combat statistics for a variety of monsters.

\section{Monster Statistics}
    Like player characters, monsters have levels, attributes, and abilities.
    However, they do not have classes, legacy items, or many other elements of characters.
    This section defines how monsters function.

    \subsection{Level}
        Each monster has a level that indicates its approximate strength.
        This has all of the same effects as the level for a player character, except that monsters do not gain legacy items or attunement points as described in \tref{Character Advancement}.

    \subsection{Challenge Rating}\label{Challenge Rating}
        Each monster has a \glossterm{challenge rating} that indicates its approximate strength within its level, ranging from 1/2 to 4.
        A monster's challenge rating is a guideline to how many of that monster should typically be present in an encounter (see \pcref{Encounter Balancing}).
        This has several effects on the monster's statistics, as decribed in \trefnp{Challenge Rating Effects}.

        \begin{dtable}
            \lcaption{Challenge Rating Effects}
            \begin{dtabularx}{\textwidth}{l l l X l l l}
                \tb{CR} & \tb{HP}  & \tb{DR} & \tb{AP} & \tb{Accuracy} & \tb{Defenses} & \tb{Damage}\fn{1} \tableheaderrule
                1/2     & \mult1/2 & \mult0  & 0       & \plus0        & \plus0        & \minus2d \\
                1       & \mult1   & \mult0  & 1       & \plus0        & \plus0        & \minus1d \\
                2       & \mult1   & \mult1  & 1       & \plus1        & \plus1        & \tdash   \\
                3       & \mult2   & \mult2  & 2       & \plus2        & \plus2        & \tdash  \\
                4       & \mult3   & \mult4  & 3       & \plus3        & \plus3        & \plus1d  \\
            \end{dtabularx}
            1. This modifier applies to all damage dice rolled by the monster, including both strikes and magical abilities. \\
        \end{dtable}

        \subsubsection{Monster Vital Wounds}
            Monsters do not normally make \glossterm{vital rolls} like player characters do.
            Unless otherwise specified on the monster's description, \glossterm{vital wounds} have no negative effects on monsters.
            Instead, once a monster gains a \glossterm{vital wound}, it is defeated.
            Defeated monsters may be unconscious, dead, or merely flee the fight at the discretion of the Game Master.

        \subsubsection{Monster Resources}
            Unless otherwise noted in their description, monsters have no \glossterm{resources}, and their \glossterm{fatigue tolerance} is treated as 0.
            They are unable to use abilities that would cause them to increase their \glossterm{fatigue level}, such as the \textit{desperate exertion} ability.

        \subsubsection{Recovering Conditions}
            Monsters cannot normally use the \textit{recover} ability.
            However, monsters with a high challenge rating can remove conditions automatically.
            At the end of each round, monsters with CR of 2 or higher roll 1d10 \add their CR.
            Monsters gain a \plus1 bonus to this roll at 6th level and every 6 levels thereafter.
            If the result is 10 or higher, the monster removes one condition of its choice.
            This effect cannot remove a condition applied during the current round.
            Monsters without a sufficient understanding of the conditions affecting them generally choose randomly.

        \subsubsection{Rank-Based Ability Access}
            Although monsters do not gain archetypes, their special abilities should still be balanced appropriately for their maximum accessible rank.
            Like a player character, a monster's maximum accessible rank is based on its level, as shown in \tref{Monster Advancement}.
            CR 3 and CR 4 monsters gain a \plus1 bonus to their maximum rank, allowing them to use powerful abilities before players can.

    \subsection{Attributes}
        Each of a monster's base attributes can range from \minus9 to 3, as appropriate for the type of monster.
        A monster's attributes scale with level in the same way as character attributes.
        A monster can also have up to two attributes starting at 4 or 5.
        In general, a monster with higher starting attributes will be stronger, but not all monsters need to start with the same starting attribute total.

    \subsection{Level Scaling}
        Monster level scaling is described in \tref{Monster Advancement}.
        This summarizes the following effects:
        \begin{itemize}
            % this compensates for monsters not being able to take the recover action
            \item At almost all levels, the base \glossterm{hit points} of a monster are 50\% higher than the base hit points of a player character
            % this compensates for monsters not having complicated armor mechanics
            \item At all levels, the base \glossterm{damage resistance} of a monster is three times the base damage resistance of a player character
            \item Monsters gain a \plus1 bonus to all defenses at 3rd level and every 6 levels thereafter
            \item Monsters gain a \plus1 bonus to power with all abilities at 3rd level that gradually increases every 3 levels thereafter
            \item Monsters gain a \plus1d damage bonus with strikes at 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter
            \item Monsters gain a \plus1 accuracy bonus at 5th level and every 6 levels thereafter
        \end{itemize}
        These scaling values are designed to keep monsters at a similar power level to player characters without having to repetitively define specific bonuses for each monster.
        In general, monsters that are designed to have unusually high or low values for any particular statistic define that with their attributes, though some monsters have more specific abilities.

        \end{dtabularx}
        1. For each level beyond 21, a monster increases its maximum hit points by 25 and its maximum damage resistance by 12. \\
    \end{dtable*}

    \subsection{Monster Armor}
        In general, monsters gain Armor Defense bonuses ranging from \plus2 to \plus4 in the same way that player characters do.
        Of course, not all monsters wear physical armor.
        The narrative justification is that the bonus is caused by their scales, an unusually tough hide, or similar effects.

        Monster damage resistance is generally calculated more simply than player damage resistance.
        Player characters can have damage resistance bonuses from a variety of sources, especially armor.
        Since the vast majority of monsters do not wear armor, tracking their resistances explicitly with armor-equivalent mechanics would just be unnecessary bookkeeping.
        Instead, monsters have twice the normal base value for their damage resistance, and high CR monsters have additional multipliers on top of that.

    \subsection{Monster Natural Weapon Bonuses}
        Monsters do not use the \textit{offhand strike} ability in combat.
        In general, rolling offhand strikes for each monster in a combat isn't worth the time and effort.
        Instead, if a monster has two copies of the same light natural weapon and the free hands to use both, it gains a \plus1 accuracy bonus with that natural weapon.

        In addition, monsters that do not use hands for any purpose gain a \plus1d damage bonus with all strikes.
        The base statistics for natural weapons that do not require free hands, like bite and gore, are balanced for player usage.
        Being able to attack while both of your hands are occupied is powerful.
        However, monsters that do not take advantage of that opportunity need increased damage to keep pace with other attack options.

\section{Monster Combat Mechanics}

    \subsection{Monster Actions}
        All monsters are able to take \glossterm{free actions}.
        CR 1 or higher monsters can take \glossterm{minor actions}, though many monsters do not have any relevant minor actions to take.
        Some monsters, including many high CR monsters, can either take additional actions each round or use powerful abilities as minor actions.
        These special abilities are listed in their descriptions.

        In general, all monsters of CR 3 or 4 should be designed to attack multiple different PCs in every round.
        If the full damage output of a high-CR monster is brought to bear on a single PC, it will likely kill that PC quickly, taking a player out of the fight too early.
        Alternately, if that PC is able to avoid or resist the damage, it will trivialize the fight and remove the sense of danger.
        Instead, damage should be spread throughout the party to ensure that multiple people feel threatened and have to adjust their actions based on their personal danger tolerance.

    \subsection{Encounter Balancing}\label{Encounter Balancing}
        In general, a group of PCs of a given level will have an appropriate challenge from fighting monsters of the same level with a combined challenge rating equal to the number of PCs.
        Fighting monsters of a lower level, or monsters whose combined challenge rating is less than the number of PCs, will yield an easier encounter.
        Fighting monsters of a higher level, or fighting monsters whose combined challenge rating is greater than the number of PCs, will yield a more difficult encounter.

        It is generally not a good idea for PCs to fight monsters more than three levels higher or lower than their own.
        They may find that their attacks always miss, or never miss, and other aspects of the encounter may be similarly imbalanced in ways that are not easily remedied by simply changing the number of enemies.

        However, intentionally using lower-level monsters with a high CR can change the tone of an encounter in ways that may be beneficial.
        A fight against four CR 1 monsters of your level has a different pace and tone than a fight against four CR 2 monsters that are two or three levels lower than you, but both encounters can be similarly challenging.

    \subsection{Monster Knowledge}
        You can remember relevant knowledge about monsters by making Knowledge checks (see \pcref{Knowledge}).
        Each monster has a set of associated information that you can learn with a knowledge check of the listed \glossterm{difficulty rating}.
        Most monsters have multiple tiers of information that you can learn depending on how good your Knowledge check is.
        All information recorded in these descriptions is accurate, though lower check results may not provide full context for a monster's behavior or nature.
