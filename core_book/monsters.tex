\chapter{Monsters}

Monsters are all of the various non-humanoid creatures that exist in the world of Rise.
Many of them are dangerous, and adventurers may need to fight them.
This chapter describes the rules for monsters, and the combat statistics for a variety of monsters.

\section{Monster Statistics}
    Like player characters, monsters have levels, attributes, and abilities.
    However, they do not have classes, legacy items, or many other elements of characters.
    This section defines how monsters function.

    \subsection{Level Scaling}
        Each monster has a level that indicates its approximate strength.
        Monsters have some specific level scaling rules that differ from the rules for player characters.
        In general, their automatic level scaling is designed to keep them on par with the power that player characters gain at higher levels, but without all of the complexity of high-level PCs.
        High level monsters should have slightly higher base values for their attributes, though this is not quantified, since monster attributes can be highly varied.
        They have the following specific changes.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Monsters have twice the base damage resistance of a player character
            \item Monsters gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{power} with all abilities at 3rd level and 12th level
            \item Monsters gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} at 9th level and 18th level
        \end{itemize}

        Monster level scaling is summarized in \tref{Monster Advancement}.
        Monsters gain the same statistical benefits from their attributes that player characters do.
        The values listed in the Monster Advancement table do not include bonuses from attributes.
        When creating a new monster, make sure to decide its attributes appropriately, since they can have a large effect on the monster's overall power level and combat style.
        In particular, variable attributes make monster defenses more varied.

    \subsection{Elite Monsters}\label{Elite Monsters}
        Elite monsters are approximately four times as strong as an ordinary monster.
        They have a number of benefits and modifiers to make them more appropriate as a solo encounter than simply using a very high level ordinary monster:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Elite monsters gain a \plus2 bonus to their \glossterm{accuracy} and all \glossterm{defenses}.
            \item Elite monsters have four times the \glossterm{hit points} and \glossterm{damage resistance} of standard monsters.
            \item Elite monsters can have a maximum attribute of 6 (see \pcref{Monster Attributes}).
            \item Elite monsters double their damage and healing with all abilities. This is separate from any other multipliers, so an elite monster using a double damage attack would deal four times the damage of a normal monster's attack.
            \item Elite monsters can take an additional \glossterm{elite action} each round (see \pcref{Elite Actions}).
            \item Elite monsters automatically remove excess \glossterm{conditions} (see \pcref{Conditions on Monsters}).
        \end{itemize}

        \subsection{Monster Vital Wounds}
            Monsters do not normally make vital rolls like player characters do.
            Unless otherwise specified on the monster's description, vital wounds have no negative effects on monsters.
            Instead, once a monster gains a vital wound, it is defeated.
            Defeated monsters may be unconscious, dead, or merely flee the fight at the discretion of the Game Master.

        \subsection{Conditions on Monsters}\label{Conditions on Monsters}
            Monsters normally can't use the \textit{recover} ability, since they cannot use abilities which would give them \glossterm{fatigue}.
            Standard monsters can only remove \glossterm{conditions} by taking a \glossterm{short rest}.

            However, elite monsters can remove conditions automatically.
            At the end of each round, elite monsters affected by four or more conditions automatically remove their oldest \glossterm{condition}.
            In addition, some elite monsters have unique abilities to remove conditions, as indicated in their descriptions.

        \subsection{Monster Resources}
            Unless otherwise noted in their description, monsters have no resources, and their fatigue tolerance is treated as 0.
            They are unable to use abilities that would cause them to increase their fatigue level, such as the \textit{desperate exertion} ability.
            They can use the \ability{sprint} ability, but only during the \glossterm{action phase}, since that does not increase their fatigue.
            At the GM's discretion, individual monsters may technically be attuned to their abilities or be attuned to magic items they find, but this is not an explicit part of monster definitions.

        \subsection{Monster Ability Access}\label{Monster Ability Access}
            Although monsters do not gain archetypes, their special abilities should still be balanced appropriately for their maximum accessible rank.
            Like a player character, a monster's maximum accessible rank is based on its level, as shown in \tref{Monster Advancement}.

            It's not always meaningful to give every monster multiple active abilities.
            However, maneuvers provide significant power at high levels, so high level monsters should generally use special abilities like maneuvers instead of simple strikes.
            This also ensures that high level monsters feel meaningfully different from low-level monsters, rather than simply having higher statistics.

    \subsection{Monster Attributes}\label{Monster Attributes}
        Each of a standard monster's attributes can range from \minus9 to 4.
        Elite monsters can have attributes up to 6, and they generally have higher attributes overall.
        A few specific monsters of legendary power can exceed this limit.
        In general, a monster with higher attributes will be stronger, but not all monsters need to start with the same attribute total.

    \subsection{Monster Dual Wielding}\label{Monster Dual Wielding}
        Monsters with a sufficiently high Dexterity are able to dual wield (see \pcref{Dual Wielding}).
        However, most monsters can only \glossterm{dual wield} with two copies of the same \weapontag{Light} natural weapon.
        Monsters that use \glossterm{manufactured weapons} can dual wield with them in the same way as player characters.

\section{Monster Combat Mechanics}

    \subsection{Monster Actions}\label{Monster Actions}
        All monsters are able to make movements and take free actions, minor actions, and standard actions in the same way as player characters.
        Elite monsters can take an additional \glossterm{elite action} each round.

        \subsubsection{Elite Actions}\label{Elite Actions}
            Every elite monster has at least one special ability which requires an elite action to use.
            Elite actions cannot be converted into standard or minor actions, and elite monsters cannot use a standard action to use abilities that require an elite action.
            Abilities that require elite actions are typically more powerful than normal combat abilities, and they can have unique effects.

            In general, elite monsters should be designed to attack multiple different PCs in every round.
            If the full damage output of an elite monster is brought to bear on a single PC, it will likely kill that PC quickly, taking a player out of the fight too early.
            Alternately, if that PC is able to avoid or resist the damage, it will trivialize the fight and remove the sense of danger.
            Instead, damage should be spread throughout the party to ensure that multiple people feel threatened and have to adjust their actions based on their personal danger tolerance.

            Although splitting attacks between multiple defenders is usually a suboptimal battle strategy, it can be narratively justified in a variety of ways.
            It may be physically impractical for a monster to use all of its natural weapons on the same creature.
            Monsters may want to inflict debuffs on multiple attackers to reduce the damage they take, which may require dealing enough damage to inflict HP-based debuffs.

    \subsection{Encounter Balancing}\label{Encounter Balancing}
        In general, a group of PCs of a given level will have an appropriate challenge from fighting an equal number of monsters of their level.
        Alternately, they can fight a single elite monster of their level.
        You can generally replace one monster of a given level with two monsters that are two or three levels lower.
        Similarly, you can replace two monsters of a given level with one monster that is two or three levels higher.
        To make encounters easier or harder, you can change the number of monsters or the level of the monsters.

        It is generally not a good idea for PCs to fight monsters five or more levels higher or lower than their own level.
        They may find that their attacks always miss, or never miss, and other aspects of the encounter may be similarly imbalanced in ways that are not easily remedied by simply changing the number of enemies.

        There are many ways that you can make encounters easier or harder in ways that don't simply involve changing the level and number of monsters.
        If monsters enter the battle gradually over time, rather than all at once, you can use a larger number of monsters without overwhelming the players.
        Similarly, having multiple separate fights without letting the players finish a \glossterm{short rest} can dramatically increase the danger and difficulty of the later fights.

        The terrain and physical location of a fight can also dramatically change its difficulty.
        Narrow corridors and tight spaces favor smaller groups, highly defensive characters, and mid-range spellcasters who can attack safely from the back lines.
        Wide-open terrain favors large groups, highly mobile creatures, and long-range combatants like archers.
        A party with good tactics can easily hold a five-foot tunnel against dozens or even hundreds of melee-only enemy combatants, even if they would be swarmed and killed easily by those same enemies in an open field.

    \subsection{Monster Knowledge}
        You can remember relevant knowledge about monsters by making Knowledge skill checks.
        Each monster has a set of associated information that you can learn with a knowledge check of the listed difficulty value.
        Most monsters have multiple tiers of information that you can learn depending on how good your Knowledge check is.
        All information recorded in these descriptions is accurate, though lower check results may not provide full context for a monster's behavior or nature.
