\chapter{Monsters}

Monsters are all of the various non-humanoid creatures that exist in the world of Rise.
Many of them are dangerous, and adventurers may need to fight them.
This chapter describes the rules for monsters, and the combat statistics for a variety of monsters.

\section{Monster Statistics}
    Like player characters, monsters have levels, attributes, and abilities.
    However, they do not have classes, legacy items, or many other elements of characters.
    This section defines how monsters function.

    \subsection{Level Scaling}
        Each monster has a level that indicates its approximate strength.
        Monsters have some specific level scaling rules that differ from the rules for player characters.
        In general, their automatic level scaling is designed to keep them on par with the power that player characters gain at higher levels, but without all of the complexity of high-level PCs.
        High level monsters should have slightly higher base values for their attributes, though this is not quantified, since monster attributes can be highly varied.
        They have the following specific benefits.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Monsters use the same hit points and damage resistance rules as player characters (see \pcref{Hit Points and Damage Resistance})
            \item Monsters gain a \plus1 bonus to all defenses at 3rd level, 12th level, and 21st level
            \item Monsters gain a \plus1d damage bonus with strikes at 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter
            \item Monsters gain a \plus1 bonus to power with all abilities that gradually increases at 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter, as described in \tref{Monster Advancement}
            \item Monsters gain a \plus1 bonus to their roll to automatically remove conditions at 6th level and 15th level
            \item Monsters gain a \plus1 accuracy bonus at 19th level
        \end{itemize}

        Monster level scaling is summarized in \tref{Monster Advancement}.
        The values in that table are accurate for CR 1 monsters, since they are individually the most similar to player characters and have the fewest multipliers and modifiers.
        The statistics for monsters with a different CR can be extrapolated from those base values.

        Monsters gain the same statistical benefits from their attributes that player characters do.
        The values listed in the Monster Advancement table do not include bonuses from attributes.
        When creating a new monster, make sure to decide its attributes appropriately, since they can have a large effect on the monster's overall power level and combat style.
        In particular, attributes make monster defenses more varied.

        The Monster Advancement table includes a Bite Damage column for convenient reference.
        The monster bonus damage with strikes applies to all natural weapons, not just strikes.
        However, bites are one of the most common monster natural weapons, and it's much more convenient to see a die value rather than a large +d value at high levels.
        The damage value for other natural weapons, such as claws, can be derived from the bite damage listed.

        1. The statistics in this table are accurate for CR 1 monsters. \\
        2. Assuming the monster has no free hands (see \pcref{Monster Natural Weapon Bonuses}). \\
        % 3. For each level beyond 21, a monster increases its maximum hit points by 25 and its maximum damage resistance by 12. \\
    \end{dtable}

    \subsection{Challenge Rating}\label{Challenge Rating}
        Each monster has a \glossterm{challenge rating} that indicates its approximate strength within its level, ranging from 1/2 to 6.
        A monster's challenge rating is a guideline to how many of that monster should typically be present in an encounter (see \pcref{Encounter Balancing}).
        This has several effects on the monster's statistics, as described in \trefnp{Challenge Rating Effects}.

        \begin{dtable*}
            \lcaption{Challenge Rating Effects}
            \begin{dtabularx}{\textwidth}{l l l l l X X l}
                \tb{CR} & \tb{HP} & \tb{DR} & \tb{Accuracy} & \tb{Defenses} & \tb{Power Scaling}\fn{1} & \tb{Max Attribute} & \tb{Max Rank}\fn{2} \tableheaderrule
                1/2     & \mult1  & \mult0  & \plus0        & \minus1       & \mult1/2                 & 3                  & \minus1 \\
                1       & \mult1  & \mult3  & \plus0        & \plus0        & \mult1                   & 3                  & \tdash  \\
                2       & \mult2  & \mult6  & \plus1        & \plus0        & \mult2                   & 4                  & \tdash  \\
                4       & \mult4  & \mult10 & \plus1        & \plus1        & \mult3                   & 6                  & \tdash  \\
                6       & \mult6  & \mult15 & \plus1        & \plus2        & \mult4                   & 7                  & \plus1  \\
            \end{dtabularx}
            1. This modifier applies to the special power bonus that monsters get based on their level, not to any other sources of power such as Strength or Willpower. \\
            2. See \pcref{Rank-Based Ability Access}. \\
        \end{dtable*}

        \subsubsection{Monster Vital Wounds}
            Monsters do not normally make \glossterm{vital rolls} like player characters do.
            Unless otherwise specified on the monster's description, \glossterm{vital wounds} have no negative effects on monsters.
            Instead, once a monster gains a \glossterm{vital wound}, it is defeated.
            Defeated monsters may be unconscious, dead, or merely flee the fight at the discretion of the Game Master.

        \subsubsection{Monster Resources}
            Unless otherwise noted in their description, monsters have no \glossterm{resources}, and their \glossterm{fatigue tolerance} is treated as 0.
            They are unable to use abilities that would cause them to increase their \glossterm{fatigue level}, such as the \textit{desperate exertion} ability.

        \subsubsection{Recovering Conditions}
            Monsters cannot normally use the \textit{recover} ability.
            However, monsters with a high challenge rating can remove conditions automatically.
            At the end of each round, monsters with CR of 2 or higher roll 1d10 \add their CR.
            If the result is 11 or higher, the monster removes one condition of its choice.
            For every 5 points by which it exceeds that result, it removes an additional condition.
            This effect cannot remove a condition applied during the current round.
            Monsters without a sufficient understanding of the conditions affecting them generally choose randomly.

        \subsubsection{Rank-Based Ability Access}
            Although monsters do not gain archetypes, their special abilities should still be balanced appropriately for their maximum accessible rank.
            Like a player character, a monster's maximum accessible rank is based on its level, as shown in \tref{Monster Advancement}.
            CR 1/2 monsters take a \minus1 penalty to their maximum rank, and generally do not have particularly powerful or complex special abilities.
            CR 6 monsters gain a \plus1 bonus to their maximum rank, allowing them to use powerful abilities before player characters can.

    \subsection{Attributes}
        Each of a monster's base attributes can range from \minus9 to whatever the maximum base attribute is for a monster of its CR.
        A monster's total attributes scale with level in the same way as player character attributes.
        In general, a monster with higher base attributes will be stronger, but not all monsters need to start with the same base attribute total.

    \subsection{Monster Natural Weapon Bonuses}\label{Monster Natural Weapon Bonuses}
        Monsters do not use the \textit{offhand strike} ability in combat.
        In general, rolling offhand strikes for each monster in a combat isn't worth the time and effort.
        Instead, if a monster has two copies of the same light natural weapon and the physical ability to use both simultaneously, it gains a \plus1 accuracy bonus with that natural weapon.

        In addition, monsters that do not use hands for any purpose gain a \plus1d damage bonus with all strikes.
        The base statistics for natural weapons that do not require free hands, like bite and gore, are balanced for player usage.
        Being able to attack while both of your hands are occupied is powerful.
        However, monsters that do not take advantage of that opportunity need increased damage to keep pace with other attack options.

    \subsection{Monster Natural Armor}\label{Monster Natural Armor}
        Monsters use slightly different armor mechanics than player characters.
        They always add half their base Dexterity to their Armor defense instead of their full base Dexterity, as if they were wearing medium armor.
        In addition, they gain a bonus equal to half their base Constitution to their Armor defense.
        This represents hardened skin, tough scales, or similar natural armor that monsters can develop.

\section{Monster Combat Mechanics}

    \subsection{Monster Actions}
        All monsters are able to take \glossterm{free actions}.
        CR 2 or higher monsters can take \glossterm{minor actions}, though most monsters do not have any relevant minor actions to take.
        All CR 4 monsters can take an additional standard action each round, and CR 6 monsters can take two additional standard actions each round.
        These special abilities are listed in their descriptions.

        In general, all monsters of CR 4 or 6 should be designed to attack multiple different PCs in every round.
        If the full damage output of a high-CR monster is brought to bear on a single PC, it will likely kill that PC quickly, taking a player out of the fight too early.
        Alternately, if that PC is able to avoid or resist the damage, it will trivialize the fight and remove the sense of danger.
        Instead, damage should be spread throughout the party to ensure that multiple people feel threatened and have to adjust their actions based on their personal danger tolerance.

        Although splitting attacks between multiple defenders is usually a suboptimal battle strategy, it can be narratively justified in a variety of ways.
        It may be physically impractical for a monster to use all of its natural weapons on the same creature.
        Monsters may want to inflict debuffs on multiple attackers to reduce the damage they take, which may require dealing enough damage to inflict HP-based debuffs.

    \subsection{Encounter Balancing}\label{Encounter Balancing}
        In general, a group of PCs of a given level will have an appropriate challenge from fighting monsters of the same level with a combined challenge rating equal to the number of PCs.
        Fighting monsters of a lower level, or monsters whose combined challenge rating is less than the number of PCs, will yield an easier encounter.
        Fighting monsters of a higher level, or fighting monsters whose combined challenge rating is greater than the number of PCs, will yield a more difficult encounter.

        It is generally not a good idea for PCs to fight monsters more than four levels higher or lower than their own level.
        They may find that their attacks always miss, or never miss, and other aspects of the encounter may be similarly imbalanced in ways that are not easily remedied by simply changing the number of enemies.

        However, intentionally using lower-level monsters with a high CR can change the tone of an encounter in ways that may be beneficial.
        A fight against four CR 1 monsters of the partys' level has a different pace and tone than a fight against four CR 2 monsters that are two or three levels lower than the party, but both encounters can be similarly challenging.

    \subsection{Monster Knowledge}
        You can remember relevant knowledge about monsters by making Knowledge checks (see \pcref{Knowledge}).
        Each monster has a set of associated information that you can learn with a knowledge check of the listed \glossterm{difficulty value}.
        Most monsters have multiple tiers of information that you can learn depending on how good your Knowledge check is.
        All information recorded in these descriptions is accurate, though lower check results may not provide full context for a monster's behavior or nature.
