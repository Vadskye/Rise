\chapter{Monsters}

Monsters are all of the various non-humanoid creatures that exist in the world of Rise.
Many of them are dangerous, and adventurers may need to fight them.
This chapter describes the rules for monsters, and the combat statistics for a variety of monsters.

\section{Monster Statistics}
    Like player characters, monsters have levels, attributes, and abilities.
    However, they do not have classes, legacy items, or many other elements of characters.
    This section defines how monsters function.

    \subsection{Level}
        Each monster has a level that indicates its approximate strength.
        This has all of the same effects as the level for a player character, except that monsters do not gain legacy items or attunement points as described in \tref{Character Advancement}.

    \subsection{Challenge Rating}\label{Challenge Rating}
        Each monster has a \glossterm{challenge rating} that indicates its approximate strength within its level, ranging from 1/2 to 4.
        A monster's challenge rating is a guideline to how many of that monster should typically be present in an encounter (see \pcref{Encounter Balancing}).
        This has several effects on the monster's statistics, as decribed in \trefnp{Challenge Rating Effects}.

        \begin{dtable}
            \lcaption{Challenge Rating Effects}
            \begin{dtabularx}{\textwidth}{l l l X l l l}
                \tb{CR} & \tb{HP}  & \tb{Resists} & \tb{AP} & \tb{Accuracy} & \tb{Defenses} & \tb{Damage}\fn{1} \tableheaderrule
                1/2     & \mult1/2 & \mult0           & 0       & \plus0        & \plus0 & \minus1d \\
                1       & \mult1   & \mult0           & 1       & \plus0        & \plus0 & \tdash \\
                2       & \mult1   & \mult1           & 1       & \plus1        & \plus1 & \tdash \\
                3       & \mult2   & \mult2           & 2       & \plus2        & \plus2 & \plus1d \\
                4       & \mult4   & \mult2\fn{2}     & 3       & \plus3        & \plus3 & \plus1d \\
            \end{dtabularx}
            1. This modifier applies to all damage dice rolled by the monster, including both strikes and magical abilities. \\
            2. CR 4 monsters also have a universal damage resistance equal to half their HP (see \pcref{Monster Universal Resistance}). \\
        \end{dtable}

        \subsection{Monster Universal Resistance}\label{Monster Universal Resistance}
            CR 4 monsters have a special \glossterm{universal resistance} to damage of all types equal to half their maximum \glossterm{hit points} (after taking into account their hit point multiplier).
            This resistance is independent of their specific resistances to physical damage or energy damage, and is applied after their more specific resistances have been expended.
            A small number of monsters that are not CR 4 can also gain universal damage resistance as indicated in their descriptions.

            This resistance ensures that CR 4 monsters are appropriately durable in combat without requiring all damage they take be of any particular type.
            It should take multiple rounds of combat before they start losing hit points, since losing hit points makes them vulnerable to powerful detrimental effects.
            CR 4 monsters also have a high hit point total to encourage the use of those powerful debuffs against them.

        \subsubsection{Monster Vital Wounds}
            Monsters do not normally make \glossterm{vital rolls} like player characters do.
            Instead, once a monster gains a \glossterm{vital wound}, it is defeated.
            Defeated monsters may be unconscious, dead, or merely flee the fight at the discretion of the Game Master.

            Some monsters have specific mechanics for what happens if they gain \glossterm{vital wounds}.
            Unless otherwise specified on the monster's description, \glossterm{vital wounds} have no negative effects on monsters.

        \subsubsection{Spending Resources}
            Unless otherwise noted in their description, all monsters are unable to use abilities that would cause them to increase their \glossterm{fatigue level}, such as the \textit{desperate exertion} ability.

        \subsubsection{Recovering Hit Points and Conditions}
            Monsters cannot normally use the \textit{recover} ability.
            However, monsters with a high challenge rating can remove conditions automatically.
            At the end of each round, monsters with CR of 1 or higher roll 1d10 \add their CR.
            If the result is 11 or higher, the monster removes one condition of its choice.
            This effect cannot remove a condition applied during the current round.
            Monsters without a sufficient understanding of the conditions affecting them generally choose randomly.

    \subsection{Attributes}
        Each of a monster's base attributes can range from \minus9 to 3, as appropriate for the type of monster.
        A monster's attributes scale with level in the same way as character attributes.
        A monster can also have up to two attributes starting at 4 or 5.
        In general, a monster with higher starting attributes will be stronger, but not all monsters need to start with the same starting attribute total.

    \subsection{Level Scaling}
        Monster level scaling is described in \tref{Monster Advancement}.
        This summarizes the following effects:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A \plus1 bonus to all defenses at 3rd level and every 6 levels thereafter
            \item A \plus1 bonus to power with all abilities at 3rd level that gradually increases every 3 levels thereafter
            \item A \plus1d damage bonus with strikes at 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter
            \item A \plus1 bonus to level for the purpose of determining \glossterm{hit points} at 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter.
            \item A \plus1 accuracy bonus at 5th level and every 6 levels thereafter
        \end{itemize}
        These scaling values are designed to keep monsters at a similar power level to player characters without having to repetitively define specific bonuses for each monster.
        In general, monsters that are designed to have unusually high or low values for any particular statistic define that with their attributes, though some monsters have more specific abilities.

            19th       & 88        & 22               & \plus3        & \plus8     & \plus6d            & \plus3 \\

        \end{dtabularx}
        1. For each level beyond 21, a monster increases its maximum hit points by 30 and its maximum resistances by 4. \\
    \end{dtable*}

    \subsection{Monster Armor}
        In general, monsters gain Armor Defense bonuses ranging from \plus2 to \plus4 in the same way that player characters do.
        Of course, not all monsters wear physical armor.
        The narrative justification is that the bonus is caused by their scales, an unusually tough hide, or similar effects.

        Monster resistances are generally calculated more simply than player resistances from armor, however.
        At higher levels, player resistances are heavily influenced by special materials, and calculating monster resistances in the same way would require annoying bookkeeping and lead to oddly large gaps between resistances at similar levels.
        Instead, many monsters have special abilities indicating that they double their base resistance bonus for physical damage, energy damage, or both, depending on the monster's narrative.
        This should generally result in monsters that have highly mismatched resistances, such as high physical resistance and low energy resistance, instead of creating monsters with balanced resistances.
        Imbalanced monster resistances give player characters more opportunity to meaningfully change their actions based on monster resistances, and encourages PCs to switch between energy damage and physical damage where possible.

    \subsection{Monster Natural Weapon Bonuses}
        Monsters do not use the \textit{offhand strike} ability in combat.
        In general, rolling offhand strikes for each monster in a combat isn't worth the time and effort.
        Instead, if a monster has two copies of the same light natural weapon and the free hands to use both, it gains a \plus2 accuracy bonus with that natural weapon.

        In addition, monsters that do not use hands for any purpose gain a \plus1d damage bonus with all strikes.
        The base statistics for natural weapons that do not require free hands, like bite and gore, are balanced for player usage.
        Being able to attack while both of your hands are occupied is powerful.
        However, monsters that do not take advantage of that opportunity need increased damage to keep pace with other attack options.

\section{Monster Combat Mechanics}

    \subsection{Monster Actions}
        All monsters are able to take \glossterm{free actions}.
        CR 1 or higher monsters can take \glossterm{minor actions}, though many monsters do not have any relevant minor actions to take.
        Some monsters, including many high CR monsters, can either take additional actions each round or use powerful abilities as minor actions.
        These special abilities are listed in their descriptions.

        In general, all monsters of CR 3 or 4 should be designed to attack multiple different PCs in every round.
        If the full damage output of a high-CR monster is brought to bear on a single PC, it will likely kill that PC quickly, taking a player out of the fight too early.
        Alternately, if that PC is able to avoid or resist the damage, it will trivialize the fight and remove the sense of danger.
        Instead, damage should be spread throughout the party to ensure that multiple people feel threatened and have to adjust their actions based on their personal danger tolerance.

    \subsection{Encounter Balancing}\label{Encounter Balancing}
        In general, a group of PCs of a given level will have an appropriate challenge from fighting monsters of the same level with a combined challenge rating equal to the number of PCs.
        Fighting monsters of a lower level, or monsters whose combined challenge rating is less than the number of PCs, will yield an easier encounter.
        Fighting monsters of a higher level, or fighting monsters whose combined challenge rating is greater than the number of PCs, will yield a more difficult encounter.

        It is generally not a good idea for PCs to fight monsters more than three levels higher or lower than their own.
        They may find that their attacks always miss, or never miss, and other aspects of the encounter may be similarly imbalanced in ways that are not easily remedied by simply changing the number of enemies.

        However, intentionally using lower-level monsters with a high CR can change the tone of an encounter in ways that may be beneficial.
        A fight against four CR 1 monsters of your level has a different pace and tone than a fight against four CR 2 monsters that are two or three levels lower than you, but both encounters can be similarly challenging.

    \subsection{Monster Knowledge}
        You can remember relevant knowledge about monsters by making Knowledge checks (see \pcref{Knowledge}).
        Each monster has a set of associated information that you can learn with a knowledge check of the listed \glossterm{difficulty rating}.
        Most monsters have multiple tiers of information that you can learn depending on how good your Knowledge check is.
        All information recorded in these descriptions is accurate, though lower check results may not provide full context for a monster's behavior or nature.
