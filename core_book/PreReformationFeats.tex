\feat{Attribute Training}{General}
\featben You increase one of your attributes by 1, up to a maximum value equal to your level.
Other bonuses, such as racial bonuses, increase the attribute beyond your level.
\parhead{Special} This feat can be taken multiple times. Its effects stack.

\feat{Armor-Piercing Strike}{Combat, Precision}
\featpre 5th level, Perception 6, two \glossterm{strikes}.
\featben In place of two strikes, you can make a physical attack.
If you beat the target's Reflex defense, you deal damage normally.
If you also beat its Armor defense, you deal double damage.

\feat{Augment Summoning}{Magic}
\featpres \glossterm{Summoning} spell known, 2nd level spells.
\featben You gain a \plus2 bonus to spellpower with Summoning spells.


\feat{Bardic Spellpower}{Magic}
\featpre Any arcane spell known.
\featben You can treat your fighter and rogue levels as magical classes when determining your spellpower with enchantment and illusion arcane spells.


\feat{Battletrance}{Rage}
\featpres Rage ability, combat prowess 4.
\featben When you use your rage ability, you can use this feat. If you do, in place of the normal benefits and drawbacks from raging, you can use your Perception to determine your damage with light weapons.
In addition, you add your rage bonus to your Fortitude and Mental defenses.
If you do not spend a swift round each round to sustain the rage, it ends at the end of the round.
\parhead{Special} You can only gain the benefit of one Rage feat at a time.


\feat{Calculated Strike}{Combat, Precision, Strike}
\featpres Intelligence 5, combat prowess 8.
\featben In place of two strikes, you can make a physical attack.
If you hit, you deal damage normally.
If your attack result also beats the target's Fortitude defense, any damage it takes this round in excess of its hit points is dealt as critical damage.
% clarify: healing magic offsets this, as normal. ``net'' damage?

\feat{Countering Strike}{Reaction, Strike}
\featpres Intelligence 5, combat prowess 8.
\featben In place of two strikes, you can make a physical attack.
If you hit, you deal damage normally.
If the target makes a physical attack against you during the current phase, this attack deals triple damage.


In addition, you are immune to any \glossterm{Mind} effects which would cause you to take an evil action.
The effect has its normal effect on you to the extend possible, but you ignore any part of the effect which would compel or delude you into taking an evil action.
For example, you are not immune to being \glossterm{dominated}, but if a creature dominating you tries to force you to take an evil action, you do not take the action.
You would still be dominated, and the creature could still force you to take actions that are not evil.
Preventing you from taking a good action is not the same thing as forcing you to take an evil action, and this feat does not grant you any special ability to take good actions.


\feat{Chaotic Mind}{Class}
\featpres Paladin level 3, Chaos devoted alignment.
\featben You are unaffected by effects which detect truth, lies, or alignment.
Such effects never detect you, just as if you were not there at all.

\feat{Chargebreaker}{Combat, Reaction, Strike}
\featpres Dex 5, combat prowess 8.
\featben In place of two strikes, you can make a physical attack.
If you hit, you deal damage normally.
If the target moved towards you during the current round, this attack deals triple damage.


\feat{Craftcaster}{Magic}
\featpres Craft (any) 10 ranks, 2nd level spell known.
\featben When casting spells which create or transform a physical substance that you are trained to craft, you gain a \plus2 bonus to your spellpower.


\feat{Critical Rage}{Precision, Rage}
\featpres Rage ability, combat prowess 12.
\featben When you enter a rage, you can use this feat. If you do, during the rage you increase your critical range by 1.
\parhead{Special} You can only gain the benefit of one Rage feat at a time.

\feat{Delusive Guise}{Magic}
\featpre 1st level or higher \glossterm{Delusion} spell known.
\featben You gain a \plus2 bonus to Bluff and Disguise checks.
If you know a Delusion spell of 5th level or higher, this bonus increases to \plus4.

\feat{Disorienting Strike}{Combat, Strike}
\featpre Three strikes.
\featben In place of three strikes, you can make a physical attack.
If you hit, you deal damage normally.
If your attack result also beats the foe's Mental defense, it is \disoriented for 5 rounds.

\feat{Divine Health}{Class}
