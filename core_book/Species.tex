\chapter{Species}\label{Species}

Each character has a species.

\section{Species Traits}

\subsection{Species and Languages}
All characters know how to speak Common. A dwarf, elf, gnome, half-elf, half-orc, or halfling also speaks a language unique to its species, as appropriate. For each point of Intelligence a character has at 1st level, they also know one additional language of their choice. See \pcref{Linguistics}, for details about languages.

\subsection{Small Characters}\label{Small Characters}
A Small character has the following effects based on their size.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \minus2 penalty to total Strength.
    \item \minus2 penalty to \glossterm{threat}.
    \item \plus2 bonus to Reflex defense.
    \item \plus4 bonus to the Stealth skill (see \pcref{Stealth}).
\end{itemize}

In addition, a Small character generally has a move speed five feet slower than a Medium character. A Small character must also use smaller weapons than a Medium character.
