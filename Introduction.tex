\section{Why Rewrite the D20 System?}
As a DM, there were a lot of things that have frustrated me about the d20 system. The rules are too complicated at times, and not as easy to understand as I would like. Unfortunately, adding house rules that reduce complexity by removing elements of the core book actually increases the difficulty of understanding the game, because then you have to cross-reference everything from the core book with the errata to see if it changed. That's not helpful to a new player trying to figure out how all this stuff goes! The only way to make sure your introduction to the rules makes sense is to have the rules be entirely self-contained, without a separate list of additions and subtractions. That means a new core book - so here it is! Enjoy.
