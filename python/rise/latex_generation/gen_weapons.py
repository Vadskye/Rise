                This cannot remove an effect applied during the current round.
                The condition is infused into this weapon.
                You cannot use this ability while there is a condition infused in the weapon.
                However, you can release the infusion as a separate standard action.

                While this weapon is infused, if you make a creature lose \\glossterm<hit points> with it, the struck creature becomes \\glossterm<briefly> affected by the infused effect.
                This removes the infusion from this weapon, allowing you to activate it again.
