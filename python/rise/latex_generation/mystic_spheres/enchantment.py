            You can give the animal a small piece of parchment or similarly sized item containing up to 25 words.

            The animal will attempt to travel to that destination to the best of its ability, following the directions you have given it.
            It will not willingly part with its message until it reaches its destination.
            Once it reaches its destination, it will wait until it observes a valid recipient, leaving the destination only briefly as necessary to sustain itself.
