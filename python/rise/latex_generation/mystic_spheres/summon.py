        Spell('Summon Monster', 1, None, """
            You summon a creature in an unoccupied square on stable ground within \\rngmed range.
            It visually appears to be a common Small or Medium animal of your choice, though in reality it is a manifestation of magical energy.
            Regardless of the appearance and size chosen, the creature's statistics use the values below.
            If a summoned creature gains a \\glossterm<vital wound> or has no hit points remaining at the end of a phase, it disappears.

            \\begin<itemize>
                \item Its \\glossterm<fatigue tolerance> is 0, and it cannot choose to take actions that would give it \\glossterm<fatigue points>.
                \\item Its \\glossterm<hit points> are equal to half the base value for your level (see \\tref<Hit Points>).
                \\item Each of its \\glossterm<defenses> is equal to 4 \\add your level.
                \\item Its \\glossterm<accuracy> is equal to your level \\add half your base Perception \\add your \\glossterm<magic bonuses> to accuracy \\sub 2.
                \\item Its \\glossterm<land speed> is 30 feet.
                \\item It has no \\glossterm<attunement points>.
            \\end<itemize>

            Each round, you can choose the creature's actions by mentally commanding it as a \\glossterm<minor action>.
            There are only two actions it can take.
            As a \\glossterm<move action>, it can move as you direct.
            As a standard action, it can make a melee \\glossterm<strike> against a creature it threatens.
            If it hits, it deals physical damage equal to 1d6 plus half your \\glossterm<power>.
            The subtypes of damage dealt by this attack depend on the creature's appearance, but are limited to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
            Most animals bite or claw their foes, which deals bludgeoning and slashing damage.

            If you do not command the creature's actions, it will continue to obey its last instructions if possible or do nothing otherwise.
            Summoned creatures have no mind or independent agency, and will not act on their own even if attacked.

            The weapon's maximum height above the ground is limited to 10 feet.
