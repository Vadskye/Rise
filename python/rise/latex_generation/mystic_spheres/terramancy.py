# Many terramany effects are limited by the requirement that either you or
# your target must be near earth.

# Requiring the caster to be near earth is an easily mitigatable downside,
# so those spells gain no special bonus.
# Requiring the target to be near earth is a more significant downside,
# so those spells gain a bonus - generally increased area or range.
