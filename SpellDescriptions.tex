\spellsection{Ablate Impact}
\spellschool{Abjuration (Shielding)}
\spelllvl{Abjur 2}
\spelltime{1 immediate action}
\spellrng{Personal}
\spelltgt{You}
\spelldur{1 round}
\begin{spelleffect}
  You gain physical damage reduction 10/force. This damage reduction increases by 1 per caster level above 4th.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  This spell's damage reduction allows the subject to ignore the first 10 physical damage it takes each round. If it is hit by a attack that deals force damage, such as \spell{magic missile}, it cannot use its damage reduction for 1 round.

  You can cast this spell instantaneously, quickly enough react to an opponent attacking you (but before the attack is rolled).
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Ablative Shield}
\spelldesc{You instantly encase yourself a shimmering field of magical energy, protecting you from hostile magic.}
\spellschool{Abjuration (Negation) [Magic]}
\spelllvl{Abjur 1, Magic 1}
\spellcmp{Verbal only}
\spelltime{1 immediate action}
\spellrng{\rngpers}
\spelltgt{You}
\spelldur{1 round}
\begin{spelleffect}
  You gain spell damage reduction 5/force. This damage reduction increases by 1 per caster level above 2nd.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  This spell's damage reduction allows the subject to ignore the first 5 damage it takes each round from spells and spell-like abilities. If it is hit by a attack that deals force damage, such as \spell{magic missile}, it cannot use its damage reduction for 1 round.
  
  Spells that are not subject to spell resistance are not affected by \spell{ablative shield}. You can cast this spell instantly - quickly enough to gain its benefits in an emergency. Casting the spell is an immediate action, so you can use this spell even when it's not your turn.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Acid Arrow}
\spelldesc{You fire a magical arrow of acid from your hand that speeds to its target.}
\spellschool{Conjuration (Creation) [Acid]}

\end{spelleffect}

  If the target becomes submerged in water or takes at least ten points of cold or fire damage, this spell's effect ends.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellschool{Conjuration (Creation) [Acid]}

\spellrng{\rngfar}
\spelldef{Magic vs. Reflex and Fortitude}
\spelldmg{5d8 acid damage \add 2d8 per round}
\begin{spelleffect}

\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
   If the target becomes submerged in liquid or takes at least twenty points of fire or cold damage, this spell's effect ends.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellschool{Conjuration (Creation) [Acid]}
\spelllvl{Arcane 8, Destruction 8}
\spellrng{\rngmed}
\spellarea{\areamed radius spread}
\spelleff{Fog in the area}
\spelldur{\durshort}
\spelldef{Magic vs. Fortitude}
\spellsr{No}
\spelldmg{4d6 acid damage per round}
\begin{spelleffect}
    This spell functions like \spell{solid fog}, except that the fog is highly acidic. At the end of each round, you make a magic attack vs. Fortitude to deal damage to everything in the area. A failed attack deals half damage.

\spellschool{Enchantment (Emotion) [Mind-Affecting, Morale]}
\spelllvl{Divine 2}
\spellrng{\rngclose}
\spelltgt{One creature}
\spelldur{\durshort}
\spelldef{Magic vs. Will (harmless)}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  The subject gains temporary hit points equal 10 \add 1 per caster level above 4th. In addition, it gains a \plus2 enhancement bonus to Will defense. \bonusscalingdescription  If the subject takes life damage, it loses all temporary hit points provided by this spell before applying the damage.
\end{spelleffect}

\spellsection{Air Walk}
\spelldesc{You imbue the subject with the ability to walk on nothing but air.}
\spellschool{Transmutation (Imbuement) [Air]}
\spelllvl{Air 4, Divine 4, Nature 4, Travel 4}
\spellrng{\rngtouch}
\spelltgt{Creature (Gargantuan or smaller) touched}
\spelldur{\durshort}
\spelldef{Magic vs. Fortitude (harmless)}
\spellsr{Yes (Fortitude)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  The subject can walk on air as if it were solid ground. The magic only affects the subject's legs, and does not grant the ability to climb vertically through the air.
  \par Should the spell end while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 damage per 10 feet of fall.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  \par You can cast \spell{air walk} on a specially trained mount so it can be ridden through the air. You can train a mount to move with the aid of \spell{air walk} (counts as a trick; see Handle Animal skill) with one week of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Align Weapon}
\spelldesc{You enhance a weapon while bringing it closer to your ideals.}
\spellschool{Evocation/Transmutation (Augment, Channeling) [see text]}
\spelllvl{Chaos 2, Evil 2, Good 2, Law 2}
\spelldef{Magic vs. Will (object)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell functions like \spell{magic weapon}, except that it also makes a weapon good, evil, lawful, or chaotic, as you choose, allowing it to overcome damage reduction of the appropriate type. When cast on a weapon that already has an alignment, you make a magic attack vs. Will. If you succeed, the spell's alignment overrides the alignment of the weapon.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  When you make a weapon good, evil, lawful, or chaotic, \spell{align weapon} is a good, evil, lawful, or chaotic spell, respectively.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Alter Weapon}
\spellschool{Transmutation (Alteration)}
\spelllvl{Arcane 1}
\spellrng{Touch}
\spelltgt{Touched weapon}
\spelldur{\durmed}
\spelldef{Magic vs. Will (object)}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
    You can transform the target weapon into a different weapon from the same weapon group. In addition, you can decrease (but not increase) its size by one size category.
\end{spelleffect}

\spellsectioncomma{Alter Weapon}{Greater}
\spellschool{Transmutation (Alteration)}
\spelllvl{Arcane 4}
\begin{spelleffect}
    This spell functions like \spell{alter weapon}, except that you can transform the target weapon into any other type of manufactured weapon (not improvised weapon). In addition, you can decrease or increase its size by one size category. At any point during this spell's duration, you can concentrate as a standard action to change the weapon again.
\end{spelleffect}

\spellsection{Animal Growth}
\spelldesc{You cause a number of animals grow to twice their normal size and eight times their normal weight.}
\spellschool{Transmutation (Polymorph) [Size-Affecting]}

\spellrng{\rngmed}
\spellarea{\areamed radius limit}
\spelltgts{Five animals (Gargantuan or smaller) within the area}

\end{spelleffect}

\begin{comment}
\spellsection{Animate Objects}
\spelldesc{You imbue inanimate objects with mobility and a semblance of life.}
\spellschool{Transmutation (Animation)}
\spelllvl{Chaos 5, Trans 5}
\spellrng{\rngmed}
\spellarea{\areamed radius limit}
\spelltgts{One Small object/level within the area; see text}
\spelldur{\durshort}
\spelldef{None}
\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
  Each animated object immediately attacks whomever or whatever you initially designate. Your control of the objects is limited to simple commands (``Attack,'' ``Defend,'' ``Stop,'' and so forth).
  \par An animated object can be of any nonmagical material. You may animate one Small or smaller object or an equivalent number of larger objects per caster level. A Medium object counts as two Small or smaller objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as sixteen, and a Colossal object as thirty-two. You can give the objects new commands as a move action, as normal for directing an active spell.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  This spell cannot animate objects carried or worn by a creature. This spell can be made permanent with a \spell{permanency} ritual.
\end{spellnotes}
\end{comment}

\spellsection{Animate Plants}
\spelldesc{You imbue inanimate plants with mobility and a semblance of life.}
\spellschool{Transmutation (Animation)}
\spelllvl{Nature 5, Plant 5}
\spelltgts{One Small plant/level within the area; see text}
\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell functions as \spell{animate objects}, except that you animate plants instead of inanimate objects.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  \spell{Animate plants} cannot affect plant creatures, nor does it affect nonliving vegetable material.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Antilife Shell}
\spelldesc{You create an immobile, spherical energy field that hedges out living creatures.}
\spellschool{Abjuration (Interdiction) [Barrier]}
\spelllvl{Divine 7, Nature 6, Wild 7}
\spellarea{\areasmall radius immobile emanation from you}
\spelldur{\durlong (D)}
\spelldef{None}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  Living creatures cannot enter the spell's area. Nonliving creatures, such as constructs and undead, suffer no ill effect.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  Barrier spells may be used only defensively, not aggressively. Creatures in the area at the time that the spell is cast are unaffected by the spell.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Antimagic Field}
\spelldesc{You create a mobile, spherical energy field that suppresses magic.}
\spellschool{Abjuration (Negation) [Magic]}
\spelllvl{Abjur 7, Divine 8, Magic 7}
\spellarea{\areasmall radius mobile emanation from you}
\spelldur{\durlong (D)}
\spelldef{None}
\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
  All spells, spell-like abilities, supernatural abilities, and magic items fail to function within the area of this spell. They cannot be activated from within the field, and any existing effects brought into or cast into the area are suppressed. Time spent within an \spell{antimagic field} counts against a suppressed spell's duration.
  \par Summoned creatures of any type and incorporeal undead disappear if they enter an \spell{antimagic field}. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations, such as \spell{create water}, are not affected by an \spell{antimagic field} because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result.)
  \par Creatures within an \spell{antimagic field} cannot dismiss spells. However, you can dismiss your own antimagic field.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  A normal creature can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword. The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned.
  \par \spell{Dispel magic} does not remove the field. Two or more \spell{antimagic fields} sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as \spell{wall of force}, \spell{prismatic sphere}, and \spell{prismatic wall}, remain unaffected by \spell{antimagic field} (see the individual spell descriptions).
  \par Any part of a creature that lies outside the field is unaffected by the field.
  \par Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. 
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Aqueous Blade}
\spelldesc{You transform the active part of your ally's weapon into water, weakening its blows but allowing it penetrate your foe's defenses more easily.}
\spellschool{Transmutation (Alteration) [Water]}
\spelllvl{Nature 2, Water 2}
\spellrng{\rngclose}
\spelltgt{One weapon}
\spelldur{\durshort (D)}
\spelldef{Magic vs. Will}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  Attacks with the affected weapon are made against Reflex defense instead of Armor defense. However, damage with the weapon is halved, including any bonuses to damage.
\end{spelleffect}

\spellsection{Assimilate}
\spelldesc{Your pointing finger turns black as obsidian. You touch a creature and it dissolves into dust as you assimilate its form into your own body.}
\spellschool{Necromancy/Transmutation (Augment, Life)}
\spelllvl{Arcane 9, Evil 9}
\spellrng{\rngtouch}
\spelltgt{Touched living creature}
\spelldur{Instantaneous and one hour; see text}
\spelldef{Magic vs. Fortitude}
\spellsr{Yes (Fortitude)}
\spelldmg{18d8 life damage \add d6 per four caster levels above 18th}
\begin{spelleffect}
    The target takes damage. A failed attack deals half damage. If the target has no hit points remaining after taking damage from this spell, it is entirely assimilated into your form, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. An assimilated creature's equipment is unaffected.
    \par If the creature has at least 1 hit point following your use of this power, you gain temporary hit points equal to half the damage you dealt for 1 hour.
    \par If the creature is completely assimilated, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the damage you dealt and a \plus4 enhancement bonus to each of your attributes for 1 hour. In addition, you gain the appearance of the creature for 1 hour, granting you a \plus10 enhancement bonus on Disguise checks made to appear as that creature during that time.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    If you take life damage, you lose all temporary hit points provided by this spell before applying the damage.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Aversion}
\spelldesc{You make the subject want to avoid something.}
\spellschool{Enchantment (Emotion) [Mind-Affecting]}
\spelllvl{Ench 3}
\spellrng{\rngmed}
\spelltgt{One creature}
\spelldur{\durext}
\spelldef{Magic vs. Will}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  An affected creature feels an aversion to a particular person or object. If the object of the implanted aversion is an individual or a physical object, she will prefer not to approach within 30 feet of it. If it is a word, she will try not to utter it; if it is an action, she will not willingly attempt to perform it; and if it is an event, she will not willingly attend it. The subject will take reasonable steps to avoid the object of its aversion, but will not put herself in jeopardy by doing so.
  \par If the subject is forced into taking an action she has an aversion to, she is bewildered as long as she performs the action, making her \vulnerable.
\end{spelleffect}

\spellsection{Bane}
\spelldesc{You fill your enemies with dismay, impairing their ability to fight.}

\spelldesc{You force extraplanar creatures back to their home plane.}
\spellschool{Abjuration/Conjuration (Interdiction, Translocation) [Planar]}
\spelllvl{Arcane 6, Divine 6}
\spellcmp{Verbal, Somatic, and Focus}
\spellrng{\rngmed}
\spelltgts{One extraplanar creature/round}
\spelldur{Concentration}
\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell functions like \spell{dismissal}, except that you can banish one additional extraplanar creature each round that you concentrate on the spell. An individual creature can only be targeted once per casting of this spell.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  You can improve the spell's chance of success by presenting at least one object or substance that the target hates, fears, or otherwise opposes. For each such object or substance, you gain a \plus2 bonus on your caster level with the spell. For example, if this spell were cast on a demon that hated light and was \vulnerable to holy water and cold iron weapons, you might use iron, holy water, and a torch in the spell. The three items would give you a \plus6 bonus on your caster level. 
  \par Certain rare items might work twice as well as a normal item for the purpose of the bonuses (each providing a \plus4 bonus to your caster level).
\end{spellnotes}
\spellfocus{Any item that is distasteful to the subject (optional, see above)}

\spellsection{Barkskin}
\spelldesc{You toughen a creature's skin, giving it the appearance of tree bark.}

\spelldur{\durshort}
\spelldef{Magic vs. Fortitude (harmless)}
\spellsr{Yes (Fortitude)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  The subject gains a \plus2 enhancement bonus to its armor modifier. \bonusscalingdescription In addition, the subject gains physical damage reduction 2/adamantine or fire. This damage reduction increases by 1 per two levels above 4th.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  This spell's damage reduction allows the subject to ignore the first 2 physical damage it takes each round. If it is hit by a adamantine weapon or an attack that deals fire damage, it cannot use its damage reduction for 1 round.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Bestow Curse}
\spelldesc{You place a curse on your foe, crippling its ability to act.}
\spellschool{Necromancy (Life) [Curse]}
\spelllvl{Death 5, Divine 5, Evil 5, Necro 5}
\spellrng{\rngclose}
\spelltgt{One creature}
\spelldur{Permanent}
\spelldef{Magic vs. Will}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  The subject suffers one of the following three effects, chosen by you:
  \begin{itemize*}
    \item \minus6 penalty to an attribute.
    \item \minus4 penalty on attacks, defenses, and checks.
    \item Each turn, the target has a 25\% chance to take no action; otherwise, it acts normally.
  \end{itemize*}
  \par You may also invent your own curse, but it should be no more powerful than those described above.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  Curses cannot be dispelled.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Black Tentacles}
\spelldesc{You conjure a field of rubbery black tentacles, each 5 feet long. These waving members seem to spring forth from the earth, floor, or whatever surface is underfoot -- including water. They grasp and entwine around creatures that enter the area, holding them fast and crushing them with great strength.}
\spellschool{Conjuration/Transmutation (Animation, Creation)}
\spelllvl{Arcane 7}
\spellrng{\rngmed}
\spellarea{\areasmall radius spread}
\spelleff{Black tentacles in the area}
\spelldur{\durshort (D)}
\spelldef{None}
\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
  When you cast this spell, and at the start of each of your turns, every creature within the area of the spell is the target of a grapple attack. This attack is also made in the round that \spell{black tentacles} is cast. Treat the tentacles attacking a particular target as a Medium creature with a base attack bonus equal to your caster level and a Strength score of 8. Thus, its grapple attack modifier is equal to your caster level \plus8. Roll only once each round for the entire spell effect, and apply the result to all creatures within the area of effect.
  \par If the tentacles succeed in grappling a foe, that foe takes 1d8\plus4 damage. Each round that black tentacles succeeds on a grapple attack, it deals an additional 1d8\plus4 damage. The tentacles continue to crush the opponent until the spell ends or the opponent escapes.
  \par The tentacles are immune to all types of damage. The entire area of effect is considered difficult terrain while the tentacles last, and any creature that enters the area of the spell is immediately attacked by the tentacles.
\end{spelleffect}

\spellsection{Blade Barrier}
\spelldesc{You create an immobile, vertical curtain of whirling blades shaped of pure force.}
\spellschool{Evocation (Energy) [Force, Wall]}
\spelllvl{Divine 6, War 6}

\spelleff{Wall of whirling blades up to 100 ft. long, or a ringed wall of whirling blades with a radius of up to 20 ft.; either form 20 ft. high}
\spelldur{\durshort (D)}
\spelldef{Magic vs. Reflex}
\spellsr{Yes (Reflex)}
\spelldmg{6d6 force damage \add d6 per four caster levels above 12th}
\begin{spelleffect}
    Whenever a creature passes through the wall, you make a magic attack vs. Reflex to deal damage to it. A failed attack deals half damage. If you create the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. If your attack fails against those creatures, they can avoid the wall completely, ending up on the side of their choice.
  \par A \spell{blade barrier} provides cover (\plus4 bonus to physical defenses) against attacks made through it.
\end{spelleffect}

\spellsection{Blasphemy}
\spelldesc{You speak an unholy utterance of great power, afflicting all those nearby who do not share your allegiance to evil.}
\spellschool{Evocation (Channeling) [Evil]}

\spelldesc{You fill your allies with confidence, improving their prowess in combat.}
\spellschool{Enchantment (Emotion) [Mind-Affecting, Morale]}

\spellsection{Blindness/Deafness}
\spelldesc{You afflict one of the subject's senses.}

\end{spellblood}
\begin{spellnotes}
   The choice of bloodied conditions is made at the time the spell is cast.

\spellsection{Blink}
\spelldesc{You rapidly blink in and out of reality, confounding your foes and protecting you from their attacks.}
\spellschool{Conjuration (Translocation) [Planar]}
\spelllvl{Arcane 4}
\spellrng{\rngpers}
\spelltgt{You}
\spelldur{\durshort (D)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  You ``blink" back and forth between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. This has several effects, as follows.
  \begin{itemize*}
    \item All attacks made against you and spells targeted on you have a 50\% chance to fail. This failure chance is reduced to 20\% if the attack can strike ethereal targets or if the attacker can see ethereal targets. If both are true, the attack suffers no chance of failure. Force effects can strike ethereal targets.
    \item You take half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane).
    \item You take half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.
    \item All of your attacks and spells have a 20\% chance to happen while you are in the Ethereal Plane, which usually means they have no effect.
    \item You can move at only three-quarters speed (because movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed, and you spend about half your time there and half your time material.)
    \item You can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50\% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 damage per 5 feet so traveled. 
    \item You can see and interact with ethereal creatures in roughly the same way you interact with material ones.
  \end{itemize*}
\end{spelleffect}

\spellsection{Blur}
\spelldesc{You distort the subject's outline so it appears blurred, shifting, and wavering.}
\spellschool{Illusion (Glamer)}
\spelllvl{Arcane 2}
\spellrng{\rngclose}
\spelltgt{One creature}
\spelldur{\durshort (D)}
\spelldef{Magic vs. Will (harmless)}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
    Other creatures take a \minus2 penalty on checks and physical attacks against the subject that rely on sight, such as Perception and Sense Motive checks.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  A \spell{see invisibility} spell does not counteract the blurring effect, but a \spell{true seeing} spell does.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Burning Hands}
\spelldesc{You expel a cone of searing flame shoots from your fingertips, searing creatures in front of you.}
\spellschool{Evocation (Energy) [Fire]}
\spelllvl{Arcane 1, Destruction 1, Nature 1, Fire 1}
\spellarea{\areamed cone-shaped burst}

\begin{spelleffect}
  Immediately upon completion of the spell, and once per round thereafter, you may call down a vertical bolt of lightning which deals damage to anyone in its path. When you do, you make a magic attack vs. Reflex to deal damage to everything in the bolt's path. A failed attack deals half damage. Calling a bolt is a standard action that requires concentration. You may call a total number of bolts equal to your caster level.
  \par If you are outdoors and in a stormy area -- a rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a tornado (including a whirlwind formed by a djinni or an air elemental of at least Large size) -- each bolt deals 3d10 electricity damage \add d10 per four caster levels above 6th instead.

\begin{spelleffect}
  Creatures in the area have their emotions calmed. Creatures so affected cannot take violent actions (although they can defend themselves) or do anything destructive.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  Any aggressive action against or damage dealt to a calmed creature immediately breaks the spell on all calmed creatures.

\spelldef{None}
\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
  Your staff turns into a creature that looks and fights just like a treant. The staff-treant defends you and obeys any spoken commands. However, it is by no means a true treant; it cannot converse with actual treants or control trees. If the staff-treant is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it crumbles to powder and the staff is destroyed. Otherwise, the staff returns to its normal form when the spell duration expires (or when the spell is dismissed), and it can be used as the focus for another casting of the spell. The staff-treant is always at full strength when created, despite any wounds it may have incurred the last time it appeared.
\end{spelleffect}
\spellfocus{The quarterstaff, which must be specially prepared. The staff must be a sound limb cut from an ash, oak, or yew, then cured, shaped, carved, and polished (a process requiring twenty-eight days).

\spelldur{\durlong}
\spelldef{Magic vs. Will}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
    The subject regards you as its trusted friend and ally. If it is currently faced with any obvious threat from you or your allies, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the creature, you take a \minus5 penalty on the magic attack.
  \par The spell does not enable you to control the subject as if it were an automaton, but it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must succeed at a Persuasion check to convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) Treat the target as a friend (a \plus10 relationship modifier) for the purpose of the Persuasion check. An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the \spell{charmed} person breaks the spell. A creature that resists this spell is immune to all further attempts by the same spellcaster for 24 hours.

\spelldef{Magic vs. Fortitude}

\begin{spellblood}
    You make a magic attack vs. Fortitude against each affected creature. A successful attack reduces the target to 0 hit points and deals 9 critical damage, causing the target to begin dying.
\end{spellblood}
\begin{spellnotes}
  This spell can affect 2 levels worth of living creatures per caster level. Creatures with the lowest level are affected first; among creatures with equal levels, those who are closest to the burst's point of origin are affected first. No creature whose level is greater than half your caster level can be affected, and levels that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Healthy creatures are not affected by the spell, and do not count against the spell's level limit.

\spellsr{Yes (Fortitude)}
\spelldmg{2d10 force damage \add half casting attribute}
\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell functions like \spell{interposing hand}, except that the hand can also strike foes. Each round, as a swift action, you can command the hand to attack a foe. If you do, it makes a physical attack against that foe during the action phase. Its attack bonus equals your caster level \add your casting attribute (the hand's Strength) \sub 1 (for being Large).
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellblood}
    If the struck creature is bloodied, you also make a magic attack vs. Fortitude to daze it for 1 round.
\end{spellblood}
\begin{spellnotes}
  The floating hand can move as far as 60 feet and can attack in the same round. Since this hand is directed by you, its ability to notice or attack invisible or concealed creatures is no better than yours.
\end{spellnotes}

  \par First, each shielded creature gains a \plus5 enhancement bonus to its defenses.
  \par Second, each shielded creature gains spell resistance against lawful spells and spells cast by lawful creatures.
  \par Third, if a lawful creature within \rngmed range of the shielded creature successfully attacks it in any way, the offending attacker takes 4d6 damage. Any single creature can take this damage only once per round.
\end{spelleffect}

\spellsection{Cloudkill}
\spelldesc{You conjure a yellowish green fog bank that obscures vision and slowly poisons creatures inside.}
\spellschool{Conjuration (Creation) [Fog, Poison]}
\spelllvl{Arcane 7}
\spelldef{Magic vs. Fortitude}
\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell functions like \spell{fog cloud}, except that the fog is poisonous. At the end of each round, you make a magic attack vs. Fortitude against all living creatures in the area to deal 1d4 Constitution damage.
  \par Unlike a \spell{fog cloud}, the \spell{cloudkill} moves away from you at 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground. Figure out the cloud's new spread each round based on its new point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from the point of origin where you cast the spell.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  Holding one's breath doesn't help against the poison, but creatures immune to poison are unaffected.
  \par Because the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down den or sinkhole openings. It cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast underwater.

\begin{spelleffect}
    Creatures in the area are \dazzled and \bewildered.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  Creatures who cannot see the light are not affected by this spell. Merely closing one's eyes is insufficient protection, however.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Combat Transformation}
\spelldesc{You become a virtual fighting machine -- stronger, tougher, faster, and more skilled in combat. Your mind-set changes so that you relish combat instead of casting spells.}

\begin{spellblood}
  The subject must perform one of the following actions, as you choose.
  \par \subspell{Approach} On its turn, the subject moves toward you as quickly and directly as possible. The creature may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal.

  \par \subspell{Fall} As soon as possible, the subject falls to the ground. It may act normally on its turn, except that it can't get up from its prone position.

\spelldef{None}
\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
  Depending on the version you choose, the \spell{control water} spell raises or lowers water.
  \par \subspell{Lower Water} This causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by as much as 2 feet per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch). The water is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides are up to caster level \mtimes 10 feet long. In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell.
  \par \subspell{Raise Water} This causes water or similar liquid to rise in height, just as the lower water version causes it to lower. Boats raised in this way slide down the sides of the hump that the spell creates. If the area affected by the spell includes riverbanks, a beach, or other land nearby, the water can spill over onto dry land.

  This spell allows you to create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. You choose what type of sound this spell creates when casting it and cannot thereafter change the sound's basic character.
  \par The volume of sound created depends on your level. You can produce as much noise as two normal humans per caster level. Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The noise a \spell{ghost sound} spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit, including speech. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting.

The swarms remain stationary, attacking any creatures in their area, unless you command the creeping doom to move (a standard action). As a standard action, you can command any number of the swarms to move toward any prey within \rngmed range of you. You cannot command any swarm to move more than \rngmed range away from you, and if you exceed that distance, the swarm remains stationary, attacking any creatures in its area (but it can be commanded again if you move within range).

\begin{spelleffect}
  Depending on the version selected, you create up to four lights that resemble lanterns or torches (and cast that amount of light), or up to four glowing spheres of light (which look like will-o'-wisps), or one faintly glowing, vaguely humanoid shape. The \spell{dancing lights} must stay within a \areasmall radius in relation to each other. You can spend a swift action on your turn to move the lights as you desire: forward or back, up or down, straight or turning corners, or the like. The lights can move up to 100 feet per round. A light winks out if the distance between you and it exceeds the spell's range.

  This spell functions like \spell{fireball}, except that it is larger and can detonate up to 5 rounds after the spell is cast. You select the amount of delay upon completing the spell, and that time cannot change once it has been set unless someone touches the bead (see below). For every round that this spell is delayed, your caster level with it increases by 2.

  If you choose a delay, a glowing bead sits at the point of origin until it detonates. A creature can pick up and hurl the bead as a thrown weapon (range increment 10 feet). If a creature handles and moves the bead within 1 round of its detonation, there is a 25\% chance that the bead detonates while being handled.

    As you cast this spell, you choose an alignment: good, evil, lawful, or chaotic. Anything within the spell's area that has the chosen alignment has a faint aura, visible only to you.
    
    By concentrating on an aura (a standard action), you can determine the strength of the aura. Most aligned creatures and magic items have a faint aura. Creatures that embody the alignment (such as undead and outsiders with an aligned creature subtype) have a moderate aura. Creatures that act directly on behalf of the alignment (such as paladins and some clerics), and exceptionally potent aligned magic items (primarily artifacts) have a strong aura.
\end{spelleffect}

  \par When used against an object, the ray simply disintegrates as much as one 10-foot cube of nonliving matter. Thus, the spell disintegrates only part of any very large object or structure targeted. The ray affects even objects constructed entirely of force, \spell{wall of force}, but not magical effects such as an \spell{antimagic field}.

\spelldur{Instantaneous; see text}
\spelldef{None}
\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
  You can use \spell{dispel magic} to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.
  \par Note: The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect. 
  \par You choose to use dispel magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell.

  \par \subspell{Targeted Dispel} One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make a single dispel check (1d20 \add your caster level) which applies against all spells or effects currently active on the target. The DC for this dispel check is 11 \add the caster level of the effect. Your check is compared against each effect's DC. If you succeed on the check, each effect with that DC is dispelled.

  \par If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning) and you succeed on your dispel check, you end the spell that conjured the object or creature.
  \par If the object that you target is a magic item, you compare your dispel check against the item's caster level. If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 5 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.
  \par You may choose to automatically succeed or fail on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.
  \par \subspell{Area Dispel} When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a \areamed radius.

  \par This functions as a targeted dispel against every creature, object, and ongoing spell in the area, except that you can only dispel one effect from each target in the area. The effect dispelled is the one with the highest spell level that your dispel check would succeed against. If multiple spells qualify, choose randomly. Attended magic items are unaffected by an area dispel.

  \par \subspell{Counterspell} When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.

\begin{spelleffect}
  You can control the actions of any humanoid creature through a telepathic link that you establish with the subject's mind.
  \par If you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as ``Come here," ``Go there," ``Fight," and ``Stand still." If you concentrate on the spell, you know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically.
  \par Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth). Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill description).
  It takes time for the link to be established. For the first hour after the spell is cast, you must concentrate on the spell (a standard action) to control the subject's actions. While you are not concentrating on the spell, the creature acts as if confused, as the \spell{confusion} spell, except that it never attacks you. If the subject would randomly attack you, it instead is forced to follow your commands. At the end of the hour, you must make a second Will attack. If you concentrate on the spell during this time, you gain a \plus4 bonus to the attack. If your attack succeeds, you dominate the creature fully for the remainder of the spell duration. Otherwise, the creature is freed.
  \par After the first hour, changing your instructions or giving a dominated creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.
  \par By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can't communicate with you. You can't actually see through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on.
  \par Subjects resist this control, and you must make a new attack to force the subject to take an action against its nature. Failure means it breaks free. This does not apply when a subject is merely ordered to perform an action it disagrees with -- the action must be directly opposed to the subject's beliefs. Ordering a paladin to murder an innocent would require a new attack, but ordering him to build a bridge that would allow an evil army to cross a river would not. If your command would obviously lead to the creature's death, your attack takes a \minus10 penalty. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control it.
  \par If you recast this spell on a subject you have dominated before it escapes your control, you can extend the duration of the spell indefinitely. You do not need to make a new attack when you renew your control in this fashion.

\spelldef{Magic vs. Reflex}
\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
    This spell has various effects, depending on the terrain. Regardless of the terrain, creatures on the ground can't move and take a \minus10 penalty to physical attacks. A spellcaster on the ground who attempts to cast a spell must make a Concentration check against a DC equal to (your attack result \add double the level of the spell being cast) or lose the spell. The specific effect of an earthquake spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.
  \par \subspell{Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel} The spell collapses the roof, dealing 8d8 bludgeoning damage \add d8 per four caster levels above 16th to any creature caught under the cave-in. If your attack is successful against a creature, it is pinned beneath the rubble, while a failed attack deals half damage. An earthquake cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris.
  \par \subspell{Cliffs} Earthquake causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it fell vertically. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 bludgeoning damage \add d6 per four caster levels above 16th. If your attack is successful against a creature, it is pinned beneath the rubble, while a failed attack deals half damage.
  \par \subspell{Open Ground} If your attack is successful against a creature, it falls prone. In addition, fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25\% chance to be above one. You make a magic attack vs. Reflex against each creature threatened by a fissure. A successful attack causes a creature to fall into the fissure. At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut, dealing 8d10 bludgeoning damage \add d10 per four caster levels above 16th to any creatures trapped in them and ejecting their bodies (dead or alive).
  \par \subspell{Structure} Any structure standing on open ground takes 10 damage per caster level, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 bludgeoning damage \add d6 per four caster levels above 16th. If your attack is successful against a creature, it is pinned beneath the rubble, while a failed attack deals half damage.
  \par \subspell{River, Lake, or Marsh} Fissures open underneath the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures.  If your attack is successful against a creature, it sinks ten feet beneath the surface, buried in the mud and quicksand. A DC 25 Climb or Swim check is required to escape. At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    A creature pinned beneath rubble is treated as being pinned. Each round, it can attempt to escape the pin as a standard action. Escaping requires a DC 20 Escape Artist check or grapple attack. As long as it stays pinned, it takes 1d6 nonlethal damage per minute. If a pinned creature falls unconscious, it takes 1d6 lethal damage each minute until it is freed or dies.

    You loudly declare a single, specific rule which which all creatures must obey, such as ``Do not use ranged weapons'' or ``Do not lie''. If the rule is too complicated, the spell fails. The spell grants all creatures that enter the area an understanding of the rule, even if they were unable to understand the rule as originally stated.

    Once the rule is established, any creature within the area who breaks the rule takes damage. You know whenever a creature in the area breaks the rule, but you do not know which creature. If you break the rule, you take damage and the spell ends.

  This spell opens a portal to an Elemental Plane and summons elementals from it. A druid can choose the plane (Air, Earth, Fire, or Water); a cleric opens a portal to the plane matching his domain.
  \par When the spell is complete, 2d4 Large elementals appear. Five minutes later, 1d4 Huge elementals appear. Five minutes after that, one greater elemental appears. Once these creatures appear, they serve you for the duration of the spell.
  \par The elementals obey you explicitly and never attack you, even if someone else manages to gain control over them. You do not need to concentrate to maintain control over the elementals. You can dismiss them singly or in groups at any time.

\spelldef{None}
\spellsr{Yes (Fortitude)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell functions like \spell{greater resist energy}, except that you store up the energy you absorb and can later discharge it as a ray. To discharge a ray requires a standard action. You can choose to fire any number of rays during the spell's duration. The ray you fire must be of one of the energy types you have stored (if you have stored more than one type, you can choose what kind of energy to use for each ray). If a ray successfully strikes its target (requiring a Reflex attack), the target takes damage equal to the amount of energy damage of that type you have stored, up to a maximum of three times your caster level. As long as this power remains in effect, you can continue to absorb energy damage and fire additional rays using the stored damage.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  This spell's descriptor is the same as the type of energy you discharge in a ray; thus, its subtype can change during the course of the spell's duration.

  \par An undead creature struck by the ray instead gains temporary hit points equal to 40 \add your caster level and physical damage reduction 16/positive. 
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  The damage reduction allows an undead subject to ignore the first 16 physical damage it takes each round. If it is hit by an attack that deals positive damage, such as \spell{cure light wounds}, it cannot use its damage reduction for 1 round.

\spellsr{Yes (Fortitude)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  The subject gains three negative levels.
  \par Each negative level gives a creature a \minus1 penalty on attacks, special defenses, and checks. Additionally, each negative level causes the creature to lower its maximum hit points by 5, and a spellcaster loses one spell slot from his or her highest available level. If the subject has at least as many negative levels as it has levels, it dies.
  \par An undead creature gains physical damage reduction 8/positive instead. This damage reduction increases by 1 per two caster levels above 8th.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  This spell stacks with any effect that bestows negative levels, including itself.

  The damage reduction allows an undead subject to ignore the first 8 physical damage it takes each round. If it is hit by a positive attack, such as \spell{cure light wounds}, it cannot use its damage reduction for 1 round.

\spelldef{Magic vs. Fortitude}
\spellsr{Yes (Fortitude)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell causes instant growth of a humanoid creature, doubling its height and multiplying its weight by 8. This increase changes the creature's size category to the next larger one. This has several effects.
  \begin{itemize*} 
    \item \plus10 ft. bonus to movement speed.
    \item \plus4 bonus to maneuver attack and defense.
    \item \minus1 penalty to other physical attacks and defenses.
    \item \minus2 penalty to Dexterity.
    \item \plus2 enhancement bonus to Strength.
    \item \minus4 penalty to Stealth checks.
  \end{itemize*}
  \par A humanoid creature whose size increases to Large has a space of 10 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet.
  \par If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it -- the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size.
  \par All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly enlarged by the spell. Melee and projectile weapons affected by this spell deal more damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any enlarged item that leaves an enlarged creature's possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage, and projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them. Magical properties of enlarged items are not increased by this spell.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack. This spell can be made permanent with a \spell{permanency} ritual.

    At the end of each round, you make a magic attack vs. Reflex against all creature and objects in the area to make them \entangled. An entangled creature can break free and move half its normal speed by using a standard action to make a grapple attack or an Escape Artist check that beats your magic attack. Creatures in the area that are not entangled can still move at only half speed through the area.

These plants grow from any terrain, even if it would not normally support plant life, and entangle creatures in the area for the duration of the spell. When the magic fades, the plants with and recede into the ground, leaving no trace that they were ever there.

\begin{spelleffect}
  You become ethereal, along with your equipment. For the duration of the spell, you are in a place called the Ethereal Plane, which overlaps the normal, physical, Material Plane. When the spell expires, you return to material existence.
  \par An ethereal creature is invisible, insubstantial, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down, albeit at half normal speed. As an insubstantial creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear on the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and ephemeral. Sight and hearing onto the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.
  \par Force effects and abjurations affect an ethereal creature normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane (such as a basilisk's gaze attack). Treat other ethereal creatures and ethereal objects as if they were material. 
  \par If you end the spell and become material while inside a material object (such as a solid wall), you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 damage per 5 feet that you so travel.

    The affected creatures or objects fall slowly. Feather fall instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet), and the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. However, when the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes.
  \par The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including gear and carried objects up to each creature's maximum load) or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: A Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as two Large creatures or objects, and so forth.
  \par If the spell is cast on a falling item, the object does half normal damage based on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the drop.

Together, the acorns are capable of dealing 6d6 fire damage \add d6 per four caster levels above 12th, divided up among the acorns as you wish.
  \par Each acorn explodes upon striking any hard surface. When it does, you make a Reflex attack to deal damage to all creatures in a \areasmall radius burst. A failed attack deals half damage. You automatically succeed on this attack against a creature struck by the acorn directly.
  \par \subspell{Holly Berry Bombs} You turn as many as eight holly berries into special bombs. The holly berries are usually placed by hand, since they are too light to make effective thrown weapons (they can be tossed only 5 feet). Together, the holly berries are capable of dealing 6d6 fire damage \add d6 per four caster levels above 12th, divided up among the berries as you wish.
  \par If you are within \rngmed range and speak a word of command (as a standard action), each berry instantly bursts into flame. When they do, you make a Reflex attack to deal damage to every creature in a \areamed radius burst of the berries. A failed attack deals half damage.

\begin{spelleffect}
  You can make a Reflex attack to deal damage to any creature that hits you with its body or a melee weapon. If your attack fails, you deal half damage. Each individual creature can take this damage only once per round. The damage type and other effects depend on which kind of \spell{fire shield} is used. This decision must be made at the time the spell is cast.

  \par \subspell{Warm Shield} The flames are warm to the touch and deal fire damage. You gain cold damage reduction 20 \add 1 per caster level above 8th.
  \par \subspell{Chill Shield} The flames are cool to the touch and deal cold damage. You gain fire damage reduction 20 \add 1 per caster level above 8th.

  Regardless of the version, the flames are thin and wispy, giving off light equal to only half the illumination of a normal torch (10 feet).

\begin{spelleffect}
  This powerful spell brings into being an immobile, invisible cubical prison composed of either bars of force or solid walls of force (your choice).
  \par Creatures within the area are caught and contained unless they are too big to fit inside, in which case the spell automatically fails. Teleportation and other forms of astral travel provide a means of escape, but the force walls or bars extend into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.
  \par A creature who makes a Reflex save chooses whether it wants to be inside or outside of the forcecage when it forms. The forcecage is formed regardless.
  \par Like a \spell{wall of force} spell, a forcecage resists \spell{dispel magic}, but it is \vulnerable to a \spell{disintegrate} spell, and it can be destroyed by a \magicitem{sphere of annihilation} or a \magicitem{rod of cancellation}.
  \par \subspell{Barred Cage} This version of the spell produces a 20-foot cube made of bands of force (similar to a wall of force spell) for bars. The bands are a half-inch wide, with half-inch gaps between them. Any creature capable of passing through such a small space can escape; others are confined. You can't attack a creature in a barred cage with a weapon unless the weapon can fit between the gaps. Even against such weapons (including arrows and similar ranged attacks), a creature in the barred cage has cover. All spells and breath weapons can pass through the gaps in the bars.
  \par \subspell{Windowless Cell} This version of the spell produces a 10-foot cube with no way in and no way out. Solid walls of force form its six sides.

  The subject and all its gear become insubstantial, misty, and translucent. Its armor modifier becomes 0, though other defense modifiers continue to apply normally. The subject gains physical damage reduction 10/magic and becomes immune to critical hits. It can't attack or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material, or focus components while in gaseous form. (This does not rule out the use of certain spells that the subject may have prepared using the feats Silent Spell or Still Spell.) If it has a touch spell ready to use, that spell is discharged harmlessly when the gaseous form spell takes effect.
  \par A gaseous creature can fly at a speed of 10 feet (special maneuverability). It can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with all it was wearing or holding in its hands, as long as the spell persists. The creature is subject to the effects of wind, and it can't enter water or other liquid. It also can't manipulate objects or activate items, even those carried along with its gaseous form. Continuously active items remain active, though in some cases their effects may be moot.
\end{spelleffect}

    While in the air, a creature with a glide speed can control its fall as a move action. This allows it to move up to its speed horizontally in a direction of its choice while moving only five feet down. If it desires, it can move half as far horizontally and fall down twice as fast. It takes no falling damage if it touches the ground while gliding.

  You turn three normal-sized centipedes, two normal-sized spiders, or a single normal-sized scorpion into Large-sized forms. Only one type of vermin can be transmuted (so a single casting cannot affect both a centipede and a spider), and all must be grown to the same size.
  \par Any giant vermin created by this spell do not attempt to harm you, but your control of such creatures is limited to simple commands (``Attack," ``Defend," ``Stop," and so forth). Orders to attack a certain creature when it appears or guard against a particular occurrence are too complex for the vermin to understand. Unless commanded to do otherwise, the giant vermin attack whoever or whatever is near them.

  This spell functions like \spell{interposing hand}, except the hand can also grapple foes. Each round, as a swift action, you can command the hand to grapple a foe. If you do, it makes a grapple attack against that foe during the action phase. Its attack bonus equals your caster level \add your casting attribute (the hand's Strength) \add 4 (for being Large). Its Maneuver defense is equal to 10 \add the same modifier.
  \par The hand holds but does not harm creatures it grapples. While the hand is grappling a foe, you must spend a swift action each round to command the hand to sustain the grapple; otherwise, the grappled creature escapes automatically.
  \par If you do not direct the hand to grapple, it simply provides cover as \spell{interposing hand}.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  The floating hand can move as far as 60 feet and can attack in the same round. Since this hand is directed by you, its ability to notice or attack invisible or concealed creatures is no better than yours.

    You make a Reflex attack against each creature in the area. Success means the creature falls prone. A creature can walk within or through the area of grease at half normal speed with a DC 10 Balance check. Failure means it can't move that round, while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Balance skill for details).
  \par The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item. Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while you must make a Reflex attack to affect an object wielded or employed by a creature. If you succeed, the item becomes greasy and the creature immediately drops it. A creature can pick up and use a greased item, but it takes a \minus5 penalty with all actions requiring the item, such as attacks. In addition, whenever it fails at an action while holding the item, it drops the item. A creature wearing greased armor or clothing gains a \plus10 enhancement bonus on Escape Artist checks and on grapple attacks made to resist or escape a grapple or to escape a pin.

\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell creates a severe blast of air (approximately 50 mph) that originates from you. Creatures and objects are affected according to their size. You make a Fortitude attack against everything in the area. A failed attack means the creature or object is treated as if it were one size category larger. Flying creatures are affected as if they were one size category smaller.
  \begin{itemize*}
    \item Tiny or smaller creatures are knocked prone and blown to the edge of the spell's range.
    \item Small creatures are knocked prone by the force of the wind.
    \item Medium creatures are unable to move forward against the force of the wind.
    \item Large or larger creatures may move normally.
  \end{itemize*}
  \par Any creature, regardless of size, takes a \minus5 penalty on ranged attacks and Listen checks in the spell's area.
  \par In addition to the effects noted, a gust of wind can do anything that a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do. It can extinguish open flames, create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings or hangings, heel over a small boat, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of its range.

  The subject must be bloodied at the time that the spell is cast to be imprisoned. Magical search by a crystal ball, a \spell{locate creature} spell, or some other similar divination does not reveal the fact that a creature is imprisoned, but \spell{discern location} does.

  The hand created by this spell stays between you and one opponent, providing you with active cover from that creature. Each physical attack that creature makes against you has a 20\% chance to strike the hand instead. In addition, if the creature is Large size or smaller, it moves at half speed while moving towards you. 
  \par If you cannot see the hand's target, it will stop moving until it is directed to a visible target. The hand does not pursue opponents.
  \par An interposing hand is 10 feet long and about that wide with its fingers outstretched. It has 3 hit points per caster level, and a physical defense of 15 (\minus1 size, \plus6 natural armor). It takes damage as a normal creature, but most effects that don't cause damage do not affect it.

\spelldef{Magic vs. Will (harmless) or Magic vs. Will (harmless, object)}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  The creature or object touched becomes invisible, vanishing from sight, even from darkvision. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too.
  \par Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 5 feet from it becomes visible.
  \par Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle). The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions.) Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as \spell{bless} that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.

\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell functions like \spell{invisibility}, except that this spell confers invisibility upon all creatures within a \areasmall radius emanation of the recipient. The center of the effect is mobile with the recipient.
  \par Those affected by this spell can see each other and themselves as if unaffected by the spell. Any affected creature moving out of the area becomes visible, but creatures moving into the area after the spell is cast do not become invisible. Affected creatures (other than the recipient) who attack negate the invisibility only for themselves. If the spell recipient attacks, the \spell{invisibility sphere} ends.

  This spell transforms your body into living iron, which grants you several powerful resistances and abilities.
  \par You gain physical damage reduction 15/adamantine. You are immune to blindness, critical hits, attribute damage, deafness, disease, drowning, electricity, poison, stunning, and all spells or attacks that affect your physiology or respiration, because you have no physiology or respiration while this spell is in effect. You take only half damage from acid and fire of all kinds.
  \par You gain a \plus5 enhancement bonus to your Strength score, but you take a \minus5 penalty to Dexterity as well, and your speed is reduced to half normal. You have a \minus8 armor check penalty. You cannot drink (and thus can't use potions) or play wind instruments.
  \par Your unarmed attacks deal damage equal to a warhammer sized for you (1d6 for Small characters or 1d8 for Medium characters), and you are considered armed when making unarmed attacks.
  \par Your weight increases by a factor of ten, causing you to sink in water like a stone. However, you could survive the crushing pressure and lack of air at the bottom of the ocean -- at least until the spell duration expires.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  This spell's damage reduction allows the subject to ignore the first 15 physical damage it takes each round. If it is hit by an adamantine weapon, it cannot use its damage reduction for 1 round.

  The knock spell telekinetically opens stuck, barred, locked, held, or arcane locked objects. If the object is stuck or held, you can immediately make an Strength check to break it open, using your caster level instead of your Strength. Others can aid you on this check as normal. In addition, if the object is locked, you can immediately make a Disable Device check to open the lock as if you had rolled a 20 on the check. You get an enhancement bonus on the Disable Device check equal to half your caster level.
\end{spelleffect}

  If knock is cast on an \spellindirect{arcane lock}{arcane locked} door, make a caster level check against a DC of 11 \add the caster level of the \spell{arcane lock}.

  This spell allows you to telekinetically move the subject up and down as you wish. A creature must be willing to be levitated, and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. As a swift action, you can mentally direct the subject to move up or down as much as 20 feet each round.

\begin{spelleffect}
  A limited wish lets you create nearly any type of effect. For example, a limited wish can do any of the following things.
  \begin{itemize*}
    \item Duplicate any general sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.
    \item Duplicate any general sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th level or lower, even if it's of a prohibited school.
    \item Duplicate any other spell of 4th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.
    \item Duplicate any other spell of 3rd level or lower, even if it's of a prohibited school.
    \item Undo the harmful effects of many spells, such as geas/quest or insanity.
    \item Produce any other effect whose power level is in line with the above effects, such as a single creature automatically hitting on its next attack or taking a \minus5 penalty to its defenses for 5 rounds.
  \end{itemize*}
  \par When casting a limited wish, you do not specify the exact spell or effect you wish to duplicate. Instead, you make a wish, describing what you want to have happen, and make a DC 15 Wisdom check. If the check fails, your intent is redirected or perverted in some way. For example, a \spell{limited wish} to turn a foe to stone would normally mimic the \spell{flesh to stone} effect of the \spell{transmute flesh and stone} spell. However, if the Wisdom check failed, your foe might gain the benefit of a \spell{stoneskin} spell instead.
  \par When a limited wish spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 1,000 gp, you must provide that component (in addition to the 1,000 gp cost for this spell).

    As you cast this spell, you choose whether to create body armor or a shield. If you choose body armor, the subject gains a \plus2 armor modifier. If you choose a shield, the subject gains a \plus2 shield modifier. The bonus granted increases to \plus3 at 8th level, to \plus4 at 14th level, and finally to \plus5 at 20th level. 
  \par Unlike mundane armor, \spell{mage armor} entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction.

\begin{spellnotes}
    If you cast this spell on the same creature twice, you can grant the creature both body armor and a shield. The armor created by this spell is treated as a separate piece or armor from any other armor the creature is wearing, so it does not stack with any existing bonuses. Since \spell{mage armor} is made of force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor.

  All magical effects within the radius of the spell, except for those on you, are disjoined. That is, spells and spell-like effects are separated into their individual components (ending the effect as a \spell{dispel magic} spell does).
  \par You also have a 2\% chance per caster level of destroying an \spell{antimagic field}.
  \par You can also use this spell to target a single item. If you succeed at a Will attack with a \plus5 bonus, the item is permanently rendered nonmagical. Even artifacts are subject to this use of disjunction, though there is only a 1\% chance per caster level of actually affecting such powerful items. Additionally, if an artifact is destroyed, you permanently lose the ability to cast \spell{mage's disjunction}. (This ability cannot be recovered by mortal magic, not even \spell{miracle} or \spell{wish}.)

  You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike (instead, see \spell{magic fang}). A monk's unarmed strike is considered a weapon, and thus it can be enhanced by this spell.
  \par If you use this spell to enhance projectiles, the projectiles must be of the same kind, and they have to be together (in the same quiver or other container).

  You banish the subject into an extradimensional labyrinth of force planes. Each round on its turn, it may attempt an Intelligence check to escape the labyrinth as a full-round action. You make a Will attack to attempt to place it in the middle of the labyrinth. A successful attack means the DC of the Intelligence check is 20, while a failed attack means the DC is 15. If the subject doesn't escape, the maze disappears after 5 minutes, forcing the subject back to the location where it was originally banished.
  \par On escaping or leaving the maze, the subject reappears where it had been when the maze spell was cast. If this location is filled with a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest open space.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as \spell{teleport} and \spell{dimension door}, do not help a creature escape a \spell{maze} spell, although a \spell{plane shift} spell allows it to exit to whatever plane is designated in that spell.

\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell enables you to meld your body and possessions into a single block of stone. The stone must be large enough to accommodate your body in all three dimensions. When the casting is complete, you and not more than 100 pounds of nonliving gear merge with the stone. If either condition is violated, the spell fails and is wasted.
  \par While in the stone, you remain in contact, however tenuous, with the face of the stone through which you melded. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while hiding in the stone. Nothing that goes on outside the stone can be seen, but you can still hear what happens around you. Minor physical damage to the stone does not harm you, but its partial destruction (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. If the stone is completely destroyed, you are expelled, and you die unless your Fortitude defense is at least 20.
  \par Any time before the duration expires, you can step out of the stone through the surface that you entered. If the spell's duration expires or the effect is dispelled before you voluntarily exit the stone, you are violently expelled and take 5d6 points of damage.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  The following spells harm you if cast upon the stone that you are occupying: \spell{transmute flesh and stone} expels you and deals 6d6 points of damage. \spellindirect{shape stone}{Shape stone} deals 3d6 points of damage but does not expel you. \spell{Passwall} expels you without damage.

  You can whisper messages and receive whispered replies with little chance of being overheard. You point your finger at each creature you want to receive the message. When you whisper, the whispered message is audible to all targeted creatures within range. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal (or a thin sheet of lead), or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks the spell. The message does not have to travel in a straight line. It can circumvent a barrier if there is an open path between you and the subject, and the path's entire length lies within the spell's range. The creatures that receive the message can whisper a reply that you hear. The spell transmits sound, not meaning. It doesn't transcend language barriers.

Once per minute, you make a Will attack against all creatures in the area to impose a \minus5 penalty to Wisdom. Affected creatures take the penalty as long as they remain in the fog and for 5 rounds thereafter. The fog is stationary and lasts for 1 hour (or until dispersed by wind).
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  A moderate wind (11\add mph) disperses the fog in 5 rounds; a strong wind (21\add mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. The penalty to Wisdom imposed by this spell does not stack with itself.

  You don't so much cast a miracle as request one. You state what you would like to have happen and request that your deity (or the power you pray to for spells) intercede.
  \par A miracle can do any of the following things.
  \begin{itemize*}
    \item Duplicate any cleric spell of 8th level or lower (including spells to which you have access because of your domains). 
    \item Duplicate any other spell of 7th level or lower.
    \item Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as feeblemind or insanity.
    \item Have any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.
  \end{itemize*}
  \par Alternatively, a cleric can make a very powerful request. Examples of especially powerful miracles of this sort could include the following.
  \begin{itemize*}
    \item Swiinging the tide of a battle in your favor by raising fallen allies to continue fighting.
    \item Moving you and your allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to another through planar barriers to a specific locale with no chance of error.
    \item Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster.
  \end{itemize*}
  \par In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity's (or alignment's) nature is refused.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  If you request a miracle, your deity (or the power you pray to) will expect something of you in return. You must cast commune to learn what this is within 24 hours, or you will lose the ability to cast any cleric spells other than commune. For more moderate miracles, you may be required to offer 25,000gp worth of incense and gems. For especially powerful miracles, or multiple moderate miracles, you may geased with a task to complete.
  \par When a miracle spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 5,000 gp, you must provide that component.

\spelldur{\durshort (D)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell creates an illusory duplicate of yourself that mimics your movements perfectly. Enemies attempting to attack you or cast spells at you must select which to attack. Generally, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. An image's physical defenses are 10 \add its size modifier. You gain an additional image at 8th, 14th, and 20th level. 
  \par If an image is hit, it is destroyed. If you are hit, your attacker knows the attack was successful, and can ignore the image. You can create new images to replace destroyed images as a swift action, preventing your foes from knowing which image to attack.
  \par You can move into and through your duplicates on your turn. When you and the image separate, observers can't use vision or hearing to tell which one is you and which the image. The duplicates may also move through each other. The figments mimic your actions, pretending to cast spells when you cast a spell, drink potions when you drink a potion, levitate when you levitate, and so on.
  \par Mirror images can be attacked like any other creature. They count as separate creatures, and can be targeted separately by spells like \spell{magic missile} or feats like Whirlwind Attack, though they are not destroyed by area spells. Destroying an image counts as dropping a creature for the purpose of the Cleave feat and similar abilities.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  An attacker must be able to see the images to be fooled. If you are invisible or an attacker shuts his or her eyes, the spell has no effect. (Being unable to see means you are blinded.)

\begin{spelleffect}
  You become invisible (as \spell{invisibility}, a glamer), and at the same time, an illusory double of you (as \spell{major image}, an unreal figment) appears. You are then free to go elsewhere while your double moves away. The double appears within range but thereafter moves as you direct it (which requires concentration beginning on the first round after the casting). You can make the figment appear superimposed perfectly over your own body so that observers don't notice an image appearing and you turning invisible. You and the figment can then move in different directions. The double moves at your speed and can talk and gesture as if it were real, but it cannot attack or cast spells, though it can pretend to do so.
  \par The illusory double lasts as long as you concentrate upon it, plus 5 additional rounds. After you cease concentration, the illusory double continues to carry out the same activity until the duration expires. The invisibility lasts for 5 minutes, regardless of concentration.

Alternately, you can expend the spell to protect yourself. If you do, you gain a bonus to your dodge modifier equal to half your caster level, and you stop being unaware of an attack if you were. This effect can be used even if you are unaware of an attack, which would normally prevent you from taking any combat actions.

  \par You can pass into and out of the prismatic sphere and remain near it without harm. However, the sphere blocks any attempt to project something through it (including spells). Other creatures that attempt to attack you or pass through suffer the effects of each color, one at a time. You can fight from partially within the sphere. If you do, you gain cover from anyone outside the sphere.

\spellsr{See text}
\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell creates a vertical, opaque wall -- a shimmering, multicolored plane of light that protects you from all forms of attack. The wall flashes with seven colors, each of which has a distinct power and purpose. The wall is immobile, and you can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. However, any other creature with less than 8 levels that is within 20 feet of the wall is blinded for 1 minute by the colors if it looks at the wall.
  \par The wall's maximum proportions are 50 feet wide and 30 feet high. A \spell{prismatic wall} spell cast to materialize in a space occupied by a creature is disrupted, and the spell is wasted.
  \par Each color in the wall has a special effect. The accompanying table shows the seven colors of the wall, the order in which they appear, their effects on creatures trying to attack you or pass through the wall, and the magic needed to negate each color.
  \par The wall can be destroyed, color by color, in consecutive order, by various magical effects; however, the first color must be brought down before the second can be affected, and so on. A rod of cancellation or a mage's disjunction spell destroys a prismatic wall, but an antimagic field fails to penetrate it. Dispel magic and greater dispel magic cannot dispel the wall or anything beyond it. Spell resistance is effective against a prismatic wall, but the caster level check must be repeated for each color present.

    When you cast this spell, you choose an action. Whenever a creature within the area intentionally attempts to take the chosen action, you make a Will attack against them. A successful attack means they are unable to complete the action, while a failed attack means they take half damage.

    You may choose any action that must be taken intentionally. For example, you could prohibit creatures from attacking, but not from breathing. Likewise, you cannot prohibit actions that have non-voluntary components, such as ``protecting yourself with natural armor''.

  You tap energy from the Plane of Shadow to create a quasi-real, illusory version of yourself. The projected image looks, sounds, and smells like you but is intangible. The projected image mimics your actions (including speech) unless you direct it to act differently (which is a move action).
  \par You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were standing where it is, and during your turn you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again, as a swift action. While you are using its senses, your body is considered blinded and deafened.
  \par If you desire, any spell you cast whose range is touch or greater can originate from the projected image instead of from you. The projected image can't cast any spells on itself except for illusion spells. The spells affect other targets normally, despite originating from the projected image.
\end{spelleffect}

  This spell causes instant diminution of a humanoid creature, halving its height, length, and width and dividing its weight by 8. This decrease changes the creature's size category to the next smaller one. This has several effects.

    \item \minus10 ft. penalty to movement speed.
    \item \minus4 penalty to maneuver attack and defense.

    \item \plus4 bonus to Stealth checks.
  \end{itemize*}
  \par A Small humanoid creature whose size decreases to Tiny has a space of 2-1/2 feet and a natural reach of 0 feet (meaning that it must enter an opponent's square to attack). A Large humanoid creature whose size decreases to Medium has a space of 5 feet and a natural reach of 5 feet.
  \par All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly reduced by the spell. Melee and projectile weapons deal less damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any reduced item that leaves the reduced creature's possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage (projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them).

  \par You can also use this spell to regrow lost portions of the subject's body and to reattach severed limbs or body parts, if you do nothing but concentrate on regrowing the lost body part or reattaching the severed limb for 5 minutes.

\begin{spelleffect}
  An invisible, mobile field surrounds you and prevents creatures from approaching you. You decide how big the field is at the time of casting. When you cast this spell, and at the start of each of your turns, you make a Will attack. Any creature within or entering the field who cannot resist your attack is unable to move towards you that round.
  
  Repelled creatures' actions are not otherwise restricted. They can fight other creatures and can cast spells and attack you with ranged weapons. The creature is free to make melee attacks against you if you come within reach. If a repelled creature moves away from you and then tries to turn back toward you, it cannot move any closer if it is still within the spell's area.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  Unlike most barrier spells, this spell does not collapse if you move towards a creature held at bay by the barrier. The spell continues to prevent that creature from approaching you, but the creature suffers no other ill effect.

\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell creates a globe of shimmering force centered around a creature or object. The sphere persists for the spell's duration, containing any creatures or objects held inside, provided they are small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere. It is not subject to damage of any sort.
  \par The subject may struggle, but the sphere cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  The sphere can only be affected a \spell{disintegrate} spell, a targeted \spell{dispel magic} spell, or similar effects. These effects destroy the sphere without harm to the subject. Nothing can pass through the sphere, inside or out, though the subject can breathe normally.

  The subject gains energy damage reduction 10 against whichever of the five energy types that you select: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. This damage reduction increases by 1 per caster level above 4th.
  \par The spell can absorb a maximum amount of damage equal to 10 points per caster level. After it absorbs its maximum amount of damage, the spell ends.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  This spell's damage reduction allows the subject to ignore the first 10 energy damage it takes each round of the appropriate type.

  Resist energy absorbs only damage. The subject could still suffer unfortunate side effects. The spell protects the recipient's equipment as well.
  \par \spellindirect{resist energy}{Resist energy} overlaps (and does not stack with) \spell{protection from energy}. If a character is shielded by both spells, the \spellindirect{protection from energy}{protection} spell absorbs damage until its power is exhausted.

In addition, the spell reflects the damage back at the creature's attackers. Any creature within \rngmed range of the subject that attacks it takes life damage equal to the amount of damage resisted by this spell.
\end{spelleffect}

  You grant the target a powerful revelatory vision of a possible future. This spell has different effects depending on the version chosen. Creatures without an Intelligence score are not affected by this spell.
  \par \subspell{Revelation of Destruction} You inflict a vision of a terrible future upon the target. It takes a \minus4 penalty to attacks, defenses, and checks as it struggles to avoid the certainty of its own doom. If it becomes bloodied, these penalties increase by 2.
  \par \subspell{Revelation of Prowess} You show the target a vision of its success in the combat to come. It gains the benefits of a \spell{greater precognition} spell.

\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell reverses gravity in an area, causing all unattached objects and creatures within that area to fall upward and reach the top of the area in 1 round. If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it in the same manner as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, until the spell ends. At the end of the spell duration, affected objects and creatures fall downward.
  %an initiative check belongs here \par A creature caught in the area can attempt a Reflex save to react to the shift in gravity. Common reactions include securing oneself if possible, or jumping to reach more stable ground.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  Creatures who can fly or levitate can keep themselves from falling, though the shift in gravity can be disorienting. A creature that reacts by jumping does not actually move until its turn, but it moves in the direction of its jump, rather than simply falling upwards.

In addition, you gain physical damage reduction equal to 10 \add 1 per two caster levels above 10th. This damage reduction is overcome by evil attacks if you are good or neutral, and by good attacks if you are evil.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  This spell's damage reduction allows the subject to ignore the first 10 physical damage it takes each round.

If the subject takes any offensive action, the spell immediately ends.

\end{spelleffect}

    You make a Reflex attack against the target to deal damage and dazzle it for 1 round. You deal extra damage equal to your caster level to undead creatures and to creatures particularly \vulnerable to bright light. If you hit an undead creature particularly \vulnerable to bright light, you deal extra damage equal to twice your caster level, and the creature is blinded for 1 round instead of being dazzled.

  You grant the touched creature the ability to see any objects or beings that are invisible within its range of vision, as well as any that are ethereal, as if they were normally visible. Such creatures are visible as translucent shapes, allowing the target to easily discern the difference between visible, invisible, and ethereal creatures.
\end{spelleffect}

  The spell does not reveal the method used to obtain invisibility. It does not reveal illusions or enable you to see through opaque objects. It does not reveal creatures who are simply hiding, concealed, or otherwise hard to see.

  Your body and all your equipment are subsumed by your shadow. As a living shadow, you blend perfectly into any other shadow and vanish in darkness. You appear as an unattached shadow in areas of full light.
  \par You can move at your normal speed, on any surface, including walls and ceilings, as well as across the surfaces of liquids -- even up the face of a waterfall.
  \par You become perfectly flat, potentially allowing you to move into locations you would not normally be able to move into.
  \par While in your shadow body, you gain damage reduction 15/solar and darkvision out to 60 feet. You are immune to ability damage, disease, drowning, and poison. You take only half damage from acid, electricity, and fire of all kinds.
  \par While affected by this spell, you can be detected by spells that read thoughts, life, or presences (including true seeing), or if you make suspicious movements in lighted areas.
  \par You cannot harm anyone physically or manipulate any objects, but you can use your spells normally. Doing so may attract notice, but if you remain in a shadowed area, you get a \plus15 enhancement bonus on your Hide check to remain unnoticed.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  This spell's damage reduction allows the subject to ignore the first 15 physical damage it takes each round. If it is hit by an attack that deals solar damage, such as \spell{sunbeam}, it cannot use its damage reduction for 1 round.

  Shadow conjuration can mimic any non-restricted sorcerer or wizard conjuration spell of 5th level or lower. If you summon a creature, as with the \spell{summon monster} spells, you may only summon a creature that you know how to summon with such a spell.
  \par When you cast this spell, you make a Will attack in addition to any other attacks required for the spell. This attack is made against any creature that interacts with the conjured object, force, or creature. If you fail, the creature disbelieves the spell.
  \par A creature that disbelieves the spell takes only half damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is half as strong (if applicable) or only half as likely to occur.
  \par A shadow creature has half the hit points of a normal creature of its kind (regardless of whether it's disbelieved). It deals normal damage and has all normal abilities and weaknesses. Against a creature that recognizes it as a shadow creature, however, the shadow creature deals half damage, and all special abilities that do not deal lethal damage are only 50\% likely to work. (Roll for each use separately.)
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  A creature that disbelieves the effect sees the shadow conjurations as transparent images superimposed on vague, shadowy forms.
  \par When you learn this spell, you choose two creatures from the 5th-level list or lower on \tref{Summon Monster List}. You can summon those creatures with this or any \spell{summon monster} spell.

  \par When you cast this spell, you make a Will attack in addition to any other attacks required for the spell. This attack is made against any creature that interacts with the conjured object, force, or creature. If you fail, the creature disbelieves the spell.
  \par A creature that disbelieves the spell takes only half damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is half as strong (if applicable) or only half as likely to occur.

The double appears superimposed over your body so that observers don't notice an image appearing and you disappearing. You can then control the image and cast spells through it even though you are on a different plane.

\spelldur{\durshort}
\spelldef{Magic vs. Will (harmless)}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
    The subject is protected by a shadowy umbra that connects directly to the Plane of Shadow. All attacks that would affect the creature, including magical and supernatural attacks, have a 50\% chance to be absorbed by the umbra. Attacks absorbed by the umbra have no effect on the subject. The umbra is selective, and does not inhibit beneficial effects.
    
    Whenever the umbra absorbs an attack, it alters the creature's appearance (including smell, sound, and other senses, as appropriate) with a glamer. This causes the creature to seem as if were affected by the attack. Outside observers have no way of knowing which attacks were absorbed by the umbra unless they can disbelieve the illusion. The spell does not attempt to conceal extraordinary attacks which cannot be disguised, such as attacks which would destroy the creature's body.

  This spell creates a connection between you and a willing subject. As you cast the spell, you decide which creature will be protected. When the protected creature would take damage to its hit points, it instead takes half of that damage (rounded down), and you lose hit points equal to the other half of the damage (rounded up).

  If the subject is out of range of you, the effect is suppressed until the subject returns within the spell's range.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  The loss of hit points caused by this spell is not damage, and is not affected by damage reduction or other abilities which affect damage. When this spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between the subject and you, but damage already shared is not reassigned.

\begin{spelleffect}
  You are able to shrink one nonmagical item to 1/16 of its normal size in each dimension (to about 1/4,000 the original volume and mass). This change effectively reduces the object's size by four categories. Optionally, you can also change its now shrunken composition to a clothlike one. Objects changed by a \spell{shrink item} spell can be returned to normal composition and size merely by tossing them onto any solid surface or by a word of command from the original caster. The object must be resting on a stable surface to return to its original size; if the command word is spoken while the object is not stable (such as while it is in the air), the object returns to its original size as soon as it finds a resting point. Even a burning fire and its fuel can be shrunk by this spell. Restoring the shrunken object to its normal size and composition ends the spell.
  \par You can shrink a Medium object at 8th level, a Large object at 12th level, a Huge object at 16th level, or a Gargantuan object at 24th level.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
This spell can be made permanent with a \spell{permanency} ritual, in which case the affected object can be shrunk and expanded an indefinite number of times, but only by the original caster. If you recast the spell each day on an object, you can keep it at its small size indefinitely.

Extraordinarily loud noises, such as the yell of a giant or a sonic attack, are merely muffled by the spell, not completely silenced. The DC to hear such sounds produced by the subject is increased by 40.

The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into solid fog is slowed, so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces falling damage by 1d6.
  \par A creature in the fog can take a full-round action to make a Strength check, moving 5 feet for every 5 by which the result exceeds DC 0. This movement is affected by any other effects which impede movement, as normal.

  Any ground-covering vegetation in the spell's area becomes very hard and sharply pointed. In areas of bare earth, roots and rootlets act in the same way. Typically, spike growth can be cast in any outdoor setting except open water, ice, heavy snow, sandy desert, or bare stone. Any foe moving on foot into or through the spell's area takes 1d4 points of physical piercing damage for each 5 feet of movement through the spiked area. Allies suffer no ill effects.

  Whenever a creature is damaged by this spell, you make a Fortitude attack against it. A successful attack makes slows its land speed by one-half. This speed penalty lasts for 12 hours or until the injured creature receives magical healing. Another character can remove the penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the injuries and succeeding on a Heal check that beats your Fortitude attack.

  The weapon created by this spell attacks once each round on your turn. This functions just as if you were attacking with the weapon, except that you use your casting ability in place of your Strength and you never get multiple attacks with the weapon.
  \par The weapon attacks the same target until you redirect it (a swift action). The weapon is treated as a separate creature for the purpose of overwhelm penalties.
  \par If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a spell penetration check the first time the spiritual weapon strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, it cannot harm that creature. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.
  \par The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you (see below), and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  The \spell{spiritual weapon} strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so, for example, ignores physical damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the normal miss chance associated with incorporeality. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers. Even if the spiritual weapon is a ranged weapon, use the spell's range, not the weapon's normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action.
  \par A \spell{spiritual weapon} cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but \spell{dispel magic}, \spell{disintegrate}, and similar effects can affect it. A spiritual weapon's physical defenses are all 12 (10 \add \plus2 bonus for Tiny size).
  \par The weapon that you get is usually a force replica of any weapon from your deity's weapon group. A cleric without a deity gets a weapon based on his alignment. A neutral cleric without a deity can create a spiritual weapon of any alignment, provided he is acting at least generally in accord with that alignment at the time. The weapon groups associated with each alignment are as follows.
  \par Chaos: Axes
  \par Evil: Flexible weapons
  \par Good: Headed weapons
  \par Law: Heavy blades

  \par The bison are summoned in a place that you designate within the spell's area, with each creature being summoned in the closest free space to the point of origin. If there is insufficient room for all of the bison to appear while standing on stable ground, the spell will summon fewer bison than the maximum. The herd of bison always moves directly away from you, trampling anything of Large size or smaller that gets in their way. If the herd is thinned to fewer than 5 bison, they stop stampeding and scatter in random directions.
  \par The bison do not attack, even if cornered; they will only stampede. At the end of the spell's duration, the bison disappear.

  This spell creates an enormous black storm cloud. Lightning and crashing claps of thunder appear within the storm. You make a Fortitude attack to deafen each creature beneath the cloud for 5 minutes. Violent rain and wind gusts obscure all sight beyond 100 feet. A creature less than 100 feet away has concealment (\plus4 to physical defenses). Ranged attacks within the area of the storm take a \minus4 penalty, and spells cast within the area are disrupted unless the caster succeeds on a Concentration check against a DC equal to 20 \add double the level of the spell.
  \par If you do not maintain concentration on the spell after casting it, the spell ends. If you continue to concentrate, the spell generates new effects in each following round, as noted below. Each effect occurs during your turn.
  \par 2nd Round: Acid rains down, dealing 1d10 acid damage to everything in the area.
  \par 3rd Round: You call three bolts of lightning down from the cloud. You decide where the bolts strike. No two bolts may strike the same target. Each bolt deals 9d6 electricity damage \add d6 per four levels above 18th. You make a Reflex attack to deal damage to each creature in the path of the bolt. A failed attack deals half damage. If you do not direct the lightning bolts, each bolt automatically targets the largest available target in the area.

  You influence the actions of the target creature by suggesting a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two). The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do some obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell. Additionally, any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the fascinated creature, grants the creature a new saving throw with a \plus5 bonus.
  \par The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell duration expires, the activity is not performed.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  A very reasonable suggestion can grant a \plus2 or greater bonus on the Will attack. A creature that resists this spell is immune to all further attempts by the same spellcaster for 24 hours.

  This spell summons an extraplanar creature (typically an outsider, elemental, or magical beast native to another plane). It appears where you designate and acts on your next turn. You must spend a swift action each round to control the creature summoned by this spell. If you do, it attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. You can direct the creature not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions if you can communicate with it. If you do not actively control the creature summoned by this spell, it acts according to its nature.
  \par When you learn this spell, you choose two creatures from the 1st-level list on \tref{Summon Monster List}. You can summon those creatures with this or any other summon monster spell.

  In addition, you make a Will attack against the touched creature. A successful attack causes the subject to be placed into a state of suspended animation. For the creature, time ceases to flow and its condition becomes fixed. The creature does not grow older. Its body functions virtually cease, and no force or effect can harm it. This state persists until the magic is removed (such as by a successful \spell{dispel magic} spell or an \spell{emancipation} spell).
\end{spellblood}

    A slowed creature can take only a single move action or standard action each turn, but not both. It cannot take full-round actions, but it may take swift actions. Additionally, it takes a \minus2 penalty to physical attacks and defenses, as well as Strength and Dexterity-based checks.

  This spell seems to make time cease to flow for everyone but you. In fact, you step into an alternate timestream, causing you to speed up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen, though they are actually still moving at their normal speeds. You are free to act for 1d3\plus1 rounds of apparent time. You are still \vulnerable to danger, such as from heat or dangerous gases, but your actions have no effect on anything in the world other than yourself. Objects and creatures appear frozen in place. You cannot cast spells that affect any targets except yourself; the temporal magic is too strong to permit interference from lesser magic, and attempts to cast magic beyond the accelerated time surrounding you simply fail. The only exception is for temporal spells, which can be cast normally inside a \spell{time stop}. The subjects are not affected and do not attempt to resist the effects until the end of the \spell{time stop}, so you do not know whether they are affected by any spells you cast until the effect has expired.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  Most spellcasters use the additional time to improve their defenses or flee from combat. You are undetectable while \spell{time stop} lasts. You cannot enter an area protected by an \spell{antimagic field} while under the effect of \spell{time stop}.

  This spell has different effects depending on the version chosen.
  \par \subspell{Flesh to Stone} The subject is slowed for the duration of the spell, and takes 3d8 physical damage each round as its body gradually turns to stone. If the subject reaches 0 hit points before the spell ends, it becomes a mindless, inert statue, along with all its carried gear. If the statue resulting from this effect is broken or damaged, the subject (if ever returned to its original state) has similar damage or deformities. The creature is not dead, but it is not considered alive either.
  \par Only creatures made of flesh are affected by this effect.
  \par \subspell{Stone to Flesh} This effect restores a petrified creature to its normal state, restoring life and goods. Any petrified creature, regardless of size, can be restored. A restored creature has as many hit points as it had when it was petrified. Stone which was not originally a petrified creature is unaffected.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
A slowed creature can take only a single move action or standard action each turn, but not both. It cannot take full-round actions, but it may take swift actions. Additionally, it takes a \minus2 penalty to physical attacks and defenses, as well as Strength and Dexterity-based checks.

The closest inspection cannot reveal that the tree in question is actually a magically concealed creature. To all normal tests you are, in fact, a tree or shrub, although a Spellcraft check can reveal a faint transmutation on the tree. While in tree form, you can observe all that transpires around you just as if you were in your normal form, and your hit points and defenses remain unaffected. You gain a \plus10 enhancement bonus to your armor modifier, but you have an effective Dexterity score of \minus10 and cannot move. You are immune to critical hits while in tree form.

This damage does not require an attakc, and is dealt at the start of each of your turns after you create the wall.

\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell forms a wall of stone atop existing rock surfaces. A wall of stone is 4 inches thick and composed of up to ten 5-foot squares. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
  \par You can create a wall of stone in almost any shape you desire. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell's area by half. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area.
  \par Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a \spell{disintegrate} spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 15 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 8. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 \add 2 per inch of thickness.

  This spell creates a barrier of very tough, pliable, tangled brush bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a human's finger. Any creature forced into or attempting to move through a wall of thorns takes slashing damage per square of movement equal to twice your caster level, minus the creature's Armor defense.
  \par You can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall as twenty 10\mult10\mult5 foot blocks. This has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier.
  \par Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a grapple attack or Escape Artist check as a full-round action. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 20, up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land speed. Of course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as described above. A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage.
  \par If you have at least 5 feet of thorns between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of thorns between you, it provides total cover.
  \par Any creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and is caught inside. In order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free, or it can wait until the spell ends. Creatures with the ability to pass throughs overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a wall of thorns at normal speed without taking damage.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  A \spell{wall of thorn} can be breached by slow work with edged weapons or fire. It has hardness 8 and 30 hit points per square foot of thickness.
  \par Despite its appearance, a \spell{wall of thorns} is not actually a living plant, and thus is unaffected by spells that affect plants.

\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
  You cause wood to bend and warp, permanently destroying its straightness, form, and strength. A warped door springs open (or becomes stuck, requiring a Strength check to open, at your option). A boat or ship springs a leak. Warped ranged weapons are useless. A warped melee weapon imposes a \minus4 penalty on physical attacks.
  \par You may warp one Small or smaller object or its equivalent per caster level. A Medium object counts as two Small objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as sixteen, and a Colossal object as thirty-two.
  \par Alternatively, you can unwarp wood (effectively warping it back to normal) with this spell, straightening wood that has been warped by this spell or by other means. \spellindirect{make whole}{Make whole}, on the other hand, does no good in repairing a warped item.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  You can combine multiple consecutive \spell{warp wood} spells to warp (or unwarp) an object that is too large for you to warp with a single spell. Until the object is completely warped, it suffers no ill effects.

  The transmuted creatures can tread on any liquid as if it were firm ground. Mud, oil, snow, quicksand, running water, ice, and even lava can be traversed easily, since the subjects' feet hover an inch or two above the surface. (Creatures crossing molten lava still take damage from the heat because they are near it.) The subjects can move across the surface as if it were normal ground.
  \par If the spell is cast underwater (or while the subjects are partially or wholly submerged in whatever liquid they are in), the subjects are borne toward the surface at 60 feet per round until they can stand on it.

    You make a Fortitude attack to exhaust all creatures in the area. A failed attack means they are fatigued instead. This spell has no effect on a creature that is already exhausted.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    An exhausted character cannot sprint or charge, moves at half speed, and takes a \minus4 penalty to attacks, defenses, and checks. A fatigued character can neither sprint nor charge and is \vulnerable, giving it a \minus2 penalty to attacks, defenses, and checks.

\spelldef{Reflex negates; see text}
\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
    You make a Reflex attack to entangle all creatures in the area. This attack is repeated each round that a creature moves or fights within the area. An entangled creature can spend a standard action to make a grapple attack or Escape Artist attempt against your Reflex attack to break the webs holding it, preventing it from being entangled. A creature entangled by the spell remains entangled until it breaks the webs holding it or escapes the spell's area.
  \par If the strands can be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed structures, such as walls, the strands are much more sturdy. A creature entangled within a sturdy web is unable to move from its square until it stops being entangled.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  An entangled creature moves at half speed, cannot sprint or charge, and takes a \minus2 penalty to physical attacks and defenses, as well as Strength and Dexterity-based checks. If it attempts to cast a spell must make a Concentration check (DC 10 \add double the spell's level) or lose the spell.
  The strands are too widely spaced to significantly obscure sight, but are flammable. A magic flaming sword can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire can set the webs alight and burn away 5 square feet in 1 round. All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames.
  
  This spell can be made permanent with a \spell{permanency} ritual. A permanent \spell{web} that is destroyed regrows in 10 minutes.

\begin{spelleffect}
  This spell is the mightiest spell a wizard or sorcerer can cast. By simply speaking your desires aloud, you can alter reality to better suit you.
  \par Even wish, however, has its limits.
  \par A wish can produce any one of the following effects.
  \begin{itemize*}
    \item Duplicate any general wizard or sorcerer spell of 8th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.
    \item Duplicate any general wizard or sorcerer spell of 7th level or lower even if it's of a prohibited school.
    \item Duplicate any other spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.
    \item Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower even if it's of a prohibited school. 
    \item Undo the harmful effects of many other spells, such as geas/quest or insanity.
    \item Create a nonmagical item of up to 10,000 gp in value.
    \item Create a magic item, or add to the powers of an existing magic item.
    \item Remove injuries and afflictions. A single wish can aid one creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction. For example, you could heal all the damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same wish. A wish can never restore the experience point loss from casting a spell or the level or Constitution loss from being raised from the dead.
    \item Revive the dead. A wish can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a resurrection spell. A wish can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two wishes, one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again. A wish cannot prevent a character who was brought back to life from losing an experience level.
    \item Transport travelers. A wish can lift one creature per caster level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. You must make a Will attack to affect unwilling targets.
    \item Undo misfortune. A wish can undo a single recent event. The wish forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish could undo a foe's successful critical hit (either the attack roll or the critical roll), a friend's failed attack, and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. You must make a Will attack to affect an unwilling target.
  \end{itemize*}
  \par When casting a wish, you do not specify the exact spell or effect you wish to duplicate. Instead, you make a wish, describing what you want to have happen, and make a DC 20 Wisdom check. If the check fails, your intent is redirected or perverted in some way. For example, a wish to turn a foe to stone would normally mimic the flesh to stone effect of the transmute flesh and stone spell. However, if the Wisdom check failed, your foe might gain the benefit of a \spell{stoneskin} spell instead.
  \par You may try to use a wish to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. The DC of the Wisdom check increases to 25, and the negative consequences for failing the check increase in proportion to the potency of the effect you try to create.
