\spelldur{\durshort}
\spelleffect Each animated object immediately attacks whomever or whatever you initially designate. Your control of the objects is limited to simple commands (``Attack,'' ``Defend,'' ``Stop,'' and so forth).
\par An animated object can be of any nonmagical material. You may animate one Small or smaller object or an equivalent number of larger objects per caster level. A Medium object counts as two Small or smaller objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as sixteen, and a Colossal object as thirty-two. You can give the objects new commands as a move action, as normal for directing an active spell.

\spellzone{\areasmall radius centered on you} 
\spelldur{\durlong \dismissable}
\spellline
\spelleffect Living creatures cannot enter the spell's area. Nonliving creatures, such as constructs and undead, suffer no ill effect.
\spellnotes Barrier spells may be used only defensively, not aggressively. Creatures in the area at the time that the spell is cast are unaffected by the spell.
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}

\spellsection{Antimagic Field}{7}
\spelldesc{You create a mobile, spherical energy field that suppresses magic.}
\spellinfo{Abjur (Negation) [Magic]}{Abjur, Divine, Magic}
\spellemanation{\areasmall radius centered on you}
\spelldur{\durlong \dismissable}
\spellline
\spelleffect All spells, spell-like abilities, supernatural abilities, and magic items fail to function in the area of this spell. They cannot be activated from within the field, and any existing effects brought into or cast into the area are suppressed. Time spent within an \spell{antimagic field} counts against a suppressed spell's duration.
\par Summoned creatures of any type and incorporeal undead disappear if they enter an \spell{antimagic field}. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations, such as \spell{create water}, are not affected by an \spell{antimagic field} because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result.)
\par Creatures within an \spell{antimagic field} cannot dismiss spells. However, you can dismiss your own antimagic field.
\spellnotes A normal creature can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically in the area, it is still a sword. The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned.
\par \spell{Dispel magic} does not remove the field. Two or more \spell{antimagic fields} sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as \spell{wall of force}, \spell{prismatic sphere}, and \spell{prismatic wall}, remain unaffected by \spell{antimagic field} (see the individual spell descriptions).
\par Any part of a creature that lies outside the field is unaffected by the field.
\par Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. 

\spellsection{Aqueous Blade}{2}

\spellinfo{Trans (Alteration) [Water]}{Nature, Water}
\spellrng{\rngclose}
\spelldur{\durshort \dismissable}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelltarget}{One weapon}[Magic vs. Will]
    \spellsuccess Attacks with the affected weapon are made against Reflex defense instead of Armor defense. However, damage with the weapon is halved, including any bonuses to damage.
\end{spelltarget}

\spellsection{Assimilate}{9}
\spelldesc{Your pointing finger turns black as obsidian. You touch a creature and it dissolves into dust as you assimilate its form into your own body.}
\spellinfo{Necro/Trans (Augment, Life)}{Arcane, Evil}
\spellrng{\rngtouch}
\spelldur{Instantaneous and one hour; see text}
\spellsr{Yes (Fortitude)}
\begin{spelltarget}{One living creature}[Magic vs. Fortitude]
    \spellsuccess 18d8 life damage \add d6 per four caster levels above 18th. 
    \spellfailure As above, but half damage.
    \spelleffect If the target has no hit points remaining after taking damage from this spell, it is entirely assimilated into your form, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. An assimilated creature's equipment is unaffected.
    \par If the creature has at least 1 hit point following your use of this power, you gain temporary hit points equal to half the damage you dealt for 1 hour.
    \par If the creature is completely assimilated, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the damage you dealt and a \plus4 enhancement bonus to each of your attributes for 1 hour. In addition, you gain the appearance of the creature for 1 hour, granting you a \plus10 enhancement bonus on Disguise checks made to appear as that creature during that time.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes If you take life damage, you lose all temporary hit points provided by this spell before applying the damage.

\spellsection{Aversion}{3}
\spelldesc{You make the subject want to avoid something.}
\spellinfo{Ench (Emotion) [Mind-Affecting]}{Ench}
\spellrng{\rngmed}
\spelldur{\durshort}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelltarget}{One creature}[Magic vs. Will]
    \spellsuccess The target feels an aversion to a particular person or object. If the object of the implanted aversion is an individual or a physical object, she will prefer not to approach within 30 feet of it. If it is a word, she will try not to utter it; if it is an action, she will not willingly attempt to perform it; and if it is an event, she will not willingly attend it. The target will take reasonable steps to avoid the object of its aversion, but will not put herself in jeopardy by doing so.
    \par If the target is unable to avoid the object of her aversion, she takes a \minus4 penalty to attacks, defenses, and checks for 1 round.

\begin{spelltargets}{One extraplanar creature}[Magic vs. Will]
    \spellsuccess The target is banished, as \spell{dismissal}.
\end{spelltargets}
\spelleffect As long as you concentrate on this spell, you can attack a new target each round. An individual creature can only be targeted once per casting of this spell.
\spellnotes You can improve the spell's chance of success by presenting at least one object or substance that the target hates, fears, or otherwise opposes. For each such object or substance, you gain a \plus2 bonus on your caster level with the spell. For example, if this spell were cast on a demon that hated light and was \vulnerable to holy water and cold iron weapons, you might use iron, holy water, and a torch in the spell. The three items would give you a \plus6 bonus on your caster level. 
\par Certain rare items might work twice as well as a normal item for the purpose of the bonuses (each providing a \plus4 bonus to your caster level).
\spellfocus{Any item that is distasteful to the target (optional, see above)}

        \item \minus4 penalty on attacks, defenses, and checks.
        \item Each turn, the target has a 25\% chance to take no action; otherwise, it acts normally.
    \end{itemize}
    \par You may also invent your own curse, but it should be no more powerful than those described above.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes Curses cannot be dispelled.

\spellsection{Black Tentacles}{7}
\spelldesc{You conjure a field of rubbery black tentacles, each 5 feet long. These waving members seem to spring forth from the earth, floor, or whatever surface is underfoot -- including water.

    \spelleffect You ``blink" back and forth between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. This has several effects, as follows.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item All attacks made against you and spells targeted on you have a 50\% chance to fail. This failure chance is reduced to 20\% if the attack can strike ethereal targets or if the attacker can see ethereal targets. If both are true, the attack suffers no chance of failure. Force effects can strike ethereal targets.
        \item You take half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane).
        \item You take half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.
        \item All of your attacks and spells have a 20\% chance to happen while you are in the Ethereal Plane, which usually means they have no effect.
        \item You can move at only three-quarters speed (because movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed, and you spend about half your time there and half your time material.)
        \item You can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50\% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 damage per 5 feet so traveled.

    \spelleffect Other creatures take a \minus2 penalty on sight-based checks and physical attacks against the target, such as on Perception and Sense Motive checks.

\spelleffect Your staff turns into a creature that looks and fights just like a treant. The staff-treant defends you and obeys any spoken commands. However, it is by no means a true treant; it cannot converse with actual treants or control trees.

If the staff-treant is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it crumbles to powder and the staff is destroyed. Otherwise, the staff returns to its normal form when the spell duration expires (or when the spell is dismissed), and it can be used as the focus for another casting of the spell. The staff-treant is always at full strength when created, despite any wounds it may have incurred the last time it appeared.

    \par The spell does not enable you to control the subject as if it were an automaton, but it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must succeed at a Persuasion check to convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) Treat the target as a friend (a \plus10 relationship modifier) for the purpose of the Persuasion check. An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing.

\spelleffect Depending on the version you choose, this spell raises or lowers water.
\par \subspell{Lower Water} This causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by as much as 2 feet per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch). The water is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides are up to caster level \mtimes 10 feet long. In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell.
\par \subspell{Raise Water} This causes water or similar liquid to rise in height, just as the lower water version causes it to lower. Boats raised in this way slide down the sides of the hump that the spell creates. If the area affected by the spell includes riverbanks, a beach, or other land nearby, the water can spill over onto dry land.

\spelleffect This spell creates a volume of sound within the area, as determined by you. As a standard action, you can concentrate to alter the sound within the area.
\par The volume of sound created depends on your caster level. You can produce as much noise as two normal humans per caster level. Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The noise can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit, including speech. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from sixteen humans, while a roaring dire tiger is equal to the noise from twenty humans.

By concentrating on an aura (a standard action), you can determine the strength of the aura. Most aligned creatures and magic items have a faint aura. Creatures that embody the alignment (such as undead and outsiders with an aligned creature subtype) have a moderate aura. Creatures that act directly on behalf of the alignment (such as paladins and some clerics), and exceptionally potent aligned magic items (primarily artifacts) have a strong aura.
\spellnotes Each round, you can turn to detect objects in a new area. A detection spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

    \par When used against an object, the ray simply disintegrates as much as one 10-foot cube of nonliving matter. Thus, the spell disintegrates only part of any very large object or structure targeted.

\spellspecial This spell has two versions: a targeted dispel, and an area dispel. Its effects depend on which version is chosen.
\begin{spelltarget}{One creature or object}[Caster level vs. Special]
    \spelleffect For every spell affecting the target, if the attack result beats a DC equal to 10 \add the caster level of the spell, it is dispelled.

    If the target is an object, and the attack result beats a DC equal to 10 \add the caster level of the object, the object is suppressed for 5 rounds. A suppressed object loses all its magical abilities, though it is still treated as being a magical object for the purpose of spells and effects.

    If the target is an effect of an ongoing spell (such as a summoned creature), and the attack result beats a DC equal to 10 \add the caster level of the spell, the target is treated as if the spell that created it was dispelled. This usually causes the target to disappear.
\end{spelltarget}

\spellline
\spellburst{\areamed radius}
\begin{spelltargets}*{All creatures and unattended objects in the area}l[Caster level vs. Special]
    \spelleffect If the attack result beats a DC equal to 10 \add the caster level of the highest level spell on the target, that effect is dispelled. If there are multiple spells of the same level, choose one randomly.
\end{spelltargets}

\spellnotes A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. If a spell affects multiple targets, it must be dispelled individually on each target. Dispelling the effect on one target does not affect the other targets of the spell.

Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be dispelled by this spell. A spell without a duration cannot be dispelled, even if it has a lasting effect.

You may choose to automatically succeed or fail on your attack against any spell that you cast yourself.

Spell-like abilities are treated like spells, and this spell affects them in the same way it affects spells.

Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.

\spellrng{\rngmed}
\spelldur{One day}
\begin{spelltarget}{One humanoid creature}[Magic vs. Will]
    \spellsuccess You can control the actions of the target through a telepathic link that you establish with the subject's mind.
    \par If you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as ``Come here," ``Go there," ``Fight," and ``Stand still." If you concentrate on the spell, you know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically.
    \par Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth). Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill description).
    It takes time for the link to be established. For the first hour after the spell is cast, you must concentrate on the spell (a standard action) to control the subject's actions. While you are not concentrating on the spell, the creature acts as if confused, as the \spell{confusion} spell, except that it never attacks you. If the subject would randomly attack you, it instead is forced to follow your commands. At the end of the hour, you must make a second Will attack. If you concentrate on the spell during this time, you gain a \plus4 bonus to the attack. If your attack succeeds, you dominate the creature fully for the remainder of the spell duration. Otherwise, the creature is freed.
    \par After the first hour, changing your instructions or giving a dominated creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.
    \par By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can't communicate with you. You can't actually see through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on.
    \par Subjects resist this control, and you must make a new attack to force the subject to take an action against its nature. Failure means it breaks free. This does not apply when a subject is merely ordered to perform an action it disagrees with -- the action must be directly opposed to the subject's beliefs. Ordering a paladin to murder an innocent would require a new attack, but ordering him to build a bridge that would allow an evil army to cross a river would not. If your command would obviously lead to the creature's death, your attack takes a \minus10 penalty. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control it.
    \par If you recast this spell on a subject you have dominated before it escapes your control, you can extend the duration of the spell indefinitely. You do not need to make a new attack when you renew your control in this fashion.

The temporary hit points disappear after 1 hour. If you take life damage, you lose all temporary hit points provided by this spell before applying the damage.

    As long as you have temporary hit points from this spell, you are treated as being undead for the purpose of spells or abilities which affect undead. This can cause some unintelligent undead, such as skeletons and zombies, to avoid attacking you.

\begin{spelltarget}{One humanoid creature (Huge or smaller)}l[Magic vs. Fortitude]
    \spelleffect The target instantly grows, doubling its height and multiplying its weight by 8. This increase changes the creature's size category to the next larger one. This has several effects.
    \begin{itemize} 
        \item \plus10 ft. bonus to movement speed.
        \item \plus4 bonus to maneuver attack and defense.
        \item \minus1 penalty to other physical attacks and defenses.
        \item \minus2 penalty to Dexterity.
        \item \plus2 enhancement bonus to Strength.
        \item \minus4 penalty to Stealth checks.
    \end{itemize}
    \par A typical humanoid creature whose size increases to Large has a space of 10 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet.
    \par If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it -- the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size.
    \par All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly enlarged by the spell. Melee and projectile weapons affected by this spell deal more damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any enlarged item that leaves an enlarged creature's possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage, and projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them. Magical properties of enlarged items are not increased by this spell.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack. This spell can be made permanent with a \spell{permanency} ritual.

    \spelleffect You become ethereal, along with your equipment. For the duration of the spell, you are in a place called the Ethereal Plane, which overlaps the normal, physical, Material Plane. When the spell expires, you return to material existence.
    \par An ethereal creature is invisible, insubstantial, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down, albeit at half normal speed. As an insubstantial creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear on the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and ephemeral. Sight and hearing onto the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.
    \par Force effects and abjurations affect an ethereal creature normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane (such as a basilisk's gaze attack). Treat other ethereal creatures and ethereal objects as if they were material. 
    \par If you end the spell and become material while inside a material object (such as a solid wall), you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 damage per 5 feet that you so travel.

It gains physical damage reduction, reducing the physical damage it takes each round by 15 \add 2 per caster level above 6th. If it takes damage from a spell or magic weapon, it cannot use its damage reduction for 1 round. It becomes immune to critical hits.
    
    The target can't attack or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material, or focus components while in gaseous form. If it has a touch spell ready to use, that spell is discharged harmlessly when the gaseous form spell takes effect.
    \par A gaseous creature can fly at a speed of 10 feet (special maneuverability). It can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with all it was wearing or holding in its hands, as long as the spell persists. The creature is subject to the effects of wind, and it can't enter water or other liquid. It also can't manipulate objects or activate items, even those carried along with its gaseous form.

\begin{spelltarget}{Up to three vermin in the area}
    \spelleffect You turn three normal-sized centipedes, two normal-sized spiders, or a single normal-sized scorpion into Large-sized forms. Only one type of vermin can be transmuted (so a single casting cannot affect both a centipede and a spider), and all must be grown to the same size.
    \par Any giant vermin created by this spell do not attempt to harm you, but your control of such creatures is limited to simple commands (``Attack," ``Defend," ``Stop," and so forth).

\spelleffect This spell creates a floating, disembodied hand made of magical force. Each round, as a swift action, you can direct the hand to protect you from a target. If you do not direct the hand, it remains motionless.

The hand is 10 feet long and about that wide with its fingers outstretched. It has 3 hit points per caster level, an Armor defense of 10 \add half your caster level, and a Maneuver defense of 10 \add your caster level \add your casting attribute. Most effects that don't affect objects do not affect the hand.

\begin{spelltarget}*{One creature}
    \spelleffect The hand provides you with active cover from the target. Each physical attack the target makes against you has a 20\% chance to strike the hand instead. In addition, if the target is Large size or smaller, it moves at half speed while moving towards you.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes The hand can move up to 60 feet per round. It never provokes attacks of opportunity from opponents.

    \par You are immune to blindness, critical hits, attribute damage, deafness, disease, drowning, electricity, poison, stunning, and all spells or attacks that affect your physiology or respiration, because you have no physiology or respiration while this spell is in effect. You take only half damage from acid and fire of all kinds.
    \par You gain a \plus5 enhancement bonus to your Strength score, but you take a \minus5 penalty to Dexterity as well, and your speed is reduced to half normal. You have a \minus8 armor check penalty. You cannot drink (and thus can't use potions) or play wind instruments.
    \par Your unarmed attacks deal damage equal to a warhammer sized for you (1d6 for Small characters or 1d8 for Medium characters), and you are considered armed when making unarmed attacks.

If the target object is stuck or held, you can immediately make an Strength check to break it open, using your caster level instead of your Strength. Others can aid you on this check as normal. In addition, if the target object is locked, you can immediately make a Disable Device check to open the lock as if you had rolled a 20 on the check. You get an enhancement bonus on the Disable Device check equal to half your caster level.

As a swift action, you can mentally direct the subject to move up or down as much as 20 feet each round.

\spelleffect A limited wish lets you create nearly any type of effect. For example, a limited wish can do any of the following things.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Duplicate any general sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.
    \item Duplicate any general sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th level or lower, even if it's of a prohibited school.
    \item Duplicate any other spell of 4th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.
    \item Duplicate any other spell of 3rd level or lower, even if it's of a prohibited school.
    \item Undo the harmful effects of many spells, such as geas/quest or insanity.
    \item Produce any other effect whose power level is in line with the above effects, such as a single creature automatically hitting on its next attack or taking a \minus5 penalty to its defenses for 5 rounds.
\end{itemize}
\par When casting a limited wish, you do not specify the exact spell or effect you wish to duplicate. Instead, you make a wish, describing what you want to have happen, and make a DC 15 Wisdom check. If the check fails, your intent is redirected or perverted in some way. For example, a \spell{limited wish} to turn a foe to stone would normally mimic the \spell{flesh to stone} effect of the \spell{transmute flesh and stone} spell. However, if the Wisdom check failed, your foe might gain the benefit of a \spell{stoneskin} spell instead.
\par When a limited wish spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 1,000 gp, you must provide that component (in addition to the 1,000 gp cost for this spell).

You can search for general creatures based on visual characteristics (such as ``pointy ears'' or ``looking human''), in which case you locate the nearest one of its kind if more than one is within the range. Attempting to find a certain creature requires a specific and accurate mental image of a distinguishing visual characteristic, such as its clothes or face; if the image is not close enough to the actual creature, the spell fails.

    \spelleffect As you cast this spell, you choose whether to create body armor or a shield. If you choose body armor, the target gains a \plus2 armor modifier. If you choose a shield, the subject gains a \plus2 shield modifier. The bonus granted increases to \plus3 at 8th caster level, to \plus4 at 14th caster level, and finally to \plus5 at 20th caster level. 
    \par Unlike mundane armor, \spell{mage armor} entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction.
    \par If you are the target, this spell lasts for \durlong duration. On any other creature, it lasts for \durshort duration.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes If you cast this spell on the same creature twice, you can grant the creature both body armor and a shield. The armor created by this spell is treated as a separate piece or armor from any other armor the creature is wearing, so it does not stack with any existing bonuses. Since \spell{mage armor} is made of force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor.

    \spellfailure The target item is suppressed for 5 rounds. A suppressed object loses all its magical abilities, though it is still treated as being a magical object for the purpose of spells and effects.

    \spelleffect You can meld your body and possessions into a single block of stone. The stone must be large enough to accommodate your body in all three dimensions. When the casting is complete, you and not more than 100 pounds of nonliving gear merge with the stone. If either condition is violated, the spell fails and is wasted.
    \par While in the stone, you remain in contact, however tenuous, with the face of the stone through which you melded. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while hiding in the stone. Nothing that goes on outside the stone can be seen, but you can still hear what happens around you. Minor physical damage to the stone does not harm you, but its partial destruction (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. If the stone is completely destroyed, you are expelled, and you die unless your Fortitude defense is at least 20.
    \par At any time before the duration expires, you can step out of the stone through the surface that you entered. If the spell's duration expires or the effect is dispelled before you voluntarily exit the stone, you are violently expelled and take 5d6 points of damage.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes The following spells harm you if cast upon the stone that you are occupying: \spell{transmute flesh and stone} expels you and deals 6d6 points of damage. \spellindirect{shape stone}{Shape stone} deals 3d6 points of damage but does not expel you. \spell{Passwall} expels you without damage.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Duplicate any cleric spell of 8th level or lower (including spells to which you have access because of your domains). 
    \item Duplicate any other spell of 7th level or lower.
    \item Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as feeblemind or insanity.
    \item Have any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.
\end{itemize}
\par Alternatively, a cleric can make a very powerful request. Examples of especially powerful miracles of this sort could include the following.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Swiinging the tide of a battle in your favor by raising fallen allies to continue fighting.
    \item Moving you and your allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to another through planar barriers to a specific locale with no chance of error.
    \item Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster.
\end{itemize}
\par In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity's (or alignment's) nature is refused.
\spellnotes If you request a miracle, your deity (or the power you pray to) will expect something of you in return. You must cast \spell{commune}commune to learn what this is within 24 hours, or you will lose the ability to cast any cleric spells other than \spell{commune}. For more moderate miracles, you may be required to offer 25,000gp worth of incense and gems. For especially powerful miracles, or multiple moderate miracles, you may geased with a task to complete.

Typically, this means the subject moves in a random direction each round to escape the maze.

    If the target encounters any physical resistance in its movements or takes any damage, you must make another attack to maintain the effect. Failure means the target disbelieves the phantasm, ending the spell.

\par As a swift action, you can attune to the projected image. This has several effects.
\begin{itemize}
    \item You see and hear from the image's location, rather from where your body is.
    \item Any spells you cast originate from the image instead of from you. This causes you to measure range, line of effect, and so on from the image's location, rather than from your location.
    \item You can control the image's actions independently from your own actions. Each round, it can move up to 100 feet in any direction, including vertically.
\end{itemize}

As a free action, you can stop attuning to the projected image.

\spellnotes You must maintain line of effect to the projected image at all times. If your line of effect is obstructed, the spell ends. If you teleport or use a similar effect that breaks your line of effect, even momentarily, the spell ends.

Such creatures are visible as translucent shapes, allowing the target to easily discern the difference between visible, invisible, and ethereal creatures.

\spellsection{Shadow Body}{7}
\spellinfo{Illus/Trans (Polymorph, Shadow)}{Arcane}
\spelldur{\durmed \dismissable}
\begin{spelltarget}{You}
    \spelleffect Your body and all your equipment are subsumed by your shadow. As a living shadow, you blend perfectly into any other shadow and vanish in darkness. You appear as an unattached shadow in areas of full light.
    \par You can move at your normal speed, on any surface, including walls and ceilings, as well as across the surfaces of liquids -- even up the face of a waterfall.
    \par You become perfectly flat, potentially allowing you to move into locations you would not normally be able to move into.
    \par While in your shadow body, you gain physical damage reduction, reducing the physical damage you take each round by 14 \add 1 per caster level above 14th. If you take solar damage, you cannot use your damage reduction for 1 round. You are immune to ability damage, disease, drowning, and poison. You take only half damage from energy attacks (acid, cold, electricity, and fire).
    \par While affected by this spell, you can be detected by spells that read thoughts, life, or presences (including true seeing), or if you make suspicious movements in lighted areas.
    \par You cannot harm anyone physically or manipulate any objects, but you can use your spells normally. Doing so may attract notice, but if you remain in a shadowed area, you get a \plus15 enhancement bonus on your Hide check to remain unnoticed.

\spellsection{Shadow Puppet}{9}
\spellinfo{Conj/Illus (Shadow, Translocation) [Planar, Unreal]}{Illus}
\spelldur{\durmed}
\spellline
\spelleffect You step into the Plane of Shadow, as \spell{shadow walk}. At the same time, you create a quasi-real version of yourself, as \spell{project image}. The duplicate image appears superimposed over your body so that observers don't notice an image appearing and you disappearing. You can then control the image and cast spells through it even though you are on a different plane.
\spellnotes If the image moves farther than \rnglong range away from where it was originally created, or if you leave the Plane of Shadow, the image ceases to exist.

\spellsection{Shadow Umbra}{8}

\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelltarget}{One creature}
    \spelleffect All attacks that would affect the creature, including magical and supernatural attacks, have a 50\% chance to be absorbed by the umbra. Attacks absorbed by the umbra have no effect on the subject. The umbra is selective, and does not inhibit beneficial effects.

    Whenever the umbra absorbs an attack, it alters the creature's appearance (including smell, sound, and other senses, as appropriate) with a glamer. This causes the creature to seem as if were affected by the attack. Outside observers have no way of knowing which attacks were absorbed by the umbra unless they can recognize the illusion. The spell does not attempt to mimic the effects of extraordinary attacks which cannot be disguised, such as attacks which would destroy the creature's body.

\begin{spelltargets}{You and one willing creature}
    \spelleffect This spell creates a connection between you and a willing target. As you cast the spell, you decide which creature will be protected. When the protected creature would take damage to its hit points, it instead takes half of that damage (rounded down), and you lose hit points equal to the other half of the damage (rounded up).

    If the target is out of range of you, the effect is suppressed until it returns within the range.
\end{spelltargets}
\spellnotes The loss of hit points caused by this spell is not damage, and is not affected by damage reduction or other abilities which affect damage. When this spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between the subject and you, but damage already shared is not reassigned.

    \par At the end of each round, all lawful creatures within \rngclose range of the target that attacked it with their body or a melee weapon that round take 4d6 points of damage. A creature that attacks multiple creatures shielded by this spell can take this damage multiple times.

\spellsection{Shrink Item}{3}
\spellinfo{Trans (Alteration)}{Trans}
\spellrng{\rngclose}
\spelldur{24 hours or until discharged}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\spellspecial As you cast this spell, choose a command word.
\begin{spelltarget}{One nonmagical object (Medium or smaller; see text)}l[Magic vs. Will]
    \spellsuccess The target shrinks to 1/16 of its normal size in each dimension (to about 1/4,000 the original volume and mass). This change effectively reduces its size by four size categories. If the target is physically unable to shrink, such as a ring on a finger, it shrinks as much as it can without causing harm to itself or the physical impediment.

    As a standard action, any creature can speak the command word to return the target to its original size. It must be resting on a stable surface. If the command word is spoken while the target is not stable, such as while it is in the air, it returns to its original size as soon as it finds a resting point. Restoring the target to its normal size ends the spell.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes This spell can normally target an object of up to Medium size. You can shrink a Large object at 10th caster level, a Huge object at 16th caster level, or a Gargantuan object at 24th caster level.
\par This spell can be made permanent with a \spell{permanency} ritual, in which case the affected object can be shrunk and expanded an indefinite number of times, but only by the original caster. If you recast the spell each day on an object, you can keep it at its small size indefinitely.

\spellsection{Silence}{2}
\spellinfo{Illus (Glamer)}{Divine, Trickery}
\spellrng{\rngmed}
\spelldur{\durshort \dismissable}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelltarget}{One creature or object}[Magic vs. Will]
    \spelleffect The target becomes unable to make noise. Any noises it makes are inaudible to other creatures. When you cast the spell, you may choose whether the subject can still hear itself normally, potentially causing it to be unaware of the effect of the spell.

    Extraordinarily loud noises, such as the yell of a giant, are merely muffled by the spell rather than completely silenced. The DC to hear such sounds produced by the subject is increased by 40. Sonic attacks function normally.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes Spellcasters unable to hear themselves cast are treated as deafened, and suffer a 20\% chance of spell failure when casting spells with verbal components.

\spellsection{Silent Image}{2}
\spellinfo{Illus (Figment) [Unreal]}{Illus}
\spelltwocol{\spellzone{\areamed radius}}{\spellrng{\rngmed}}
\spelldur{\durshort}
\spellline
\spelleffect This spell creates the visual illusion of an object, creature, or force within the area, as determined by you. The illusion does not create sound, smell, texture, or temperature. As a standard action, you can concentrate to alter the image within the area.
\spellnotes Creatures can recognize the figment as unreal by interacting with it physically, or by making a Perception check against a DC equal to 10 \add half your caster level \add your casting attribute. A creature gets a \plus10 bonus on this Perception check when using senses which should be present in the figment, but which are missing.

A creature faced with definitive proof that the figment is unreal can disbelieve it, treating it as if it were not there.

\spellsection{Skysmite}{6}

\spellrng{\rngext}
\spellburst{\arealarge vertical line of lightning, 5 ft. wide}
\spellsr{Yes (Fortitude)}
\spellspecial If no creature or objects lie in the area, the lightning strikes elsewhere instead. It strikes the  occupied square within the spell's range that lies closest to its original destination. If multiple occupied squares are equally close, it strikes the largest target.
\begin{spelltargets}{Everything in the area}[Magic vs. Reflex]
    \spellsuccess 12d6 electricity damage \add d6 per two caster levels above 12th.
    \spellfailure As above, but half damage.
\end{spelltargets}
\spellnotes The lightning can unerringly identify invisible and concealed creatures, but it does not differentiate between friend, foe, and inanimate object.

\spellinfo{Conj (Creation) [Fog]}{Arcane, Nature, Water}
\spelltwocol{\spellzone{\areamed radius cylinder}}{\spellrng{\rngmed}}
\spelldur{\durshort}
\spellline
\spelleffect Fog blocks sight in the area, as \spell{fog cloud}. In addition to obscuring sight, the fog is so thick that any creature attempting to move through it progresses at a speed of 5 feet, regardless of its normal speed, and it takes a \minus2 penalty on all melee attack and melee damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into solid fog is slowed, so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces falling damage by 1d6.
\par A creature in the fog can take a full-round action to make a Strength check, moving 5 feet for every 5 by which the result exceeds DC 0. This movement is affected by any other effects which impede movement, as normal.
\spellnotes \fogspellnotes A severe wind disperses the fog within 1 minute, a windstorm disperses it within 5 rounds, and a hurricane disperses it within a round.

This spell can be made permanent with a \spell{permanency} ritual. A permanent solid fog dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.

\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes A creature with spell resistance may always make a saving throw when a spell is cast on it. If the creature succeeds, the spell has no effect on it. The type of saving throw made is indicated by the spell. If the spell also allows a saving throw of the same type, only one roll is made.

\spellsection{Spelltheft}{5}
\spellinfo{Abjur (Negation) [Magic]}{Abjur, Magic}
\spellspecial This spell functions like \spell{dispel magic}, except that you can choose to gain the effects of any spells you dispel as if they had been originally cast on you.

\spelldur{\durshort \dismissable}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\spellline
\spelleffect This spell creates a floating weapon made of magical force. Each round, as a swift action, you can direct the weapon to attack a target. If you do not direct the weapon, it remains motionless.

The weapon is sized for you, and can be any type of weapon you are proficient with, though the weapon's shape does not alter this spell's effects. It has 3 hit points per caster level, an Armor defense of 10 \add half your caster level, and a Maneuver defense of 10 \add your caster level \add your casting attribute. Most effects that don't affect objects do not affect the weapon.

\begin{spelltarget}*{One creature or object}l[Caster level \add casting attribute vs. Armor defense]
    \spellsuccess d8 force damage \add half your casting attribute.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes The weapon attacks during the action phase, regardless of when you direct it to attack a target.

The weapon can move up to 60 feet per round. It never provokes attacks of opportunity from opponents. Since the weapon is directed by you, its ability to interact with invisible or concealed creatures is no better than yours. Its special defenses are the same as your special defenses. If the weapon goes out of range of you, it winks out.

At the end of every round, the storm has an additional effect, as shown on \tref{Storm of Vengeance Effects}. Damaging effects deal 9d6 damage \add d6 per four caster levels above 18th.

The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do some obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell. Additionally, any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the fascinated creature, grants the creature a new saving throw with a \plus5 bonus.
    \par The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell duration expires, the activity is not performed.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes A very reasonable suggestion can grant a \plus2 or greater bonus on the magic attack.

    \spelleffect You gain telepathy out to a range of 100 feet. This allows you to send mental messages to any creature within range that has a language. Non-telepathic creatures can reply mentally to your messages, but they cannot initiative a telepathic conversation with you.

    You can address multiple creatures at once with telepathy, but maintaining separate mental conversations is just as difficult as simultaneously speaking and listening to multiple creatures at the same time.

    \spellsuccess The target is \slowed for a \durlong duration.

    If the target is \bloodied, it is instead permanently placed into a state of suspended animation. For the target, time ceases to flow and its condition becomes fixed. It does not grow older. Its body functions virtually cease, and no force or effect can move or harm it.
\end{spelltarget}

\spellsection{Time Stop}{9}
\spellinfo{Trans (Temporal)}{Arcane}
\spelldur{1d3\plus1 rounds (apparent time); see text}
\spellline
\spelleffect This spell seems to make time cease to flow for everyone but you. In fact, you step into an alternate timestream, causing you to speed up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen, though they are actually still moving at their normal speeds. You are free to act for 1d3\plus1 rounds of apparent time. You are still \vulnerable to danger, such as from heat or dangerous gases, but your actions have no effect on anything in the world other than yourself. Objects and creatures appear frozen in place. You cannot cast spells that affect any targets except yourself; the temporal magic is too strong to permit interference from lesser magic, and attempts to cast magic beyond the accelerated time surrounding you simply fail. The only exception is for temporal spells, which can be cast normally inside a \spell{time stop}. The subjects are not affected and do not attempt to resist the effects until the end of the \spell{time stop}, so you do not know whether they are affected by any spells you cast until the effect has expired.
\spellnotes Most spellcasters use the additional time to improve their defenses or flee from combat. You are undetectable while \spell{time stop} lasts. You cannot enter an area protected by an \spell{antimagic field} while under the effect of \spell{time stop}.

\begin{spelltarget}{One creature (Huge or smaller)}[Magic vs. Fortitude]
    \spellspecial If the target is not made of flesh (such as a golem), it is unaffected.
    \spellsuccess 6d6 physical damage immediately, and 3d6 physical damage at the end of each round after the first.

    If the target loses all its hit points, it becomes a mindless, inert statue, along with all its equipment. If the statue resulting from this effect is broken or damaged, the subject (if ever returned to its original state) has similar damage or deformities. The target is neither alive nor dead in this state.
    \spellfailure As above, but half damage.

The closest inspection cannot reveal that the tree in question is actually a magically concealed creature. To all normal tests you are, in fact, a tree or shrub, although a Spellcraft check can reveal the magical aura on the tree. While in tree form, you can observe all that transpires around you just as if you were in your normal form. You gain a \plus10 enhancement bonus to your armor modifier, but you have an effective Dexterity score of \minus10 and cannot move. You are immune to critical hits while in tree form.

Further, the subject can see into the Ethereal Plane (but not into extradimensional spaces). The effect extends out to \rngmed range.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes This effect does not allow the target to see into or through solid objects. It does not negate concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. True seeing does not help the viewer see through mundane disguises, spot creatures who are simply hiding, or notice secret doors hidden by mundane means. In addition, the spell effects cannot be further enhanced with known magic, so one cannot use \spell{true seeing} through a scrying effect.

\spelleffect This spell is the mightiest spell a wizard or sorcerer can cast. By simply speaking your desires aloud, you can alter reality to better suit you.
\par Even wish, however, has its limits.
\par A wish can produce any one of the following effects.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Duplicate any general wizard or sorcerer spell of 8th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.
    \item Duplicate any general wizard or sorcerer spell of 7th level or lower even if it's of a prohibited school.
    \item Duplicate any other spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.
    \item Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower even if it's of a prohibited school. 
    \item Undo the harmful effects of many other spells, such as geas/quest or insanity.
    \item Create a nonmagical item of up to 10,000 gp in value.
    \item Create a magic item, or add to the powers of an existing magic item.
    \item Remove injuries and afflictions. A single wish can aid one creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction. For example, you could heal all the damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same wish. A wish can never restore the experience point loss from casting a spell or the level or Constitution loss from being raised from the dead.
    \item Revive the dead. A wish can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a resurrection spell. A wish can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two wishes, one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again.
    \item Transport travelers. A wish can lift one creature per caster level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. You must make a Will attack to affect unwilling targets.
    \item Undo misfortune. A wish can undo a single recent event. The wish forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish could undo a foe's successful critical hit (either the attack roll or the critical roll), a friend's failed attack, and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. You must make a Will attack to affect an unwilling target.
\end{itemize}
\par When casting a wish, you do not specify the exact spell or effect you wish to duplicate. Instead, you make a wish, describing what you want to have happen, and make a DC 20 Wisdom check. If the check fails, your intent is redirected or perverted in some way. For example, a wish to turn a foe to stone would normally mimic the flesh to stone effect of the transmute flesh and stone spell. However, if the Wisdom check failed, your foe might gain the benefit of a \spell{stoneskin} spell instead.
\par You may try to use a wish to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. The DC of the Wisdom check increases to 25, and the negative consequences for failing the check increase in proportion to the potency of the effect you try to create.
\spellmat{10,000gp of diamonds. In addition, when a \spell{wish} duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 10,000 gp, you must provide that component.}

    \spelleffect This spell teleports you instantly back to your sanctuary. You must designate the sanctuary when you ready the spell for the day, and it must be a very familiar place. The actual point of arrival is a designated area no larger than 10 feet by 10 feet. You can be transported any distance within a plane but cannot travel between planes. You can transport, in addition to yourself, any objects you carry, as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. Exceeding this limit causes the spell to fail.
