\spelldur{\durshort}
\spelleffect Each animated object immediately attacks whomever or whatever you initially designate. Your control of the objects is limited to simple commands (``Attack,'' ``Defend,'' ``Stop,'' and so forth).
\par An animated object can be of any nonmagical material. You may animate one Small or smaller object or an equivalent number of larger objects per caster level. A Medium object counts as two Small or smaller objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as sixteen, and a Colossal object as thirty-two.

\spellsr{No}
\spellline
\spelleffect All spells, spell-like abilities, and magic items fail to function in the area. They cannot be activated from within the field, and any existing effects brought into or cast into the area are suppressed. Time spent within an \spell{antimagic field} counts against a suppressed spell's duration.
\par Summoned creatures of any type disappear if they enter an \spell{antimagic field}. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. 
\par Creatures within an \spell{antimagic field} cannot dismiss spells. However, you can dismiss your own antimagic field.
\spellnotes This spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures).

The effects of instantaneous conjurations, such as \spell{create water}, are not affected by this spell because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result.

\par \spell{Dispel magic} does not remove the field. Two or more \spell{antimagic fields} sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other.
\par Any part of a creature that lies outside the field is unaffected by the field.

\spelldur{Instantaneous and one hour; see text}
\begin{spelltarget}{One living creature}[Magic vs. Fortitude]
    \spellsuccess 9d10 life damage \add d10 per four caster levels above 18th. 
    \spellfailure As above, but half damage.
    \spelleffect If the target has no hit points remaining after taking damage from this spell, it is entirely assimilated into your form, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. An assimilated creature's equipment is unaffected.
    \par If the creature has at least 1 hit point following your use of this power, you gain temporary hit points equal to half the damage you dealt for 1 hour.
    \par If the creature is completely assimilated, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the damage you dealt and a \plus4 enhancement bonus to each of your attributes for 1 hour. In addition, you gain the appearance of the creature for 1 hour, granting you a \plus10 enhancement bonus on Disguise checks made to appear as that creature during that time.

    \spellsuccess The target feels an aversion to a particular person or object. If the object of the implanted aversion is an individual or a physical object, she will prefer not to approach within 30 feet of it. If it is a word, she will try not to utter it; if it is an action, she will not willingly attempt to perform it; and if it is an event, she will not willingly attend it. The target will take reasonable steps to avoid the object of its aversion, but will not put herself in jeopardy by doing so.
    \par If the target is unable to avoid the object of her aversion, she takes a \minus4 penalty to attacks, defenses, and checks for 1 round.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item All attacks made against you and spells targeted on you have a 50\% chance to fail. This failure chance is reduced to 20\% if the attack can strike ethereal targets or if the attacker can see ethereal targets. If both are true, the attack suffers no chance of failure. Force effects can strike ethereal targets.
        \item You take half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane).
        \item You take half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.
        \item All of your attacks and spells have a 20\% chance to happen while you are in the Ethereal Plane, which usually means they have no effect.

        \item You can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50\% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 damage per 5 feet so traveled.

    \spelleffect Other creatures take a \minus2 penalty on sight-based checks and physical attacks against the target, such as on Perception and Sense Motive checks.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes A \spell{see invisibility} spell does not counteract the blurring effect, but a \spell{true seeing} spell does.

\spellinfo{Evoc (Energy) [Fire]}{Arcane, Destruction, Nature, Fire}

    \spellfailure As above, but half damage.

\spellline
\spelleffect Your staff turns into a creature that looks and fights just like a treant. The staff-treant defends you and obeys any spoken commands. However, it is by no means a true treant; it cannot converse with actual treants or control trees.

If the staff-treant is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it crumbles to powder and the staff is destroyed. Otherwise, the staff returns to its normal form when the spell duration expires (or when the spell is dismissed), and it can be used as the material component for another casting of the spell. The staff-treant is always at full strength when created, despite any wounds it may have incurred the last time it appeared.
\spellline
\spellmat{The quarterstaff, which must be specially prepared. The staff must be a sound limb cut from an ash, oak, or yew, then cured, shaped, carved, and polished (a process requiring twenty-eight days).

\spelleffect Depending on the version you choose, this spell raises or lowers water.
\par \subspell{Lower Water} This causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by as much as 2 feet per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch). The water is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides are up to caster level \mtimes 10 feet long. In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell.
\par \subspell{Raise Water} This causes water or similar liquid to rise in height, just as the lower water version causes it to lower. Boats raised in this way slide down the sides of the hump that the spell creates. If the area affected by the spell includes riverbanks, a beach, or other land nearby, the water can spill over onto dry land.

Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The noise can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit, including speech. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from sixteen humans, while a roaring dire tiger is equal to the noise from twenty humans.

\spelleffect You can delay this spell's attack until up to 5 rounds after the spell is cast. You select the amount of delay upon completing the spell, and that time cannot change once it has been set unless someone touches the bead (see below). For every round that this spell is delayed, your caster level with it increases by 2.

If you choose a delay, a glowing bead sits at the point of origin until it detonates. A creature can pick up and hurl the bead as a thrown weapon (range increment 10 feet). If a creature handles and moves the bead within 1 round of its detonation, there is a 25\% chance that the bead detonates while being handled.

\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes The remains of a creature killed by this spell are consumed utterly (but not its equipment or possessions). The only way to restore life such a creature is to use \spell{true resurrection}, a carefully worded \spell{wish} spell followed by \spell{resurrection}, or \spell{miracle}.

\spelleffect As you cast this spell, you choose an alignment: good, evil, lawful, or chaotic. Anything within the spell's area that has the chosen alignment has a faint aura, visible only to you.

By concentrating on an aura (a standard action), you can determine the strength of the aura. Most aligned creatures and magic items have a faint aura. Creatures that embody the alignment (such as undead and outsiders with an aligned creature subtype) have a moderate aura. Creatures that act directly on behalf of the alignment (such as paladins and some clerics), and exceptionally potent aligned magic items (primarily artifacts) have a strong aura.
\spellnotes Each round, you can turn to detect objects in a new area. A detection spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

    \spelleffect You instantly recognize all of the target's vulnerabilities. This grants you a \plus2 bonus to attacks and weapon damage against that creature. In addition, you learn any significant weaknesses the creature has. This includes, but is not limited to, the following information:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Which of the target's defenses is lowest
        \item If the target has any vulnerabilities to specific damage types
        \item How to overcome the target's damage reduction, regeneration, or other similar abilities
    \end{itemize}

    \spelleffect Any creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. Its equipment is unaffected.
    \par When used against an object, the ray simply disintegrates as much as one 10-foot cube of nonliving matter. Thus, the spell disintegrates only part of any very large object or structure targeted.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes This spell affects even objects constructed entirely of force, such as \spell{wall of force}, but not magical effects such as an \spell{antimagic field}.

\spellspecial This spell has two versions: a targeted dispel, and an area dispel. Its effects depend on which version is chosen.
\begin{spelltarget}{One creature or object}[Caster level vs. Special]
    \spelleffect For every spell affecting the target, if the attack result beats a DC equal to 10 \add the caster level of the spell, it is dispelled.

    If the target is an object, and the attack result beats a DC equal to 10 \add the caster level of the object, the object is suppressed for 5 rounds. A suppressed object loses all its magical abilities, though it is still treated as being a magical object for the purpose of spells and effects.

    If the target is an effect of an ongoing spell (such as a summoned creature), and the attack result beats a DC equal to 10 \add the caster level of the spell, the target is treated as if the spell that created it was dispelled. This usually causes the target to disappear.
\end{spelltarget}

\spellline
\spellburst{\areamed radius}
\begin{spelltargets}*{All creatures and unattended objects in the area}l[Caster level vs. Special]
    \spelleffect If the attack result beats a DC equal to 10 \add the caster level of the highest level spell on the target, that effect is dispelled. If there are multiple spells of the same level, choose one randomly.
\end{spelltargets}

\spellnotes A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. If a spell affects multiple targets, it must be dispelled individually on each target. Dispelling the effect on one target does not affect the other targets of the spell.

Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be dispelled by this spell. A spell without a duration cannot be dispelled, even if it has a lasting effect.

You may choose to automatically succeed or fail on your attack against any spell that you cast yourself.

Spell-like abilities are treated like spells, and this spell affects them in the same way it affects spells.

Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.

\spellinfo{Ench (Compulsion) [Domination, Mind-Affecting]}{Ench}
\spellrng{\rngmed}
\spelldur{One day}
\begin{spelltarget}{One humanoid creature}[Magic vs. Will]
    \spellsuccess You can control the actions of the target through a telepathic link that you establish with the target's mind.
    \par If you and the target have a common language, you can generally force the target to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as ``Come here," ``Go there," ``Fight," and ``Stand still." If you concentrate on the spell, you know what the target is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically.
    \par Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth). Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the target's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill description).
    It takes time for the link to be established. For the first hour after the spell is cast, you must concentrate on the spell (a standard action) to control the target's actions. While you are not concentrating on the spell, the creature acts as if confused, as the \spell{confusion} spell, except that it never attacks you. If the target would randomly attack you, it instead is forced to follow your commands. At the end of the hour, you must make a second Will attack. If you concentrate on the spell during this time, you gain a \plus4 bonus to the attack. If your attack succeeds, you dominate the creature fully for the remainder of the spell duration. Otherwise, the creature is freed.
    \par After the first hour, changing your instructions or giving a dominated creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.
    \par By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the target, though it still can't communicate with you. You can't actually see through the target's eyes, so it's not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on.
    \par The target resists this control, and you must make a new attack to force it to take an action against its nature. Failure means it breaks free. This does not apply when a target is merely ordered to perform an action it disagrees with -- the action must be directly opposed to the target's beliefs. Ordering a paladin to murder an innocent would require a new attack, but ordering him to build a bridge that would allow an evil army to cross a river would not. If your command would obviously lead to the creature's death, your attack takes a \minus10 penalty. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the target are on the same plane. You need not see the target to control it.
    \par If you recast this spell on a target you have dominated before it escapes your control, you can extend the duration of the spell indefinitely. You do not need to make a new attack when you renew your control in this fashion.

The temporary hit points disappear after 1 hour. If you take life damage, you lose all temporary hit points provided by this spell before applying the damage.

    As long as you have temporary hit points from this spell, you are treated as being undead for the purpose of spells or abilities which affect undead. This can cause some unintelligent undead, such as skeletons and zombies, to avoid attacking you.

All creatures initially appear wherever you desire within the spell's area. Once these creatures appear, they serve you for the duration of the spell.
\par The elementals obey you explicitly and never attack you, even if someone else manages to gain control over them. You do not need to concentrate to maintain control over the elementals. You can dismiss them singly or in groups at any time.

\begin{spelltarget}{One humanoid creature (Huge or smaller)}l[Magic vs. Fortitude]
    \spelleffect The target instantly grows, doubling its height and multiplying its weight by 8. This increase changes the creature's size category to the next larger one. This has several effects.
    \begin{itemize} 
        \item \plus10 ft. bonus to movement speed.
        \item \plus4 bonus to maneuver attack and defense.

        \item \plus2 enhancement bonus to Strength.
        \item \minus4 penalty to Stealth checks.
    \end{itemize}
    \par A typical humanoid creature whose size increases to Large has a space of 10 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet.
    \par If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it -- the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size.
    \par All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly enlarged by the spell. Melee and projectile weapons affected by this spell deal more damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any enlarged item that leaves an enlarged creature's possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage, and projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them. Magical properties of enlarged items are not increased by this spell.

    \spelleffect You become ethereal, along with your equipment. For the duration of the spell, you are in a place called the Ethereal Plane, which overlaps the normal, physical, Material Plane. When the spell expires, you return to material existence.
    \par An ethereal creature is invisible, insubstantial, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down, albeit at half normal speed. As an insubstantial creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear on the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and ephemeral. Sight and hearing onto the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.
    \par Force effects and abjurations affect an ethereal creature normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane (such as a basilisk's gaze attack). Treat other ethereal creatures and ethereal objects as if they were material. 
    \par If you end the spell and become material while inside a material object (such as a solid wall), you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 damage per 5 feet that you so travel.

\begin{spelltarget}{One willing corporeal creature}
    \spelleffect The target and all its equipment becomes insubstantial, misty, and translucent. Its armor defense modifier becomes 0, though other defense modifiers continue to apply normally. It gains physical damage reduction, reducing the physical damage it takes each round by 12 \add 1 per caster level above 6th. If it takes damage from a spell or magic weapon, it cannot use its damage reduction for 1 round. It becomes immune to critical hits.

    The target can't attack or cast spells with verbal, somatic, or material components while in gaseous form. If it has a touch spell ready to use, that spell is discharged harmlessly when the gaseous form spell takes effect.
    \par A gaseous creature can fly at a speed of 10 feet (special maneuverability). It can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with all it was wearing or holding in its hands, as long as the spell persists. The creature is subject to the effects of wind, and it can't enter water or other liquid. It also can't manipulate objects or activate items, even those carried along with its gaseous form.

\begin{spelltarget}{Up to three vermin in the area}
    \spelleffect You turn three normal-sized centipedes, two normal-sized spiders, or a single normal-sized scorpion into Large-sized forms. Only one type of vermin can be transmuted (so a single casting cannot affect both a centipede and a spider), and all must be grown to the same size.
    \par Any giant vermin created by this spell do not attempt to harm you, but your control of such creatures is limited to simple commands (``Attack," ``Defend," ``Stop," and so forth). Orders to attack a certain creature when it appears or guard against a particular occurrence are too complex for the vermin to understand.

\spelleffect Any creature moving through the area must make an Acrobatics check to balance. The DC is equal to half your caster level \add your casting attribute. Success means it moves normally (though usually at half speed, because it is balancing). Failure means the creature's movement is wasted. Failure by 10 or more means it also falls prone.

\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes In addition to the effect noted, a \spell{gust of wind} can do anything that a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do. It can extinguish open flames, create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings or hangings, heel over a small boat, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of its range.

\spelleffect This spell creates a floating, disembodied hand made of magical force. Each round, as a swift action, you can direct the hand to protect you from a target. If you do not direct the hand, it remains motionless.

The hand is 10 feet long and about that wide with its fingers outstretched. It has 3 hit points per caster level, an Armor defense of 10 \add half your caster level, and a Maneuver defense of 10 \add your caster level \add your casting attribute. Most effects that don't affect objects do not affect the hand.

\begin{spelltarget}*{One creature}
    \spelleffect The hand provides you with active cover from the target. Each physical attack the target makes against you has a 20\% chance to strike the hand instead. In addition, if the target is Large size or smaller, it moves at half speed while moving towards you.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes The hand can move up to 60 feet per round. It never provokes attacks of opportunity from opponents. Since the hand is directed by you, its ability to interact with invisible or concealed creatures is no better than yours. Its special defenses are the same as your special defenses.

    \par You are immune to blindness, critical hits, attribute damage, deafness, disease, drowning, electricity, poison, stunning, and all spells or attacks that affect your physiology or respiration, because you have no physiology or respiration while this spell is in effect. You take only half damage from acid and fire of all kinds.
    \par You gain a \plus5 enhancement bonus to your Strength score, but you take a \minus5 penalty to Dexterity as well, and your speed is reduced to half normal. You have a \minus8 armor check penalty. You cannot drink (and thus can't use potions) or play wind instruments.
    \par Your unarmed attacks deal damage equal to a warhammer sized for you (1d6 for Small characters or 1d8 for Medium characters), and you are considered armed when making unarmed attacks.

If the target object is stuck or held, you can immediately make an Strength check to break it open, using your caster level instead of your Strength. Others can aid you on this check as normal. In addition, if the target object is locked, you can immediately make a Disable Device check to open the lock as if you had rolled a 20 on the check. You get an enhancement bonus on the Disable Device check equal to half your caster level.

As a swift action, you can mentally direct the target to move up or down as much as 20 feet each round. You cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face of a cliff, for example, or push against a ceiling to move laterally (generally at half its land speed).

\spellcmp{Verbal, Somatic, and Material}
\spelltwocol{\spelltgteffarea{See text}}{\spellrng{See text}}

\spelleffect A limited wish lets you create nearly any type of effect. For example, a limited wish can do any of the following things.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Duplicate any general sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.
    \item Duplicate any general sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th level or lower, even if it's of a prohibited school.
    \item Duplicate any other spell of 4th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.
    \item Duplicate any other spell of 3rd level or lower, even if it's of a prohibited school.
    \item Undo the harmful effects of many spells, such as geas/quest or insanity.
    \item Produce any other effect whose power level is in line with the above effects, such as a single creature automatically hitting on its next attack or taking a \minus5 penalty to its defenses for 5 rounds.
\end{itemize}
\par When casting a limited wish, you do not specify the exact spell or effect you wish to duplicate. Instead, you make a wish, describing what you want to have happen, and make a DC 15 Wisdom check. If the check fails, your intent is redirected or perverted in some way. For example, a \spell{limited wish} to turn a foe to stone would normally mimic the \spell{flesh to stone} effect of the \spell{transmute flesh and stone} spell. However, if the Wisdom check failed, your foe might gain the benefit of a \spell{stoneskin} spell instead.
\par When a limited wish spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 1,000 gp, you must provide that component (in addition to the 1,000 gp cost for this spell).

You can search for general creatures based on visual characteristics (such as ``pointy ears'' or ``looking human''), in which case you locate the nearest one of its kind if more than one is within the range. Attempting to find a certain creature requires a specific and accurate mental image of a distinguishing visual characteristic, such as its clothes or face; if the image is not close enough to the actual creature, the spell fails.

\begin{spelltarget}{One creature}
    \spelleffect As you cast this spell, you choose whether to create body armor or a shield. If you choose body armor, the target gains a \plus2 armor modifier. If you choose a shield, the target gains a \plus2 shield modifier. The bonus granted increases to \plus3 at 8th caster level, to \plus4 at 14th caster level, and finally to \plus5 at 20th caster level. 
    \par Unlike mundane armor, \spell{mage armor} entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction.
    \par If you are the target, this spell lasts for \durlong duration. On any other creature, it lasts for \durshort duration.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes If you cast this spell on the same creature twice, you can grant the creature both body armor and a shield. The armor created by this spell is treated as a separate piece or armor from any other armor the creature is wearing, so it does not stack with any existing bonuses. Since \spell{mage armor} is made of force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor.

    If the item is an artifact, there is only a 1\% chance per caster level that the spell works. If you destroy an artifact in this way, you permanently lose the ability to cast \spell{mage's disjunction}.
    \spellsuccess The target item is permanently rendered nonmagical.
    \spellfailure The target item is suppressed for 5 rounds. A suppressed object loses all its magical abilities, though it is still treated as being a magical object for the purpose of spells and effects.

\spellnotes You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike (instead, see \spell{magic fang}). A monk's unarmed strike is considered a weapon, and thus it can be enhanced by this spell.
\par If you use this spell to enhance projectiles, the projectiles must be of the same kind, and they have to be together (in the same quiver or other container). Projectiles, but not thrown weapons, lose their transmutation when used. (Treat darts and shuriken as projectiles, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell.)

    \spellsuccess The target is teleported into an extradimensional labyrinth of force planes. Each round, as a full-round action, it may attempt a DC 20 Intelligence check to escape the labyrinth. If the target doesn't escape, the maze disappears after 5 minutes, forcing the target back to the location where it was originally banished.
    \spellfailure As above, but the DC of the Intelligence check to escape is 10.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as \spell{teleport} and \spell{dimension door}, do not help a creature escape a \spell{maze} spell, although a \spell{plane shift} spell allows it to exit to whatever plane is designated in that spell. Minotaurs can escape the spell automatically.

When leaving the maze, the target reappears where it had been when the maze spell was cast. If this location is filled with a solid object, the target appears in the nearest open space.

\begin{spelltarget}{You}
    \spelleffect You can meld your body and possessions into a single block of stone. The stone must be large enough to accommodate your body in all three dimensions. When the casting is complete, you and not more than 100 pounds of nonliving gear merge with the stone. If either condition is violated, the spell fails and is wasted.
    \par While in the stone, you remain in contact, however tenuous, with the face of the stone through which you melded. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while hiding in the stone. Nothing that goes on outside the stone can be seen, but you can still hear what happens around you. Minor physical damage to the stone does not harm you, but its partial destruction (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. If the stone is completely destroyed, you are expelled, and you die unless your Fortitude defense is at least 20.
    \par At any time before the duration expires, you can step out of the stone through the surface that you entered. If the spell's duration expires or the effect is dispelled before you voluntarily exit the stone, you are violently expelled and take 5d6 points of damage.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes The following spells harm you if cast upon the stone that you are occupying: \spell{transmute flesh and stone} expels you and deals 6d6 points of damage. \spellindirect{shape stone}{Shape stone} deals 3d6 points of damage but does not expel you. \spell{Passwall} expels you without damage.

\spelleffect You don't so much cast a miracle as request one. You state what you would like to have happen and request that your deity (or the power you pray to for spells) intercede.
\par A miracle can do any of the following things.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Duplicate any cleric spell of 8th level or lower (including spells to which you have access because of your domains). 
    \item Duplicate any other spell of 7th level or lower.
    \item Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as feeblemind or insanity.
    \item Have any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.
\end{itemize}
\par Alternatively, a cleric can make a very powerful request. Examples of especially powerful miracles of this sort could include the following.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Swiinging the tide of a battle in your favor by raising fallen allies to continue fighting.
    \item Moving you and your allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to another through planar barriers to a specific locale with no chance of error.
    \item Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster.
\end{itemize}
\par In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity's (or alignment's) nature is refused.
\spellnotes If you request a miracle, your deity (or the power you pray to) will expect something of you in return. You must cast \spell{commune}commune to learn what this is within 24 hours, or you will lose the ability to cast any cleric spells other than \spell{commune}. For more moderate miracles, you may be required to offer 25,000gp worth of incense and gems. For especially powerful miracles, or multiple moderate miracles, you may geased with a task to complete.
\par When a miracle spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 5,000 gp, you must provide that component.

Typically, this means the target moves in a random direction each round to escape the maze.

\spelleffect You tap energy from the Plane of Shadow to create a quasi-real version of yourself. The projected image looks, sounds, and smells like you, but is intangible. Normally, it mimics your actions perfectly, including speech.
\par As a swift action, you can attune to the projected image. This has several effects.
\begin{itemize}
    \item You see and hear from the image's location, rather from where your body is.
    \item Any spells you cast originate from the image instead of from you. This causes you to measure range, line of effect, and so on from the image's location, rather than from your location.
    \item You can control the image's actions independently from your own actions. Each round, it can move up to 100 feet in any direction, including vertically.
\end{itemize}

As a free action, you can stop attuning to the projected image.

\spellnotes You must maintain line of effect to the projected image at all times. If your line of effect is obstructed, the spell ends. If you teleport or use a similar effect that breaks your line of effect, even momentarily, the spell ends.

Since the image is not a creature, it is difficult to disrupt, and many spells have no effect on it.

\begin{spelltarget}{One creature}
    \spelleffect All attacks that would affect the creature, including magical and supernatural attacks, have a 50\% chance to be absorbed by the umbra. Attacks absorbed by the umbra have no effect on the target. The umbra is selective, and does not inhibit beneficial effects.

    Whenever the umbra absorbs an attack, it alters the creature's appearance (including smell, sound, and other senses, as appropriate) with a glamer. This causes the creature to seem as if were affected by the attack. Outside observers have no way of knowing which attacks were absorbed by the umbra unless they can recognize the illusion. The spell does not attempt to mimic the effects of extraordinary attacks which cannot be disguised, such as attacks which would destroy the creature's body.

\spellspecial As you cast this spell, choose a command word.
\begin{spelltarget}{One nonmagical object (Medium or smaller; see text)}l[Magic vs. Will]
    \spellsuccess The target shrinks to 1/16 of its normal size in each dimension (to about 1/4,000 the original volume and mass). This change effectively reduces its size by four size categories. If the target is physically unable to shrink, such as a ring on a finger, it shrinks as much as it can without causing harm to itself or the physical impediment.

    As a standard action, any creature can speak the command word to return the target to its original size. It must be resting on a stable surface. If the command word is spoken while the target is not stable, such as while it is in the air, it returns to its original size as soon as it finds a resting point. Restoring the target to its normal size ends the spell.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes This spell can normally target an object of up to Medium size. You can shrink a Large object at 10th caster level, a Huge object at 16th caster level, or a Gargantuan object at 24th caster level.
\par This spell can be made permanent with a \spell{permanency} ritual, in which case the affected object can be shrunk and expanded an indefinite number of times, but only by the original caster. If you recast the spell each day on an object, you can keep it at its small size indefinitely.

\begin{spelltarget}{One creature or object}[Magic vs. Will]
    \spelleffect The target becomes unable to make noise. Any noises it makes are inaudible to other creatures. When you cast the spell, you may choose whether the target can still hear itself normally, potentially causing it to be unaware of the effect of the spell.

    Extraordinarily loud noises, such as the yell of a giant, are merely muffled by the spell rather than completely silenced. The DC to hear such sounds produced by the target is increased by 40. Sonic attacks function normally.
\end{spelltarget}

\spelleffect This spell creates the visual illusion of an object, creature, or force within the area, as determined by you. The illusion does not create sound, smell, texture, or temperature. As a standard action, you can concentrate to alter the image within the area.
\spellnotes Creatures can recognize the figment as unreal by interacting with it physically, or by making a Perception check against a DC equal to 10 \add half your caster level \add your casting attribute. A creature gets a \plus10 bonus on this Perception check when using senses which should be present in the figment, but which are missing.

A creature faced with definitive proof that the figment is unreal can disbelieve it, treating it as if it were not there.

\spelleffect Fog blocks sight in the area, as \spell{fog cloud}. In addition to obscuring sight, the fog is so thick that any creature attempting to move through it progresses at a speed of 5 feet, regardless of its normal speed, and it takes a \minus2 penalty on all melee attack and melee damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into solid fog is slowed, so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces falling damage by 1d6.
\par A creature in the fog can take a full-round action to make a Strength check, moving 5 feet for every 5 by which the result exceeds DC 0. This movement is affected by any other effects which impede movement, as normal.
\spellnotes \fogspellnotes A severe wind disperses the fog within 1 minute, a windstorm disperses it within 5 rounds, and a hurricane disperses it within a round.

\spelleffect This spell creates a floating weapon made of magical force. Each round, as a swift action, you can direct the weapon to attack a target. If you do not direct the weapon, it remains motionless.

The weapon is sized for you, and can be any type of weapon you are proficient with, though the weapon's shape does not alter this spell's effects. It has 3 hit points per caster level, an Armor defense of 10 \add half your caster level, and a Maneuver defense of 10 \add your caster level \add your casting attribute. Most effects that don't affect objects do not affect the weapon.

\begin{spelltarget}*{One creature or object}l[Caster level \add casting attribute vs. Armor defense]
    \spellsuccess d8 force damage \add half your casting attribute.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes The weapon attacks during the action phase, regardless of when you direct it to attack a target.

The weapon can move up to 60 feet per round. It never provokes attacks of opportunity from opponents. Since the weapon is directed by you, its ability to interact with invisible or concealed creatures is no better than yours. Its special defenses are the same as your special defenses. If the weapon goes out of range of you, it winks out.

The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do some obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell. Additionally, any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the fascinated creature, grants the creature a new saving throw with a \plus5 bonus.
    \par The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration.

\spelldur{1d3\plus1 rounds (apparent time); see text}
\spellline
\spelleffect This spell seems to make time cease to flow for everyone but you. In fact, you step into an alternate timestream, causing you to speed up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen, though they are actually still moving at their normal speeds. You are free to act for 1d3\plus1 rounds of apparent time. You are still \vulnerable to danger, such as from heat or dangerous gases, but your actions have no effect on anything in the world other than yourself. Objects and creatures appear frozen in place. You cannot cast spells that affect any targets except yourself; the temporal magic is too strong to permit interference from lesser magic, and attempts to cast magic beyond the accelerated time surrounding you simply fail. The only exception is for temporal spells, which can be cast normally inside a \spell{time stop}. The targets are not affected and do not attempt to resist the effects until the end of the \spell{time stop}, so you do not know whether they are affected by any spells you cast until the effect has expired.
\spellnotes Most spellcasters use the additional time to improve their defenses or flee from combat. You are undetectable while \spell{time stop} lasts. You cannot enter an area protected by an \spell{antimagic field} while under the effect of \spell{time stop}.

    \spellfailure[Will] As above, but the penalty is halved.

\spellspecial This spell can be used to duplicate the effects of \spell{fabricate}, \spell{passwall}, \spell{shape metal}, \spell{shape stone}, \spell{shape wood}, \spell{transmute flesh and stone}, or \spell{wall of stone}. The object or creature to be transformed must meet any requirements of the spell being duplicated, other than range.

\spellsection{Transmute Flesh and Stone}{6}
\spellinfo{Trans (Polymorph)}{Arcane, Earth}
\spellrng{\rngmed}
\spellspecial This spell has two versions: transmuting flesh into stone, and transmuting stone into flesh. Its effects depend on which version is chosen.
\begin{spelltarget}{One creature (Huge or smaller)}[Magic vs. Fortitude]
    \spellspecial If the target is not made of flesh (such as a golem), it is unaffected.
    \spellsuccess 6d6 physical damage immediately, and 3d6 physical damage at the end of each round after the first.

    If the target loses all its hit points, it becomes a mindless, inert statue, along with all its equipment. If the statue resulting from this effect is broken or damaged, the target (if ever returned to its original state) has similar damage or deformities. The target is neither alive nor dead in this state.
    \spellfailure As above, but half damage.
\end{spelltarget}

\begin{spelltarget}{One petrified creature (Huge or smaller)}
    \spellsuccess The target is restored to its normal state, including its equipment. Stone which was not originally a petrified creature is unaffected.

\begin{spelltarget}{You}
    \spelleffect You become able to assume the form of a Large living tree or shrub or a Large dead tree trunk with a small number of limbs. The closest inspection cannot reveal that the tree in question is actually a magically concealed creature. To all normal tests you are, in fact, a tree or shrub, although a Spellcraft check can reveal the magical aura on the tree. While in tree form, you can observe all that transpires around you just as if you were in your normal form. You gain a \plus10 enhancement bonus to your armor modifier, but you have an effective Dexterity score of \minus10 and cannot move. You are immune to critical hits while in tree form. All clothing and gear carried or worn changes with you.

\begin{spelltarget}{One creature}
    \spelleffect The target sees through normal and magical darkness, notices secret doors hidden by magic, sees the truth behind visual figments and glamers, and sees the true form of polymorphed, changed, or transmuted things. In addition, the target can see into the Ethereal Plane (but not into extradimensional spaces). The effect extends out to \rngmed range.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes This effect does not allow the target to see into or through solid objects. It does not negate concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. True seeing does not help the viewer see through mundane disguises, spot creatures who are simply hiding, or notice secret doors hidden by mundane means. In addition, the spell effects cannot be further enhanced with known magic, so one cannot use \spell{true seeing} through a scrying effect.
\spellmat{An ointment for the eyes that costs 100 gp and is made from mushroom powder, saffron, and fat.}

\spelleffect This spell creates a wall made of stone atop an existing rock surface. A 5-foot square of wall has 60 hit points, and hardness 8. The wall is four inches thick.
\par Unlike most walls, a \spell{wall of stone} need not be vertical. It need not rest entirely on solid ground, as long as it is solidly supported by existing stone.

\spelleffect This spell is the mightiest spell a wizard or sorcerer can cast. By simply speaking your desires aloud, you can alter reality to better suit you.
\par Even wish, however, has its limits.
\par A wish can produce any one of the following effects.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Duplicate any general wizard or sorcerer spell of 8th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.
    \item Duplicate any general wizard or sorcerer spell of 7th level or lower even if it's of a prohibited school.
    \item Duplicate any other spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.
    \item Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower even if it's of a prohibited school. 
    \item Undo the harmful effects of many other spells, such as geas/quest or insanity.
    \item Create a nonmagical item of up to 10,000 gp in value.
    \item Create a magic item, or add to the powers of an existing magic item.
    \item Remove injuries and afflictions. A single wish can aid one creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction. For example, you could heal all the damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same wish. A wish can never restore the experience point loss from casting a spell or the level or Constitution loss from being resurrected.
    \item Revive the dead. A wish can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a resurrection spell. A wish can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two wishes, one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again.
    \item Transport travelers. A wish can lift one creature per caster level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. You must make a Will attack to affect unwilling targets.
    \item Undo misfortune. A wish can undo a single recent event. The wish forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish could undo a foe's successful critical hit (either the attack roll or the critical roll), a friend's failed attack, and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. You must make a Will attack to affect an unwilling target.
\end{itemize}
\par When casting a wish, you do not specify the exact spell or effect you wish to duplicate. Instead, you make a wish, describing what you want to have happen, and make a DC 20 Wisdom check. If the check fails, your intent is redirected or perverted in some way. For example, a wish to turn a foe to stone would normally mimic the flesh to stone effect of the transmute flesh and stone spell. However, if the Wisdom check failed, your foe might gain the benefit of a \spell{stoneskin} spell instead.
\par You may try to use a wish to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. The DC of the Wisdom check increases to 25, and the negative consequences for failing the check increase in proportion to the potency of the effect you try to create.
\spellmat{10,000gp of diamonds. In addition, when a \spell{wish} duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 10,000 gp, you must provide that component.}
