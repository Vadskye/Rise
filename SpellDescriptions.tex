\spellsection{Ablate Impact}{2}
\spelldesc{You instantly reduce the force of an incoming blow.}
\spellinfo{Abjur (Shielding)}{Abjur}
\spelltime{Immediate action}
\spellcmp{Verbal only}
\spelltwocol{\spelltgt{You}}{\spellrng{Personal}}
\spelldur{1 round}
\begin{spelleffect}
    You gain physical damage reduction 10/force. This damage reduction increases by 1 per caster level above 4th.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    This spell's damage reduction allows the subject to ignore the first 10 physical damage it takes each round. If it is hit by a attack that deals force damage, such as \spell{magic missile}, it cannot use its damage reduction for 1 round.

    You can cast this spell instantaneously, quickly enough react to an opponent attacking you (but before the attack is rolled).
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Ablative Shield}{1}
\spelldesc{You instantly encase yourself a shimmering field of magical energy, protecting you from hostile magic.}
\spellinfo{Abjur (Negation) [Magic]}{Abjur, Magic}
\spelltime{Immediate action}
\spellcmp{Verbal only}
\spelltwocol{\spelltgt{You}}{\spellrng{\rngpers}}
\spelldur{1 round}
\begin{spelleffect}
    You gain spell damage reduction 5/force. This damage reduction increases by 1 per caster level above 2nd.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    This spell's damage reduction allows the subject to ignore the first 5 damage it takes each round from spells and spell-like abilities. If it is hit by a attack that deals force damage, such as \spell{magic missile}, it cannot use its damage reduction for 1 round.

    Spells that are not subject to spell resistance are not affected by \spell{ablative shield}. You can cast this spell instantly - quickly enough to gain its benefits in an emergency. Casting the spell is an immediate action, so you can use this spell even when it's not your turn.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Acid Arrow}{2}
\spelldesc{You fire a magical arrow of acid from your hand that speeds to its target.}
\spellinfo{Conj (Creation) [Acid]}{Arcane}

\spelldur{1 round per two caster levels}
\spellattack{Magic vs. Reflex and Fortitude}
\begin{spellsuccess}
    If you beat the target's Reflex defense, it takes 5d8 acid damage immediately, and 2d8 acid damage at the end of each round after the first. If you also beat the target's Fortitude defense, it is \vulnerable.
\end{spellsuccess}
\begin{spellnotes}
    If the target becomes submerged in liquid or takes at least twenty points of fire or cold damage, this spell's effect ends.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Acid Fog}{8}

\spellinfo{Conj (Creation) [Acid, Fog]}{Arcane, Destruction}
\spelltwocol{\spellzone{\areamed radius cylinder}}{\spellrng{\rngmed}}
\spelldur{\durshort}
\begin{spelleffect}
    This spell functions like \spell{solid fog}, except that the fog is highly acidic.
\end{spelleffect}
\spellattacktargets{Magic vs. Fortitude}{Everything in the area}
\spelltrigger{End of round}
\begin{spellsuccess}

\spelldur{\durshort}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}

    10 temporary hit points \add 1 per caster level above 4th, and a \plus2 enhancement bonus to Will defense. \spellbonusscalingdescription

\spellsection{Air Walk}{4}
\spelldesc{You imbue the subject with the ability to walk on nothing but air.}
\spellinfo{Trans (Imbuement) [Air]}{Air, Divine, Nature, Travel}
\spelltwocol{\spelltgt{One creature}}{\spellrng{\rngtouch}}
\spelldur{\durshort}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
    The subject can walk on air as if it were solid ground. The magic only affects the subject's legs, and does not grant the ability to climb vertically through the air. If the subject is Colossal size or larger, this spell has no effect.
    \par Should the spell end while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 damage per 10 feet of fall.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    \par You can cast \spell{air walk} on a specially trained mount so it can be ridden through the air. You can train a mount to move with the aid of \spell{air walk} (counts as a trick; see Handle Animal skill) with one week of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Align Weapon}{2}
\spelldesc{You enhance a weapon while bringing it closer to your ideals.}
\spellschool{Evoc/Trans (Augment, Channeling) [see text]}
\spelllists{Chaos, Evil, Good, Law}
\begin{spelleffect}
    This spell functions like \spell{magic weapon}, except that it can also give the weapon an alignment.
\end{spelleffect}
\spellattack{Magic vs. Will (object)}
\begin{spellsuccess}
    The item becomes good, evil, lawful, or chaotic, as you choose, allowing it to overcome damage reduction of the appropriate type. This overrides any existing alignments.
\end{spellsuccess}
\begin{spellnotes}
    When you make a weapon good, evil, lawful, or chaotic, \spell{align weapon} is a good, evil, lawful, or chaotic spell, respectively.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Alter Weapon}{1}
\spellinfo{Trans (Alteration)}{Arcane}
\spelltwocol{\spelltgt{One weapon}}{\spellrng{Touch}}
\spelldur{\durmed}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\spellattack{Magic vs. Will (object)}
\begin{spellsuccess}
    The weapon transforms into a different weapon from the same weapon group. In addition, you can decrease (but not increase) its size by one size category.
\end{spellsuccess}

\spellsectioncomma{Alter Weapon}{Greater}{4}
\spellinfo{Trans (Alteration)}{Arcane}
\begin{spelleffect}
    This spell functions like \spell{alter weapon}, except that you have more freedom over the weapon's shape. In addition, at any time during the duration of the spell, you can touch the weapon and concentrate (a standard action) to change the weapon's shape again.
\end{spelleffect}
\spellattack{Magic vs. Will (object)}
\begin{spellsuccess}
    The weapon transforms into any other manufactured weapon (but not an improvised weapon). In addition, you can increase or decrease its size by one size category.
\end{spellsuccess}

\spellsection{Animal Growth}{7}

\spelllists{Nature, Wild}
\spelltwocol{\spelllimit{\areamed radius}}{\spellrng{\rngmed}}
\spelltgts{Five animals in the area}
\begin{spelleffect}
    This spell functions like \spell{enlarge person}, except that it affects multiple animals.
\end{spelleffect}

\begin{comment}
\spellsection{Animate Objects}{5}
\spelldesc{You imbue inanimate objects with mobility and a semblance of life.}
\spellinfo{Trans (Animation)}{Chaos, Trans}
\spelltwocol{\spelllimit{\areamed radius}}{\spellrng{\rngmed}}
\spelltgts{One Small object/level in the area; see text}
\spelldur{\durshort}
\begin{spelleffect}
    Each animated object immediately attacks whomever or whatever you initially designate. Your control of the objects is limited to simple commands (``Attack,'' ``Defend,'' ``Stop,'' and so forth).
    \par An animated object can be of any nonmagical material. You may animate one Small or smaller object or an equivalent number of larger objects per caster level. A Medium object counts as two Small or smaller objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as sixteen, and a Colossal object as thirty-two. You can give the objects new commands as a move action, as normal for directing an active spell.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    This spell cannot animate objects carried or worn by a creature. This spell can be made permanent with a \spell{permanency} ritual.
\end{spellnotes}
\end{comment}

\spelldesc{You imbue inanimate plants with mobility and a semblance of life.}
\spellinfo{Trans (Animation)}{Nature, Plant}
\spelltgts{One Small plant/level in the area; see text}
\begin{spelleffect}
    This spell functions like \spell{animate objects}, except that you animate plants instead of inanimate objects.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    \spell{Animate plants} cannot affect plant creatures, nor does it affect nonliving vegetable material.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Antilife Shell}{7}
\spelldesc{You create an immobile, spherical energy field that hedges out living creatures.}
\spellinfo{Abjur (Interdiction) [Barrier]}{Divine, Nature, Wild}
\spellzone{\areasmall radius from you} 
\spelldur{\durlong \dismissable}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
    Living creatures cannot enter the spell's area. Nonliving creatures, such as constructs and undead, suffer no ill effect.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    Barrier spells may be used only defensively, not aggressively. Creatures in the area at the time that the spell is cast are unaffected by the spell.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Antimagic Field}{7}
\spelldesc{You create a mobile, spherical energy field that suppresses magic.}
\spellinfo{Abjur (Negation) [Magic]}{Abjur, Divine, Magic}
\spellemanation{\areasmall radius centered on you}
\spelldur{\durlong \dismissable}
\begin{spelleffect}
    All spells, spell-like abilities, supernatural abilities, and magic items fail to function in the area of this spell. They cannot be activated from within the field, and any existing effects brought into or cast into the area are suppressed. Time spent within an \spell{antimagic field} counts against a suppressed spell's duration.
    \par Summoned creatures of any type and incorporeal undead disappear if they enter an \spell{antimagic field}. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations, such as \spell{create water}, are not affected by an \spell{antimagic field} because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result.)
    \par Creatures within an \spell{antimagic field} cannot dismiss spells. However, you can dismiss your own antimagic field.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    A normal creature can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically in the area, it is still a sword. The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned.
    \par \spell{Dispel magic} does not remove the field. Two or more \spell{antimagic fields} sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as \spell{wall of force}, \spell{prismatic sphere}, and \spell{prismatic wall}, remain unaffected by \spell{antimagic field} (see the individual spell descriptions).
    \par Any part of a creature that lies outside the field is unaffected by the field.
    \par Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. 
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Aqueous Blade}{2}
\spelldesc{You transform the active part of your ally's weapon into water, weakening its blows but allowing it penetrate your foe's defenses more easily.}
\spellinfo{Trans (Alteration) [Water]}{Nature, Water}
\spelltwocol{\spelltgt{One weapon}}{\spellrng{\rngclose}}
\spelldur{\durshort \dismissable}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\spellattack{Magic vs. Will}
\begin{spellsuccess}
    Attacks with the affected weapon are made against Reflex defense instead of Armor defense. However, damage with the weapon is halved, including any bonuses to damage.
\end{spellsuccess}

\spellsection{Assimilate}{9}
\spelldesc{Your pointing finger turns black as obsidian. You touch a creature and it dissolves into dust as you assimilate its form into your own body.}
\spellinfo{Necro/Trans (Augment, Life)}{Arcane, Evil}
\spelltwocol{\spelltgt{One living creature}}{\spellrng{\rngtouch}}
\spelldur{Instantaneous and one hour; see text}
\spellsr{Yes (Fortitude)}
\spellattack{Magic vs. Fortitude}
\begin{spellsuccess}
    18d8 life damage \add d6 per four caster levels above 18th. 
\end{spellsuccess}
\begin{spellfailure}
    As above, but half damage.
\end{spellfailure}
\begin{spelleffect}
    If the target has no hit points remaining after taking damage from this spell, it is entirely assimilated into your form, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. An assimilated creature's equipment is unaffected.
    \par If the creature has at least 1 hit point following your use of this power, you gain temporary hit points equal to half the damage you dealt for 1 hour.
    \par If the creature is completely assimilated, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the damage you dealt and a \plus4 enhancement bonus to each of your attributes for 1 hour. In addition, you gain the appearance of the creature for 1 hour, granting you a \plus10 enhancement bonus on Disguise checks made to appear as that creature during that time.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    If you take life damage, you lose all temporary hit points provided by this spell before applying the damage.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Aversion}{3}
\spelldesc{You make the subject want to avoid something.}
\spellinfo{Ench (Emotion) [Mind-Affecting]}{Ench}
\spelltwocol{\spelltgt{One creature}}{\spellrng{\rngmed}}
\spelldur{\durshort}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\spellattack{Magic vs. Will}
\begin{spellsuccess}
    An affected creature feels an aversion to a particular person or object. If the object of the implanted aversion is an individual or a physical object, she will prefer not to approach within 30 feet of it. If it is a word, she will try not to utter it; if it is an action, she will not willingly attempt to perform it; and if it is an event, she will not willingly attend it. The subject will take reasonable steps to avoid the object of its aversion, but will not put herself in jeopardy by doing so.
    \par If the subject is forced to take an action she has an aversion to, she takes a \minus4 penalty to attacks, defenses, and checks for 1 round.
\end{spellsuccess}

\spellcmp{Verbal, Somatic, and Focus}
\spelltwocol{\spelltgts{One creature/round}}{\spellrng{\rngmed}}
\spelldur{Concentration}
\begin{spelleffect}
    This spell functions like \spell{dismissal}, except that you can banish one additional extraplanar creature each round that you concentrate on the spell. An individual creature can only be targeted once per casting of this spell.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    You can improve the spell's chance of success by presenting at least one object or substance that the target hates, fears, or otherwise opposes. For each such object or substance, you gain a \plus2 bonus on your caster level with the spell. For example, if this spell were cast on a demon that hated light and was \vulnerable to holy water and cold iron weapons, you might use iron, holy water, and a torch in the spell. The three items would give you a \plus6 bonus on your caster level. 
    \par Certain rare items might work twice as well as a normal item for the purpose of the bonuses (each providing a \plus4 bonus to your caster level).
\end{spellnotes}
\spellfocus{Any item that is distasteful to the subject (optional, see above)}

\spellsection{Barkskin}{2}
\spelldesc{You toughen a creature's skin, giving it the appearance of tree bark.}

\spelldur{\durshort}
\spellsr{Yes (Fortitude)}
\begin{spelleffect}
    The subject gains a \plus2 enhancement bonus to its armor modifier. \spellbonusscalingdescription In addition, the subject gains physical damage reduction 2/adamantine or fire. This damage reduction increases by 1 per two caster levels above 4th.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    This spell's damage reduction allows the subject to ignore the first 2 physical damage it takes each round. If it is hit by a adamantine weapon or an attack that deals fire damage, it cannot use its damage reduction for 1 round.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Bestow Curse}{5}
\spelldesc{You place a curse on your foe, crippling its ability to act.}
\spellinfo{Necro (Life) [Curse]}{Death, Divine, Evil, Necro}

\spelldur{Permanent}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\spellattack{Magic vs. Will}
\begin{spellsuccess}

    \begin{itemize*}
        \item \minus6 penalty to an attribute.
        \item \minus4 penalty on attacks, defenses, and checks.
        \item Each turn, the target has a 25\% chance to take no action; otherwise, it acts normally.
    \end{itemize*}
    \par You may also invent your own curse, but it should be no more powerful than those described above.
\end{spellsuccess}
\begin{spellnotes}
    Curses cannot be dispelled.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Black Tentacles}{7}
\spelldesc{You conjure a field of rubbery black tentacles, each 5 feet long. These waving members seem to spring forth from the earth, floor, or whatever surface is underfoot -- including water. They grasp and entwine around creatures that enter the area, holding them fast and crushing them with great strength.}
\spellinfo{Conj/Trans (Animation, Creation)}{Arcane}
\spelltwocol{\spellzone{\areasmall radius}}{\spellrng{\rngmed}}
\spelldur{\durshort \dismissable}
\begin{spelleffect}
    At the end of each round, you make a grapple attack against every creature in the area that is within 5 feet of the ground. In addition, the entire area is considered difficult terrain.
\end{spelleffect}
\spellattack{Caster level \add casting attribute vs. Maneuver defense (grapple)}
\begin{spellsuccess}
    The target is grappled and takes 1d8\plus4 bludgeoning damage. It remains grappled until it escape the tentacle. The tentacle's Maneuver defense is equal to 10 \add your caster level \add your casting attribute.
\end{spellsuccess}
\begin{spellnotes}
    \par The tentacles are immune to all types of damage. The entire area of effect is considered difficult terrain while the tentacles last, and any creature that enters the area of the spell is immediately attacked by the tentacles.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Blade Barrier}{6}
\spelldesc{You create an immobile, vertical curtain of whirling blades shaped of pure force.}
\spellinfo{Evoc (Energy) [Force, Wall]}{Divine, War}

\spelldur{\durshort \dismissable}
\spellsr{Yes (Reflex)}
\begin{spelleffect}

\spellinfo{Necro (Flesh)}{Arcane, Divine, Death}
\spelltwocol{\spelltgt{One creature}}{\spellrng{\rngclose}}

\spellattack{Magic vs. Fortitude}

    If the subject becomes \bloodied, it is also \blinded for 1 round or \deafened for the duration of the spell, as you choose.
\end{spellsuccess}
\begin{spellnotes}
    The choice of bloodied conditions is made at the time the spell is cast.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Blink}{4}
\spelldesc{You rapidly blink in and out of reality, confounding your foes and protecting you from their attacks.}
\spellinfo{Conj (Translocation) [Planar]}{Arcane}
\spelltwocol{\spelltgt{You}}{\spellrng{\rngpers}}
\spelldur{\durshort \dismissable}
\begin{spelleffect}
    You ``blink" back and forth between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. This has several effects, as follows.
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item All attacks made against you and spells targeted on you have a 50\% chance to fail. This failure chance is reduced to 20\% if the attack can strike ethereal targets or if the attacker can see ethereal targets. If both are true, the attack suffers no chance of failure. Force effects can strike ethereal targets.
        \item You take half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane).
        \item You take half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.
        \item All of your attacks and spells have a 20\% chance to happen while you are in the Ethereal Plane, which usually means they have no effect.
        \item You can move at only three-quarters speed (because movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed, and you spend about half your time there and half your time material.)
        \item You can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50\% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 damage per 5 feet so traveled. 
        \item You can see and interact with ethereal creatures in roughly the same way you interact with material ones.
    \end{itemize*}
\end{spelleffect}

\spellsection{Blur}{2}
\spelldesc{You distort the subject's outline so it appears blurred, shifting, and wavering.}
\spellinfo{Illus (Glamer)}{Arcane}
\spelltwocol{\spelltgt{One creature}}{\spellrng{\rngclose}}

\begin{spelleffect}
    Other creatures take a \minus2 penalty on sight-based checks and physical attacks against the subject, such as Perception and Sense Motive checks.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    A \spell{see invisibility} spell does not counteract the blurring effect, but a \spell{true seeing} spell does.
\end{spellnotes}

\spelldur{Instantaneous and \durmed \dismissable; see text}
\spellsr{Yes (Reflex)}
\begin{spelleffect}
    When you cast this spell, and once per round thereafter, you may call down a vertical bolt of lightning. Calling a bolt is a standard action that requires concentration. You may call a total number of bolts equal to your caster level.
\end{spelleffect}
\spellattacktargets{Magic vs. Reflex}{Everything in the bolt's area}
\begin{spellsuccess}
    3d8 electricity damage \add d8 per four caster levels above 6th. If you are outdoors and in a stormy area -- a rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a tornado -- this deals 3d10 electricity damage \add d10 per four caster levels above 6th instead.

    Depending on the version you choose, the \spell{control water} spell raises or lowers water.
    \par \subspell{Lower Water} This causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by as much as 2 feet per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch). The water is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides are up to caster level \mtimes 10 feet long. In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell.
    \par \subspell{Raise Water} This causes water or similar liquid to rise in height, just as the lower water version causes it to lower. Boats raised in this way slide down the sides of the hump that the spell creates. If the area affected by the spell includes riverbanks, a beach, or other land nearby, the water can spill over onto dry land.

Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The noise a \spell{ghost sound} spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit, including speech. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting.

\spelldur{Instantaneous; see text}
\begin{spelleffect}
    You can use \spell{dispel magic} to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.
    \par Note: The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect. 
    \par You choose to use dispel magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell.

    \par \subspell{Targeted Dispel} One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make a single dispel check (1d20 \add your caster level) which applies against all spells or effects currently active on the target. The DC for this dispel check is 11 \add the caster level of the effect. Your check is compared against each effect's DC. If you succeed on the check, each effect with that DC is dispelled.

    \par If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning) and you succeed on your dispel check, you end the spell that conjured the object or creature.
    \par If the object that you target is a magic item, you compare your dispel check against the item's caster level. If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 5 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.
    \par You may choose to automatically succeed or fail on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.
    \par \subspell{Area Dispel} When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a \areamed radius.

    \par This functions as a targeted dispel against every creature, object, and ongoing spell in the area, except that you can only dispel one effect from each target in the area. The effect dispelled is the one with the highest spell level that your dispel check would succeed against. If multiple spells qualify, choose randomly. Attended magic items are unaffected by an area dispel.

    \par \subspell{Counterspell} When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.
\end{spelleffect}

\spellattack{Magic vs. Will}
\begin{spelleffect}
    You can control the actions of any humanoid creature through a telepathic link that you establish with the subject's mind.
    \par If you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as ``Come here," ``Go there," ``Fight," and ``Stand still." If you concentrate on the spell, you know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically.
    \par Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth). Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill description).
    It takes time for the link to be established. For the first hour after the spell is cast, you must concentrate on the spell (a standard action) to control the subject's actions. While you are not concentrating on the spell, the creature acts as if confused, as the \spell{confusion} spell, except that it never attacks you. If the subject would randomly attack you, it instead is forced to follow your commands. At the end of the hour, you must make a second Will attack. If you concentrate on the spell during this time, you gain a \plus4 bonus to the attack. If your attack succeeds, you dominate the creature fully for the remainder of the spell duration. Otherwise, the creature is freed.
    \par After the first hour, changing your instructions or giving a dominated creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.
    \par By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can't communicate with you. You can't actually see through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on.
    \par Subjects resist this control, and you must make a new attack to force the subject to take an action against its nature. Failure means it breaks free. This does not apply when a subject is merely ordered to perform an action it disagrees with -- the action must be directly opposed to the subject's beliefs. Ordering a paladin to murder an innocent would require a new attack, but ordering him to build a bridge that would allow an evil army to cross a river would not. If your command would obviously lead to the creature's death, your attack takes a \minus10 penalty. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control it.
    \par If you recast this spell on a subject you have dominated before it escapes your control, you can extend the duration of the spell indefinitely. You do not need to make a new attack when you renew your control in this fashion.

The subject can walk or climb at any angle in the earth. However, the subject generally cannot breathe, speak, or hear while gliding. While gliding, a creature can remain partially within the earth, granting it cover.

\spellattack{Magic vs. Reflex}
\begin{spelleffect}
    This spell has various effects, depending on the terrain. Regardless of the terrain, creatures on the ground can't move and take a \minus10 penalty to physical attacks. A spellcaster on the ground who attempts to cast a spell must make a Concentration check against a DC equal to (your attack result \add double the level of the spell being cast) or lose the spell. The specific effect of an earthquake spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.
    \par \subspell{Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel} The spell collapses the roof, dealing 8d8 bludgeoning damage \add d8 per four caster levels above 16th to any creature caught under the cave-in. If your attack is successful against a creature, it is pinned beneath the rubble, while a failed attack deals half damage. An earthquake cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris.
    \par \subspell{Cliffs} Earthquake causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it fell vertically. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 bludgeoning damage \add d6 per four caster levels above 16th. If your attack is successful against a creature, it is pinned beneath the rubble, while a failed attack deals half damage.
    \par \subspell{Open Ground} If your attack is successful against a creature, it falls prone. In addition, fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25\% chance to be above one. You make a magic attack vs. Reflex against each creature threatened by a fissure. A successful attack causes a creature to fall into the fissure. At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut, dealing 8d10 bludgeoning damage \add d10 per four caster levels above 16th to any creatures trapped in them and ejecting their bodies (dead or alive).
    \par \subspell{Structure} Any structure standing on open ground takes 10 damage per caster level, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 bludgeoning damage \add d6 per four caster levels above 16th. If your attack is successful against a creature, it is pinned beneath the rubble, while a failed attack deals half damage.
    \par \subspell{River, Lake, or Marsh} Fissures open underneath the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures.  If your attack is successful against a creature, it sinks ten feet beneath the surface, buried in the mud and quicksand. A DC 25 Climb or Swim check is required to escape. At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    A creature pinned beneath rubble is treated as being pinned. Each round, it can attempt to escape the pin as a standard action. Escaping requires a DC 20 Escape Artist check or grapple attack. As long as it stays pinned, it takes 1d6 nonlethal damage per minute. If a pinned creature falls unconscious, it takes 1d6 lethal damage each minute until it is freed or dies.

    This spell opens a portal to an Elemental Plane and summons elementals from it. A druid can choose the plane (Air, Earth, Fire, or Water); a cleric opens a portal to the plane matching his domain.
    \par When the spell is complete, 2d4 Large elementals appear. Five minutes later, 1d4 Huge elementals appear. Five minutes after that, one greater elemental appears. All creatures initially appear wherever you desire within the spell's area. Once these creatures appear, they serve you for the duration of the spell.
    \par The elementals obey you explicitly and never attack you, even if someone else manages to gain control over them. You do not need to concentrate to maintain control over the elementals. You can dismiss them singly or in groups at any time.

\spellattack{None, Physical vs. Reflex}
\begin{spelleffect}
    This spell functions like \spell{greater resist energy}, except that you store up the energy you absorb and can later discharge it as a ray. To discharge a ray requires a standard action. You can choose to fire any number of rays during the spell's duration. The ray you fire must be of one of the energy types you have stored (if you have stored more than one type, you can choose what kind of energy to use for each ray). If a ray successfully strikes its target (requiring a ranged touch attack vs. Reflex), the target takes damage equal to the amount of energy damage of that type you have stored, up to a maximum of three times your caster level. As long as this power remains in effect, you can continue to absorb energy damage and fire additional rays using the stored damage.
\end{spelleffect}

If the subject has at least as many negative levels as it has levels, it dies.
    \par An undead creature gains physical damage reduction 8/positive instead. This damage reduction increases by 1 per two caster levels above 8th.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    This spell stacks with any effect that bestows negative levels, including itself.

    The damage reduction allows an undead subject to ignore the first 8 physical damage it takes each round. If it is hit by a positive attack, such as \spell{cure light wounds}, it cannot use its damage reduction for 1 round.

\begin{spelleffect}
    This spell causes instant growth of a humanoid creature, doubling its height and multiplying its weight by 8. This increase changes the creature's size category to the next larger one. This has several effects.
    \begin{itemize*} 
        \item \plus10 ft. bonus to movement speed.
        \item \plus4 bonus to maneuver attack and defense.
        \item \minus1 penalty to other physical attacks and defenses.
        \item \minus2 penalty to Dexterity.
        \item \plus2 enhancement bonus to Strength.
        \item \minus4 penalty to Stealth checks.
    \end{itemize*}
    \par A humanoid creature whose size increases to Large has a space of 10 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet.
    \par If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it -- the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size.
    \par All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly enlarged by the spell. Melee and projectile weapons affected by this spell deal more damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any enlarged item that leaves an enlarged creature's possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage, and projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them. Magical properties of enlarged items are not increased by this spell.
    \par This spell cannot increase a creature beyond Gargantuan size.

    \par An ethereal creature is invisible, insubstantial, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down, albeit at half normal speed. As an insubstantial creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear on the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and ephemeral. Sight and hearing onto the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.
    \par Force effects and abjurations affect an ethereal creature normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane (such as a basilisk's gaze attack). Treat other ethereal creatures and ethereal objects as if they were material.

    Fog spells do not function underwater and can be dispersed by wind. A moderate wind (11\add mph) disperses the fog in 5 rounds; a strong wind (21\add mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.

\spellattack{Magic vs. Reflex}
\begin{spelleffect}
    This powerful spell brings into being an immobile, invisible cubical prison composed of either bars of force or solid walls of force (your choice). You make a magic attack vs. Reflex against any creature adjacent to the cage when it is formed. A failed attack allows the creature to disrupt the cage, preventing it from being formed in any squares adjacent to the creature. The rest of the cage is formed regardless.
    \par Creatures in the area are caught and contained unless they are too big to fit inside, in which case the spell automatically fails. Teleportation and other forms of astral travel provide a means of escape, but the force walls or bars extend into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.
    \par Like a \spell{wall of force} spell, a forcecage resists \spell{dispel magic}, but it is vulnerable to a \spell{disintegrate} spell, and it can be destroyed by a \magicitem{sphere of annihilation} or a \magicitem{rod of cancellation}.
    \par \subspell{Barred Cage} This version of the spell produces a 20-foot cube made of bands of force (similar to a \spell{wall of force} spell) for bars. The bands are a half-inch wide, with half-inch gaps between them. Any creature capable of passing through such a small space can escape; others are confined. You can't attack a creature in a barred cage with a weapon unless the weapon can fit between the gaps. Even against such weapons (including arrows and similar ranged attacks), a creature in the barred cage has cover. All spells and breath weapons can pass through the gaps in the bars.
    \par \subspell{Windowless Cell} This version of the spell produces a 10-foot cube with no way in and no way out. Solid walls of force form its six sides.

\begin{spelleffect}
    The subject and all its gear become insubstantial, misty, and translucent. Its armor modifier becomes 0, though other defense modifiers continue to apply normally. The subject gains physical damage reduction 10/magic and becomes immune to critical hits. It can't attack or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material, or focus components while in gaseous form. (This does not rule out the use of certain spells that the subject may have prepared using the feats Silent Spell or Still Spell.) If it has a touch spell ready to use, that spell is discharged harmlessly when the gaseous form spell takes effect.
    \par A gaseous creature can fly at a speed of 10 feet (special maneuverability). It can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with all it was wearing or holding in its hands, as long as the spell persists. The creature is subject to the effects of wind, and it can't enter water or other liquid. It also can't manipulate objects or activate items, even those carried along with its gaseous form. Continuously active items remain active, though in some cases their effects may be moot.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    This spell's damage reduction allows the subject to ignore the first 10 physical damage it takes each round. If it is hit by a magical attack, such as a damaging spell or magic weapon, it cannot use its damage reduction for 1 round.

    A creature with a glide speed can glide through the air at the indicated speed. It must be unencumbered (see \pcref{Encumbrance}).

    While in the air, a creature with a glide speed can control its fall as a move action. This allows it to move up to its speed horizontally in a direction of its choice while moving only five feet down. If it desires, it can move half as far horizontally and fall down twice as fast. It takes no falling damage if it touches the ground while gliding.

    You turn three normal-sized centipedes, two normal-sized spiders, or a single normal-sized scorpion into Large-sized forms. Only one type of vermin can be transmuted (so a single casting cannot affect both a centipede and a spider), and all must be grown to the same size.
    \par Any giant vermin created by this spell do not attempt to harm you, but your control of such creatures is limited to simple commands (``Attack," ``Defend," ``Stop," and so forth). Orders to attack a certain creature when it appears or guard against a particular occurrence are too complex for the vermin to understand. Unless commanded to do otherwise, the giant vermin attack whoever or whatever is near them.

All in the area at the time that the spell is cast are covered by the dust, which continues to sparkle until it fades.

\begin{spelleffect}
    This spell functions like \spell{interposing hand}, except the hand can also grapple foes. Each round, as a swift action, you can command the hand to grapple a foe. If you do, it makes a grapple attack against that foe during the action phase. Its attack bonus equals your caster level \add your casting attribute (the hand's Strength) \add 4 (for being Large). Its Maneuver defense is equal to 10 \add the same modifier.
    \par The hand holds but does not harm creatures it grapples. While the hand is grappling a foe, you must spend a swift action each round to command the hand to sustain the grapple; otherwise, the grappled creature escapes automatically.
    \par If you do not direct the hand to grapple, it simply provides cover as \spell{interposing hand}.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    The floating hand can move as far as 60 feet and can attack in the same round. Since this hand is directed by you, its ability to notice or attack invisible or concealed creatures is no better than yours.

    \par In addition to the effects noted, a gust of wind can do anything that a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do. It can extinguish open flames, create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings or hangings, heel over a small boat, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of its range.

\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    The extra attack granted is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a weapon of speed, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.

    \par In addition, for every 10 points of healing granted by the spell, it can instead cure 1 point of critical damage.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    \spell{Heal} does not remove negative levels, restore permanently drained levels, or restore permanently drained attribute points.

    If the creature is touching the ground, it becomes permanently entombed in a state of suspended animation (as the \spell{temporal stasis} spell) in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the earth.

    A slowed creature can take only a single move action or standard action each turn, but not both. It cannot take full-round actions, but it may take swift actions. Additionally, it takes a \minus2 penalty to physical attacks and defenses, as well as Strength and Dexterity-based checks.

    The subject must be \bloodied at the time that the spell is cast to be imprisoned. Magical search by a crystal ball, a \spell{locate creature} spell, or some other similar divination does not reveal the fact that a creature is imprisoned, but \spell{discern location} does.

\begin{spelleffect}
    This spell creates a floating, disembodied hand made of magical force. The hand stays between you and one opponent, providing you with active cover from that creature. Each physical attack that creature makes against you has a 20\% chance to strike the hand instead. In addition, if the creature is Large size or smaller, it moves at half speed while moving towards you. 
    \par If you cannot see the hand's target, it will stop moving until it is directed to a visible target. The hand does not pursue opponents.
    \par An interposing hand is 10 feet long and about that wide with its fingers outstretched. It has 3 hit points per caster level, and a physical defense of 15 (\minus1 size, \plus6 natural armor). It takes damage as a normal creature, but most effects that don't cause damage do not affect it.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    \par The hand never provokes attacks of opportunity from opponents. It cannot push through a \spell{wall of force} or enter an \spell{antimagic field}, but it suffers the full effect of a \spell{prismatic wall} or \spell{prismatic sphere}. The hand's defenses are the same as its caster.

\begin{spellsuccess}
    The creature or object touched becomes invisible, vanishing from sight, even from darkvision. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too.
    \par Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 5 feet from it becomes visible.
    \par Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle). The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions.) Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as \spell{bless} that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.

    \par Those affected by this spell can see each other and themselves as if unaffected by the spell. Any affected creature moving out of the area becomes visible, but creatures moving into the area after the spell is cast do not become invisible.

You are immune to blindness, critical hits, attribute damage, deafness, disease, drowning, electricity, poison, stunning, and all spells or attacks that affect your physiology or respiration, because you have no physiology or respiration while this spell is in effect. You take only half damage from acid and fire of all kinds.
    \par You gain a \plus5 enhancement bonus to your Strength score, but you take a \minus5 penalty to Dexterity as well, and your speed is reduced to half normal. You have a \minus8 armor check penalty. You cannot drink (and thus can't use potions) or play wind instruments.
    \par Your unarmed attacks deal damage equal to a warhammer sized for you (1d6 for Small characters or 1d8 for Medium characters), and you are considered armed when making unarmed attacks.
    \par Your weight increases by a factor of ten, causing you to sink in water like a stone. However, you could survive the crushing pressure and lack of air at the bottom of the ocean -- at least until the spell duration expires.
\end{spelleffect}

In addition, if the object is locked, you can immediately make a Disable Device check to open the lock as if you had rolled a 20 on the check.

\begin{spelleffect}
    A limited wish lets you create nearly any type of effect. For example, a limited wish can do any of the following things.
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Duplicate any general sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.
        \item Duplicate any general sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th level or lower, even if it's of a prohibited school.
        \item Duplicate any other spell of 4th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.
        \item Duplicate any other spell of 3rd level or lower, even if it's of a prohibited school.
        \item Undo the harmful effects of many spells, such as geas/quest or insanity.
        \item Produce any other effect whose power level is in line with the above effects, such as a single creature automatically hitting on its next attack or taking a \minus5 penalty to its defenses for 5 rounds.
    \end{itemize*}
    \par When casting a limited wish, you do not specify the exact spell or effect you wish to duplicate. Instead, you make a wish, describing what you want to have happen, and make a DC 15 Wisdom check. If the check fails, your intent is redirected or perverted in some way. For example, a \spell{limited wish} to turn a foe to stone would normally mimic the \spell{flesh to stone} effect of the \spell{transmute flesh and stone} spell. However, if the Wisdom check failed, your foe might gain the benefit of a \spell{stoneskin} spell instead.
    \par When a limited wish spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 1,000 gp, you must provide that component (in addition to the 1,000 gp cost for this spell).

\begin{spelleffect}
    All magical effects within the radius of the spell, except for those on you, are disjoined. That is, spells and spell-like effects are separated into their individual components (ending the effect as a \spell{dispel magic} spell does).
    \par You also have a 2\% chance per caster level of destroying an \spell{antimagic field}.
    \par You can also use this spell to target a single item. If you succeed at a Will attack with a \plus5 bonus, the item is permanently rendered nonmagical. Even artifacts are subject to this use of disjunction, though there is only a 1\% chance per caster level of actually affecting such powerful items. Additionally, if an artifact is destroyed, you permanently lose the ability to cast \spell{mage's disjunction}. (This ability cannot be recovered by mortal magic, not even \spell{miracle} or \spell{wish}.)
    \par \subspell{Note} Destroying artifacts is a dangerous business, and it is 95\% likely to attract the attention of some powerful being who has an interest in or connection with the device.

\begin{spellnotes}
    You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike (instead, see \spell{magic fang}). A monk's unarmed strike is considered a weapon, and thus it can be enhanced by this spell.
    \par If you use this spell to enhance projectiles, the projectiles must be of the same kind, and they have to be together (in the same quiver or other container).

\begin{spelleffect}
    You banish the subject into an extradimensional labyrinth of force planes. Each round on its turn, it may attempt an Intelligence check to escape the labyrinth as a full-round action. You make a Will attack to attempt to place it in the middle of the labyrinth. A successful attack means the DC of the Intelligence check is 20, while a failed attack means the DC is 15. If the subject doesn't escape, the maze disappears after 5 minutes, forcing the subject back to the location where it was originally banished.
    \par On escaping or leaving the maze, the subject reappears where it had been when the maze spell was cast. If this location is filled with a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest open space.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as \spell{teleport} and \spell{dimension door}, do not help a creature escape a \spell{maze} spell, although a \spell{plane shift} spell allows it to exit to whatever plane is designated in that spell.

    This spell enables you to meld your body and possessions into a single block of stone. The stone must be large enough to accommodate your body in all three dimensions. When the casting is complete, you and not more than 100 pounds of nonliving gear merge with the stone. If either condition is violated, the spell fails and is wasted.
    \par While in the stone, you remain in contact, however tenuous, with the face of the stone through which you melded. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while hiding in the stone. Nothing that goes on outside the stone can be seen, but you can still hear what happens around you. Minor physical damage to the stone does not harm you, but its partial destruction (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. If the stone is completely destroyed, you are expelled, and you die unless your Fortitude defense is at least 20.
    \par Any time before the duration expires, you can step out of the stone through the surface that you entered. If the spell's duration expires or the effect is dispelled before you voluntarily exit the stone, you are violently expelled and take 5d6 points of damage.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    The following spells harm you if cast upon the stone that you are occupying: \spell{transmute flesh and stone} expels you and deals 6d6 points of damage. \spellindirect{shape stone}{Shape stone} deals 3d6 points of damage but does not expel you. \spell{Passwall} expels you without damage.

    You can whisper messages and receive whispered replies with little chance of being overheard. You point your finger at each creature you want to receive the message. When you whisper, the whispered message is audible to all targeted creatures within range. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal (or a thin sheet of lead), or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks the spell. The message does not have to travel in a straight line. It can circumvent a barrier if there is an open path between you and the subject, and the path's entire length lies within the spell's range. The creatures that receive the message can whisper a reply that you hear. The spell transmits sound, not meaning. It doesn't transcend language barriers.

Once per minute, you make a Will attack against all creatures in the area to impose a \minus5 penalty to Wisdom. Affected creatures take the penalty as long as they remain in the fog and for 5 rounds thereafter. The fog is stationary and lasts for 1 hour (or until dispersed by wind).
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    A moderate wind (11\add mph) disperses the fog in 5 rounds; a strong wind (21\add mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. The penalty to Wisdom imposed by this spell does not stack with itself.

\begin{spelleffect}
    You don't so much cast a miracle as request one. You state what you would like to have happen and request that your deity (or the power you pray to for spells) intercede.
    \par A miracle can do any of the following things.
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Duplicate any cleric spell of 8th level or lower (including spells to which you have access because of your domains). 
        \item Duplicate any other spell of 7th level or lower.
        \item Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as feeblemind or insanity.
        \item Have any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.
    \end{itemize*}
    \par Alternatively, a cleric can make a very powerful request. Examples of especially powerful miracles of this sort could include the following.
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Swiinging the tide of a battle in your favor by raising fallen allies to continue fighting.
        \item Moving you and your allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to another through planar barriers to a specific locale with no chance of error.
        \item Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster.
    \end{itemize*}
    \par In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity's (or alignment's) nature is refused.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    If you request a miracle, your deity (or the power you pray to) will expect something of you in return. You must cast commune to learn what this is within 24 hours, or you will lose the ability to cast any cleric spells other than commune. For more moderate miracles, you may be required to offer 25,000gp worth of incense and gems. For especially powerful miracles, or multiple moderate miracles, you may geased with a task to complete.
    \par When a miracle spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 5,000 gp, you must provide that component.

\spelldur{\durshort \dismissable}
\begin{spelleffect}
    This spell creates an illusory duplicate of yourself that mimics your movements perfectly. Enemies attempting to attack you or cast spells at you must select which to attack. Generally, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. An image's physical defenses are 10 \add its size modifier. You gain an additional image at 8th, 14th, and 20th caster level. 
    \par If an image is hit, it is destroyed. If you are hit, your attacker knows the attack was successful, and can ignore the image. You can create new images to replace destroyed images as a swift action, preventing your foes from knowing which image to attack.
    \par You can move into and through your duplicates on your turn. When you and the image separate, observers can't use vision or hearing to tell which one is you and which the image. The duplicates may also move through each other. The figments mimic your actions, pretending to cast spells when you cast a spell, drink potions when you drink a potion, levitate when you levitate, and so on.
    \par Mirror images can be attacked like any other creature. They count as separate creatures, and can be targeted separately by spells like \spell{magic missile} or feats like Whirlwind Attack, though they are not destroyed by area spells. Destroying an image counts as dropping a creature for the purpose of the Cleave feat and similar abilities.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    An attacker must be able to see the images to be fooled. If you are invisible or an attacker shuts his or her eyes, the spell has no effect. (Being unable to see means you are blinded.)

\begin{spelleffect}
    You become invisible (as \spell{invisibility}, a glamer), and at the same time, an illusory double of you (as \spell{major image}, an unreal figment) appears. You are then free to go elsewhere while your double moves away. The double appears within range but thereafter moves as you direct it (which requires concentration beginning on the first round after the casting). You can make the figment appear superimposed perfectly over your own body so that observers don't notice an image appearing and you turning invisible. You and the figment can then move in different directions. The double moves at your speed and can talk and gesture as if it were real, but it cannot attack or cast spells, though it can pretend to do so.
    \par The illusory double lasts as long as you concentrate upon it, plus 5 additional rounds. After you cease concentration, the illusory double continues to carry out the same activity until the duration expires. The invisibility lasts for 5 minutes, regardless of concentration.

Alternately, you can expend the spell to protect yourself. If you do, you gain a bonus to your dodge modifier equal to half your caster level, and you stop being unaware of an attack if you were.

    \par You can pass into and out of the prismatic sphere and remain near it without harm. However, the sphere blocks any attempt to project something through it (including spells). Other creatures that attempt to attack you or pass through suffer the effects of each color, one at a time. You can fight from partially within the sphere. If you do, you gain cover from anyone outside the sphere.
    \par Typically, only the upper hemisphere of the globe will exist, since it is created with you at the center, so the lower half is usually excluded by the floor surface you are standing on.

\begin{spelleffect}
    This spell creates a vertical, opaque wall -- a shimmering, multicolored plane of light that protects you from all forms of attack. The wall flashes with seven colors, each of which has a distinct power and purpose. The wall is immobile, and you can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. However, any other creature with less than 8 levels that is within 20 feet of the wall is blinded for 1 minute by the colors if it looks at the wall.
    \par The wall's maximum proportions are 50 feet wide and 30 feet high. A \spell{prismatic wall} spell cast to materialize in a space occupied by a creature is disrupted, and the spell is wasted.
    \par Each color in the wall has a special effect. \trefnp{Prismatic Wall Colors} shows the seven colors of the wall, the order in which they appear, their effects on creatures trying to attack you or pass through the wall, and the magic needed to negate each color.
    \par The wall can be destroyed, color by color, in consecutive order, by various magical effects; however, the first color must be brought down before the second can be affected, and so on. A rod of cancellation or a mage's disjunction spell destroys a prismatic wall, but an antimagic field fails to penetrate it. Dispel magic and greater dispel magic cannot dispel the wall or anything beyond it. Spell resistance is effective against a prismatic wall, but the caster level check must be repeated for each color present.

    When you cast this spell, you choose an action. Whenever a creature in the area intentionally attempts to take the chosen action, you make a Will attack against them. A successful attack means they are unable to complete the action, while a failed attack means they take half damage. Any individual creature can only be affected by the \spell{prohibition} once per round.

    You may choose any action that must be taken intentionally. For example, you could prohibit creatures from attacking, but not from breathing. Likewise, you cannot prohibit actions that have non-voluntary components, such as ``protecting yourself with natural armor''.

\begin{spelleffect}
    You tap energy from the Plane of Shadow to create a quasi-real, illusory version of yourself. The projected image looks, sounds, and smells like you but is intangible. The projected image mimics your actions (including speech) unless you direct it to act differently (which is a move action).
    \par You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were standing where it is, and during your turn you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again, as a swift action. While you are using its senses, your body is considered blinded and deafened.
    \par If you desire, any spell you cast whose range is touch or greater can originate from the projected image instead of from you. The projected image can't cast any spells on itself except for illusion spells. The spells affect other targets normally, despite originating from the projected image.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    Objects are always considered to disbelieve this spell.
    \par You must maintain line of effect to the projected image at all times. If your line of effect is obstructed, the spell ends. If you use \spell{dimension door}, \spell{teleport}, \spell{plane shift}, or a similar spell that breaks your line of effect, even momentarily, the spell ends.

\begin{spelleffect}
    This spell causes instant diminution of a humanoid creature, halving its height, length, and width and dividing its weight by 8. This decrease changes the creature's size category to the next smaller one. This has several effects.
    \begin{itemize*} 
        \item \minus10 ft. penalty to movement speed.
        \item \minus4 penalty to maneuver attack and defense.
        \item \plus1 bonus to other physical attacks and defenses.

        \item \plus2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity.
        \item \plus4 bonus to Stealth checks.
    \end{itemize*}
    \par A Small humanoid creature whose size decreases to Tiny has a space of 2-1/2 feet and a natural reach of 0 feet (meaning that it must enter an opponent's square to attack). A Large humanoid creature whose size decreases to Medium has a space of 5 feet and a natural reach of 5 feet.
    \par All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly reduced by the spell. Melee and projectile weapons deal less damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any reduced item that leaves the reduced creature's possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage (projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them).

Any creature within or entering the field who cannot resist your attack is unable to move towards you that round.

    Repelled creatures' actions are not otherwise restricted. They can fight other creatures and can cast spells and attack you with ranged weapons. The creature is free to make melee attacks against you if you come within reach. If a repelled creature moves away from you and then tries to turn back toward you, it cannot move any closer if it is still within the spell's area.
\end{spelleffect}

    This spell reverses gravity in an area, causing all unattached objects and creatures within that area to fall upward and reach the top of the area in 1 round. If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it in the same manner as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, until the spell ends. At the end of the spell duration, affected objects and creatures fall downward.
  %an initiative check belongs here \par A creature caught in the area can attempt a Reflex save to react to the shift in gravity. Common reactions include securing oneself if possible, or jumping to reach more stable ground.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    Creatures who can fly or levitate can keep themselves from falling, though the shift in gravity can be disorienting. A creature that reacts by jumping does not actually move until its turn, but it moves in the direction of its jump, rather than simply falling upwards.

However, the spell must be cast within one round of the creature's death per four caster levels. After that time, it has no effect (and the material components are not consumed).

    The creature has 0 hit points and 1 point of critical damage (but is stable) after being restored to life.

\begin{spelleffect}
    This spell functions like \spell{enlarge person}, except that it affects only you, regardless of your creature type, and does not penalize your Dexterity. In addition, you gain physical damage reduction equal to 10 \add 1 per two caster levels above 10th. This damage reduction is overcome by evil attacks if you are good or neutral, and by good attacks if you are evil.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    This spell's damage reduction allows the subject to ignore the first 10 physical damage it takes each round. If it is hit by an attack that deals appropriately aligned damage, such as a weapon affected by \spell{align weapon} or a spell with the appropriate descriptor, it cannot use its damage reduction for 1 round.
    Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack.

    If the subject takes any offensive action, the spell immediately ends.

\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    This is considered a mind-affecting effect on any creature that attempts to attack the subject. Creatures immune to mind-affecting effects can attack the subject freely.

    You make a Reflex attack against the target to deal damage and dazzle it for 1 round. You deal extra damage equal to your caster level to undead creatures and to creatures particularly vulnerable to bright light. If you hit an undead creature particularly vulnerable to bright light, you deal extra damage equal to twice your caster level, and the creature is blinded for 1 round instead of being dazzled.

\end{spelleffect}

    Your body and all your equipment are subsumed by your shadow. As a living shadow, you blend perfectly into any other shadow and vanish in darkness. You appear as an unattached shadow in areas of full light.
    \par You can move at your normal speed, on any surface, including walls and ceilings, as well as across the surfaces of liquids -- even up the face of a waterfall.
    \par You become perfectly flat, potentially allowing you to move into locations you would not normally be able to move into.
    \par While in your shadow body, you gain damage reduction 15/solar and darkvision out to 60 feet. You are immune to ability damage, disease, drowning, and poison. You take only half damage from acid, electricity, and fire of all kinds.
    \par While affected by this spell, you can be detected by spells that read thoughts, life, or presences (including true seeing), or if you make suspicious movements in lighted areas.
    \par You cannot harm anyone physically or manipulate any objects, but you can use your spells normally. Doing so may attract notice, but if you remain in a shadowed area, you get a \plus15 enhancement bonus on your Hide check to remain unnoticed.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    This spell's damage reduction allows the subject to ignore the first 15 physical damage it takes each round. If it is hit by an attack that deals solar damage, such as \spell{sunbeam}, it cannot use its damage reduction for 1 round.

    Shadow conjuration can mimic any non-restricted sorcerer or wizard conjuration spell of 5th level or lower. If you summon a creature, as with the \spell{summon monster} spells, you may only summon a creature that you know how to summon with such a spell.
    \par When you cast this spell, you make a Will attack in addition to any other attacks required for the spell. This attack is made against any creature that interacts with the conjured object, force, or creature. If you fail, the creature disbelieves the spell.
    \par A creature that disbelieves the spell takes only half damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is half as strong (if applicable) or only half as likely to occur.
    \par A shadow creature has half the hit points of a normal creature of its kind (regardless of whether it's disbelieved). It deals normal damage and has all normal abilities and weaknesses. Against a creature that recognizes it as a shadow creature, however, the shadow creature deals half damage, and all special abilities that do not deal lethal damage are only 50\% likely to work. (Roll for each use separately.)
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    A creature that disbelieves the effect sees the shadow conjurations as transparent images superimposed on vague, shadowy forms.
    \par When you learn this spell, you choose two creatures from the 5th-level list or lower on \tref{Summon Monster List}. You can summon those creatures with this or any \spell{summon monster} spell.

    \par When you cast this spell, you make a Will attack in addition to any other attacks required for the spell. This attack is made against any creature that interacts with the conjured object, force, or creature. If you fail, the creature disbelieves the spell.
    \par A creature that disbelieves the spell takes only half damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is half as strong (if applicable) or only half as likely to occur.

\begin{spelleffect}
    You step into the Plane of Shadow (as \spell{shadow walk}, a planar translocation effect), and at the same time, you create a quasi-real, illusory version of yourself (as \spell{project image}, an unreal shadow effect). The double appears superimposed over your body so that observers don't notice an image appearing and you disappearing. You can then control the image and cast spells through it even though you are on a different plane.
\end{spelleffect}

\spelldur{\durshort}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
    The subject is protected by a shadowy umbra that connects directly to the Plane of Shadow. All attacks that would affect the creature, including magical and supernatural attacks, have a 50\% chance to be absorbed by the umbra. Attacks absorbed by the umbra have no effect on the subject. The umbra is selective, and does not inhibit beneficial effects.

    Whenever the umbra absorbs an attack, it alters the creature's appearance (including smell, sound, and other senses, as appropriate) with a glamer. This causes the creature to seem as if were affected by the attack. Outside observers have no way of knowing which attacks were absorbed by the umbra unless they can disbelieve the illusion. The spell does not attempt to conceal extraordinary attacks which cannot be disguised, such as attacks which would destroy the creature's body.

\begin{spelleffect}
    This spell creates a connection between you and a willing subject. As you cast the spell, you decide which creature will be protected. When the protected creature would take damage to its hit points, it instead takes half of that damage (rounded down), and you lose hit points equal to the other half of the damage (rounded up).

    If the subject is out of range of you, the effect is suppressed until the subject returns within the spell's range.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    The loss of hit points caused by this spell is not damage, and is not affected by damage reduction or other abilities which affect damage. When this spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between the subject and you, but damage already shared is not reassigned.

\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    A staggered character may take a single move action or standard action each round, but not both. She cannot take full-round actions, but she may take swift actions. In addition, she is \vulnerable, causing her to take a \minus2 penalty on attacks, defenses, and checks.

\spellattack{Magic vs. Will (object)}
\begin{spelleffect}
    You are able to shrink one nonmagical item to 1/16 of its normal size in each dimension (to about 1/4,000 the original volume and mass). This change effectively reduces the object's size by four categories. Optionally, you can also change its now shrunken composition to a clothlike one. Objects changed by a \spell{shrink item} spell can be returned to normal composition and size merely by tossing them onto any solid surface or by a word of command from the original caster. The object must be resting on a stable surface to return to its original size; if the command word is spoken while the object is not stable (such as while it is in the air), the object returns to its original size as soon as it finds a resting point. Even a burning fire and its fuel can be shrunk by this spell. Restoring the shrunken object to its normal size and composition ends the spell.
    \par You can shrink a Medium object at 8th caster level, a Large object at 12th caster level, a Huge object at 16th caster level, or a Gargantuan object at 24th caster level.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    This spell can be made permanent with a \spell{permanency} ritual, in which case the affected object can be shrunk and expanded an indefinite number of times, but only by the original caster. If you recast the spell each day on an object, you can keep it at its small size indefinitely.

    If you succeed on a Will attack, the subject becomes unable to make noise. Any noises it makes are inaudible to other creatures. When you cast the spell, you may choose whether the subject can still hear itself normally, potentially causing it to be unaware of the effect of the spell.

    Extraordinarily loud noises, such as the yell of a giant or a sonic attack, are merely muffled by the spell, not completely silenced. The DC to hear such sounds produced by the subject is increased by 40.

\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    When you cast this spell, you make a magic check, with the same bonus as your magic attack bonus. This check is opposed by the Will defense of any creature that interacts with the effect.

The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into solid fog is slowed, so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces falling damage by 1d6.
    \par A creature in the fog can take a full-round action to make a Strength check, moving 5 feet for every 5 by which the result exceeds DC 0. This movement is affected by any other effects which impede movement, as normal.

    This spell causes all creatures in the area to turn on each other rather than attack their foes. Each affected creature has a 50\% chance to attack the nearest target each round. (Roll to determine each creature's behavior every round at the beginning of its turn.) A creature that does not attack its nearest neighbor is free to act normally for that round. After each round that a subject is compelled to attack the nearest target, it may make a saving throw to throw off the effect.

    Spells and spell-like effects targeted on you are turned back upon the original caster. The abjuration turns only spells that have you as a target. Effect and area spells are not affected. Spell turning also fails to stop touch range spells. 
    \par From seven to ten (1d4\plus6) spell levels are affected by the turning. The exact number is rolled secretly.
    \par When you are targeted by a spell of higher level than the amount of spell turning you have left, that spell is partially turned; both you and the caster each take half damage. For all effects other than damage, there is a 50\% chance that you suffer the effects; otherwise, the caster suffers the effects.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    If you and a spellcasting attacker are both shielded by spell turning effects in operation, a resonating field is created.

\begin{spelleffect}
    Any ground-covering vegetation in the spell's area becomes very hard and sharply pointed. In areas of bare earth, roots and rootlets act in the same way. Typically, spike growth can be cast in any outdoor setting except open water, ice, heavy snow, sandy desert, or bare stone. Any foe moving on foot into or through the spell's area takes 1d4 points of physical piercing damage for each 5 feet of movement through the spiked area. Allies suffer no ill effects.

    Whenever a creature is damaged by this spell, you make a Fortitude attack against it. A successful attack makes slows its land speed by one-half. This speed penalty lasts for 12 hours or until the injured creature receives magical healing. Another character can remove the penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the injuries and succeeding on a Heal check that beats your Fortitude attack.

\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
    The weapon created by this spell attacks once each round on your turn. This functions just as if you were attacking with the weapon, except that you use your casting ability in place of your Strength and you never get multiple attacks with the weapon.
    \par The weapon attacks the same target until you redirect it (a swift action). The weapon is treated as a separate creature for the purpose of overwhelm penalties.
    \par If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a spell penetration check the first time the spiritual weapon strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, it cannot harm that creature. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.
    \par The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you (see below), and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    The \spell{spiritual weapon} strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so, for example, ignores physical damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the normal miss chance associated with incorporeality. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers. Even if the spiritual weapon is a ranged weapon, use the spell's range, not the weapon's normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action.
    \par A \spell{spiritual weapon} cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but \spell{dispel magic}, \spell{disintegrate}, and similar effects can affect it. A spiritual weapon's physical defenses are all 12 (10 \add \plus2 bonus for Tiny size).
    \par The weapon that you get is usually a force replica of any weapon from your deity's weapon group. A cleric without a deity gets a weapon based on his alignment. A neutral cleric without a deity can create a spiritual weapon of any alignment, provided he is acting at least generally in accord with that alignment at the time. The weapon groups associated with each alignment are as follows.
    \par Chaos: Axes
    \par Evil: Flexible weapons
    \par Good: Headed weapons
    \par Law: Heavy blades

    This spell summons a stampede of nine bison to trample your foes. Creatures trampled by the herd of bison take 1d6 damage per bison in the herd. You can summon one additional bison per four caster levels above 18th.
    \par The bison are summoned in a place that you designate within the spell's area, with each creature being summoned in the closest free space to the point of origin. If there is insufficient room for all of the bison to appear while standing on stable ground, the spell will summon fewer bison than the maximum. The herd of bison always moves directly away from you, trampling anything of Large size or smaller that gets in their way. If the herd is thinned to fewer than 5 bison, they stop stampeding and scatter in random directions.
    \par The bison do not attack, even if cornered; they will only stampede. At the end of the spell's duration, the bison disappear.

The condition lasts as long as the creature remains in the cloud and for 5 rounds after it leaves.

\end{spelleffect}

\begin{spelleffect}
    This spell creates an enormous black storm cloud. Lightning and crashing claps of thunder appear within the storm. You make a Fortitude attack to deafen each creature beneath the cloud for 5 minutes. Violent rain and wind gusts obscure all sight beyond 100 feet. A creature less than 100 feet away has concealment (\plus4 to physical defenses). Ranged attacks in the area of the storm take a \minus4 penalty, and spells cast in the area are disrupted unless the caster succeeds on a Concentration check against a DC equal to 20 \add double the level of the spell.
    \par If you do not maintain concentration on the spell after casting it, the spell ends. If you continue to concentrate, the spell generates new effects in each following round, as noted below. Each effect occurs during your turn.
    \par 2nd Round: Acid rains down, dealing 1d10 acid damage to everything in the area.
    \par 3rd Round: You call three bolts of lightning down from the cloud. You decide where the bolts strike. No two bolts may strike the same target. Each bolt deals 9d6 electricity damage \add d6 per four caster levels above 18th. You make a Reflex attack to deal damage to each creature in the path of the bolt. A failed attack deals half damage. If you do not direct the lightning bolts, each bolt automatically targets the largest available target in the area.
    \par 4th Round: Hailstones rain down, dealing 5d6 bludgeoning damage to all enemies in the area.
    \par 5th through 10th Rounds: Acid rains down, dealing 1d10 damage to everything in the area.

In addition, you can make a Fortitude attack to deal damage to any creature that strikes you with its body or a melee weapon. A failed attack deals half damage. Each individual creature can take this damage only once per round.
\end{spelleffect}

    You influence the actions of the target creature by suggesting a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two). The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do some obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell. Additionally, any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the fascinated creature, grants the creature a new saving throw with a \plus5 bonus.
    \par The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell duration expires, the activity is not performed.
\end{spelleffect}

    A very reasonable suggestion can grant a \plus2 or greater bonus on the Will attack. A creature that resists this spell is immune to all further attempts by the same spellcaster for 24 hours.

    This spell summons an extraplanar creature (typically an outsider, elemental, or magical beast native to another plane). It appears where you designate and acts on your next turn.

You are free to act for 1d3\plus1 rounds of apparent time. You are still \vulnerable to danger, such as from heat or dangerous gases, but your actions have no effect on anything in the world other than yourself. Objects and creatures appear frozen in place. You cannot cast spells that affect any targets except yourself; the temporal magic is too strong to permit interference from lesser magic, and attempts to cast magic beyond the accelerated time surrounding you simply fail. The only exception is for temporal spells, which can be cast normally inside a \spell{time stop}. The subjects are not affected and do not attempt to resist the effects until the end of the \spell{time stop}, so you do not know whether they are affected by any spells you cast until the effect has expired.
\end{spelleffect}

    Most spellcasters use the additional time to improve their defenses or flee from combat. You are undetectable while \spell{time stop} lasts. You cannot enter an area protected by an \spell{antimagic field} while under the effect of \spell{time stop}.

    You become able to assume the form of a Large living tree or shrub or a Large dead tree trunk with a small number of limbs. The closest inspection cannot reveal that the tree in question is actually a magically concealed creature. To all normal tests you are, in fact, a tree or shrub, although a Spellcraft check can reveal a faint transmutation on the tree. While in tree form, you can observe all that transpires around you just as if you were in your normal form, and your hit points and defenses remain unaffected. You gain a \plus10 enhancement bonus to your armor modifier, but you have an effective Dexterity score of \minus10 and cannot move. You are immune to critical hits while in tree form. All clothing and gear carried or worn changes with you.

    An immobile, blazing curtain of shimmering violet fire springs into existence. Whenever a creature passes through the wall, you make a Reflex attack to deal damage to it. A failed attack deals half damage. In addition, the wall radiates heat, dealing 2d6 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d6 points of fire damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet. This damage does not require an attakc, and is dealt at the start of each of your turns after you create the wall.
    \par If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. If any 5-foot length of wall takes 20 points of cold damage or more in 1 round, that length goes out.

\spellattack{See text}
\begin{spelleffect}
    This spell forms a wall of stone atop existing rock surfaces. A wall of stone is 4 inches thick and composed of up to ten 5-foot squares. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
    \par You can create a wall of stone in almost any shape you desire. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell's area by half. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area.
    \par Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a \spell{disintegrate} spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 15 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 8. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 \add 2 per inch of thickness.

\begin{spelleffect}
    This spell creates a barrier of very tough, pliable, tangled brush bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a human's finger. Any creature forced into or attempting to move through a wall of thorns takes slashing damage per square of movement equal to twice your caster level, minus the creature's Armor defense.
    \par You can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall as twenty 10\mult10\mult5 foot blocks. This has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier.
    \par Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a grapple attack or Escape Artist check as a full-round action. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 20, up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land speed. Of course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as described above. A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage.
    \par If you have at least 5 feet of thorns between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of thorns between you, it provides total cover.
    \par Any creature in the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and is caught inside. In order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free, or it can wait until the spell ends. Creatures with the ability to pass throughs overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a wall of thorns at normal speed without taking damage.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    A \spell{wall of thorn} can be breached by slow work with edged weapons or fire. It has hardness 8 and 30 hit points per square foot of thickness.
    \par Despite its appearance, a \spell{wall of thorns} is not actually a living plant, and thus is unaffected by spells that affect plants.

    You cause wood to bend and warp, permanently destroying its straightness, form, and strength. A warped door springs open (or becomes stuck, requiring a Strength check to open, at your option). A boat or ship springs a leak. Warped ranged weapons are useless. A warped melee weapon imposes a \minus4 penalty on physical attacks.
    \par You may warp one Small or smaller object or its equivalent per caster level. A Medium object counts as two Small objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as sixteen, and a Colossal object as thirty-two.
    \par Alternatively, you can unwarp wood (effectively warping it back to normal) with this spell, straightening wood that has been warped by this spell or by other means. \spellindirect{make whole}{Make whole}, on the other hand, does no good in repairing a warped item.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}

\begin{spelleffect}
    You make a Reflex attack to entangle all creatures in the area. This attack is repeated each round that a creature moves or fights in the area. An entangled creature can spend a standard action to make a grapple attack or Escape Artist attempt against your Reflex attack to break the webs holding it, preventing it from being entangled. A creature entangled by the spell remains entangled until it breaks the webs holding it or escapes the spell's area.
    \par If the strands can be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed structures, such as walls, the strands are much more sturdy. A creature entangled within a sturdy web is unable to move from its square until it stops being entangled.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    An entangled creature moves at half speed, cannot sprint or charge, and takes a \minus2 penalty to physical attacks and defenses, as well as Strength and Dexterity-based checks. If it attempts to cast a spell must make a Concentration check (DC 10 \add double the spell's level) or lose the spell.
    The strands are too widely spaced to significantly obscure sight, but are flammable. A magic flaming sword can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire can set the webs alight and burn away 5 square feet in 1 round. All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames.

    This spell can be made permanent with a \spell{permanency} ritual. A permanent \spell{web} that is destroyed regrows in 10 minutes.

    This spell is the mightiest spell a wizard or sorcerer can cast. By simply speaking your desires aloud, you can alter reality to better suit you.
    \par Even wish, however, has its limits.
    \par A wish can produce any one of the following effects.
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Duplicate any general wizard or sorcerer spell of 8th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.
        \item Duplicate any general wizard or sorcerer spell of 7th level or lower even if it's of a prohibited school.
        \item Duplicate any other spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.
        \item Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower even if it's of a prohibited school. 
        \item Undo the harmful effects of many other spells, such as geas/quest or insanity.
        \item Create a nonmagical item of up to 10,000 gp in value.
        \item Create a magic item, or add to the powers of an existing magic item.
        \item Remove injuries and afflictions. A single wish can aid one creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction. For example, you could heal all the damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same wish. A wish can never restore the experience point loss from casting a spell or the level or Constitution loss from being raised from the dead.
        \item Revive the dead. A wish can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a resurrection spell. A wish can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two wishes, one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again.
        \item Transport travelers. A wish can lift one creature per caster level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. You must make a Will attack to affect unwilling targets.
        \item Undo misfortune. A wish can undo a single recent event. The wish forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish could undo a foe's successful critical hit (either the attack roll or the critical roll), a friend's failed attack, and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. You must make a Will attack to affect an unwilling target.
    \end{itemize*}
    \par When casting a wish, you do not specify the exact spell or effect you wish to duplicate. Instead, you make a wish, describing what you want to have happen, and make a DC 20 Wisdom check. If the check fails, your intent is redirected or perverted in some way. For example, a wish to turn a foe to stone would normally mimic the flesh to stone effect of the transmute flesh and stone spell. However, if the Wisdom check failed, your foe might gain the benefit of a \spell{stoneskin} spell instead.
    \par You may try to use a wish to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. The DC of the Wisdom check increases to 25, and the negative consequences for failing the check increase in proportion to the potency of the effect you try to create.

The actual point of arrival is a designated area no larger than 10 feet by 10 feet. You can be transported any distance within a plane but cannot travel between planes. You can transport, in addition to yourself, any objects you carry, as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. Exceeding this limit causes the spell to fail.

\begin{spelleffect}
    This spell functions as \spell{magic weapon}, except that the affected weapon also gains an additional five feet of reach, extending the wielder's threatened area. Attacks outside the weapon's normal range deal half damage, but are otherwise treated exactly as if the wielder was attacking with the weapon normally.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
    Despite the name of the spell, it can affect melee weapons of any type, even reach weapons. The weapon's extended reach is visible, and opponents can defend themselves normally against the attacks.
