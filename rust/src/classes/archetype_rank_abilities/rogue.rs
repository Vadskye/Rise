        [Magical]
        You learn two \textit{bardic performances} from the list below.
        You can also spend \glossterm{insight points} to learn one additional bardic performance per \glossterm{insight point}.
        You can use any bardic performance you know as a \glossterm{standard action} unless it specifies that it requires a different type of action to activate.

        All \textit{bardic performances} have the \abilitytag{Auditory} tag.
        When you use a \textit{bardic performance} ability, you begin a performance using one of your Perform skills.
        You must use either an instrumental performance or a vocal performance, and not a visual performance.
        If you use a vocal performance, the bardic performance gains the \abilitytag{Speech} tag, preventing it from affecting creatures that do not speak the language you perform in.
        You must be \glossterm{trained} with a Perform skill capable of making an auditory performance to use a bardic performance ability.
        If you are \glossterm{mastered} with an appropriate Perform skill, you gain a \plus2 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with the ability.

        The names of bardic performances do not have to precisely match your actual performance.
        For example, you can use the \textit{palliative poem} ability with a gentle song using Perform (wind instruments) or a distracting joke using Perform (comedy) instead of a poem.

        Many bardic performances require you to sustain the performance as a \glossterm{minor action}.
        If the targets stop being able to see or hear you, depending on the nature of your performance, the effect ends for them as if you had stopped sustaining the performance.
        However, targets do not stop being affected by your performance simply by travelling beyond the initial range of the bardic performance ability.
        Using a bardic performance ability with an immediate effect does not interfere with your ability to sustain other bardic performance abilities.
