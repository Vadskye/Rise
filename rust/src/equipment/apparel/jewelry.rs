            When you or an adjacent \glossterm<ally> casts a spell that does not have the \abilitytag<Attune> or \abilitytag<Sustain> tags,
                you can invest the magic of the spell in the ring.
            If you do, the spell does not have its normal effect.
            All decisions about the spell's effect, except for targeting, must be made at the time that the spell is invested in this way.
            The \textit<desperate exertion> ability cannot be used to affect the spell, either at the time it is invested or when it is activated.
            Only one spell can be stored this way.

            You can activate this ring as a standard action.
            When you do, you cause the effect of the last spell invested in the ring.
            You choose the area and targets affected by the spell at this time.
            This does not require \glossterm<verbal components> or \glossterm<somatic components>, even if they would normally be required to cast the spell.
            The spell's effect is determined based on the \glossterm<power> and other abilities of the original caster who invested the spell into the ring, not yours.
            You do not have to have the ability to cast the spell to activate a spell in this way.

            After you use a spell in this way, the energy in the ring is spent, and you must invest a new spell to activate the ring again.
            Any lingering effects of spells activated through this ring automatically end after ten minutes, and whenever you invest a new spell into the ring.
