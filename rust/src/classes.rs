                    Generally, such a creature must be at least 20th level, and must be a planeforged from a plane other than your own.
                    You must make a sacrifice, the details of which are subject to negotiation, and offer a part of your immortal soul.
                    In exchange, you gain the powers of a warlock.
                    The creature you make the pact with is called your soulkeeper.
                    Most warlocks make pacts with demons or devils, though other soulkeepers are possible.

                    Offering your soul to an entity in this way grants it the ability to communicate with you in limited ways.
                    This communication typically manifests as unnatural emotional urges or whispered voices audible only to you.
                    demon or devil.

                    Your pact specifies how much of your soul is granted to your soulkeeper, and the circumstances of the transfer.
                    The most common arrangement is for a soulkeeper to gain possession of your soul immediately after you die.
                    It will keep the soul for one decade per year of your life that you spend as a warlock.
                    During that time, it will not prevent you from being resurrected.
                    At the end of that time, if your soul remains intact, your soul will pass on to its intended afterlife.
                    However, other arrangements are possible, and each warlock's pact can be unique.

                    The longer you spend in an afterlife that is not your own, the more likely you are to lose your sense of self and become subsumed by the plane you are on.
                    Only a soul of extraordinary strength can maintain its integrity after decades or centuries in any plane.
                    Many warlocks seek power zealously while mortal to gain the mental fortitude necessary to keep their soul intact after death.

                    \cf{War}{Whispers of the Lost}[Magical]
                    You hear the voices of souls that inhabit your soulkeeper's plane, linked to you through your soulkeeper.

                    {
                        \subcf{Mentoring Whispers} You hear the voice of a dead warlock whose soul is bound to the same soulkeeper as yours.

                            It regains a semblance of life, allowing you to speak with it as if it were the creature the corpse belonged to.
                            The creature is able to refuse to speak with you, though you can attempt to persuade it to speak normally, and some creatures may be more willing to talk if they know they are already dead.

                            After this effect ends, the subject becomes immune to this effect until it takes a \glossterm{short rest}.

                            After you use this ability on a particular area of fire, you cannot use it again on that same area for 24 hours.

                        \parhead{Mastery} Once per round, when an \glossterm{ally} within a \areamed radius \glossterm{emanation} from you would lose \glossterm{hit points}, you may lose those hit points instead.
                        The target suffers any other effects of the attack normally, though it is not treated as if it lost hit points from the attack for the purpose of special attack effects.

                    \subsubsection{Knowledge}

                            Make a Knowledge check of any kind.
                            You and your \glossterm{allies} within a \arealarge radius learn the results of your check.
                            Creatures believe the information gained in this way to be true as if they it had seen it with their own eyes.

                            You cannot alter the knowledge you gain with this check in any way, such as by adding or withholding information.

                        \parhead{Aspect} When you roll a 1 on an \glossterm{attack roll}, it is treated as if you had rolled a 6.
                        \parhead{Essence} You can use the \textit{compel law} ability as a standard action.
                        \begin{durationability}{Compel Law}
                            \spelltwocol{Duration}{\abilitytag{Compulsion}}
                            \rankline
                            Make an attack vs. Mental against all creatures within a \arealarge radius from you.
                            \hit Each subject is unable to break the laws that apply in the area, and any attempt to do so simply fails.
                            The laws which are applied are those which are most appropriate for the area, regardless of whether you or any other creature know those laws.

                            % Sufficiently clear that this isn't part of the hit effect?
                            When you use this ability, you also gain the condition.
                            If this condition is removed from you, it is also removed from all other affected creatures.
                            In areas under ambiguous or nonexistent government, this ability may have unexpected effects, or it may have no effect at all.
                            \glance As above, except that the effect ends at the end of the next round.

                            \rankline
                            You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with the attack for each rank beyond 4.
                        \end{durationability}
                        % on average, slightly better than +1 accuracy
                        \parhead{Mastery} When you roll less than a 6 on an \glossterm{attack roll}, it is treated as if you had rolled a 6.

                        \parhead{Aspect} You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{vital rolls} (see \pcref{Vital Rolls}).
                        \parhead{Essence} At the end of each round, if you became \unconscious from a \glossterm{vital wound} that round, you can use one \glossterm{magical} ability you have that modifies \glossterm{vital rolls} or removes \glossterm{vital wounds} on yourself without taking an action.
                        \parhead{Mastery} You gain a \plus1 bonus to your base Constitution.

                    \subsubsection{Magic}
                        If you choose this domain, you add the \sphere{thaumaturgy} \glossterm{mystic sphere} to your list of divine mystic spheres (see \pcref{Mystic Spheres}).

                        \parhead{Gift} You gain a \plus4 bonus to the Spellsense skill (see \pcref{Spellsense}).

                        \parhead{Essence} You gain a \plus3 bonus to your \glossterm{magical} \glossterm{power}.
                        \parhead{Mastery} The power bonus from this domain's essence increases to \plus6.

                            Choose an \glossterm{ally} adjacent to you.
                            It gains a \plus2 bonus to all defenses until the end of the round.
                            Because this ability has the \abilitytag{Swift} tag, this bonus applies against attacks made in the current phase.

                            A creature that sees an attack against an ally protected in this way can observe that you are the cause of the protection with a \glossterm{difficulty rating} 5 Awareness check.
                            While this ability is active, you cannot gain a defense bonus from this ability, even if another creature with this ability uses it on you.
                        \end{durationability}
                        \parhead{Essence} The bonus from this domain's gift increases to twice your rank in this archetype.

                        \begin{attuneability}{Divine Strength}
                            \abilitytag{Attune} (self)
                            \rankline
                            You gain a \plus1 bonus to your base Strength.

                            You teleport up to 1 mile in any direction.
                            You do not need \glossterm{line of sight} or \glossterm{line of effect} to your destination, but you must be able to clearly visualize it.

                            \rankline
                            \rank{6} The maximum distance increases to 5 miles.
                        \end{instantability}
                        \parhead{Mastery} When you would move using one of your movement speeds, you can teleport the same distance instead.
                        This does not change the total distance you can move, but you can teleport in any direction, including vertically.
                        Being \grappled or otherwise physically constrained does not prevent you from teleporting in this way.

                        You can even attempt to move to locations outside of \glossterm{line of sight} and \glossterm{line of effect}, up to the limit of your remaining movement speed.
                        If your intended destination is invalid, the distance you tried to teleport is taken from your remaining movement, but you suffer no other ill effects.

                    \subsubsection{Trickery}
                        If you choose this domain, you add the Deception, Disguise, and Stealth skills to your cleric \glossterm{class skill} list.

                        \begin{durationability}{Compel Belief}

                            \rankline
                            Make an attack vs. Mental against a creature within \rngmed range.
                            You must also choose a belief that the target has.
                            The belief may be a lie that you told it, or even a simple misunderstanding (such as believing a hidden creature is not present in a room).
                            If the creature does not already hold the chosen belief, this ability automatically fails.
                            \hit The subject continues to maintain the chosen belief, regardless of any evidence to the contrary.
                            It will interpret any evidence that the falsehood is incorrect to be somehow wrong -- an illusion, a conspiracy to decieve it, or any other reason it can think of to continue believing the falsehood.
                            At the end of the effect, the creature can decide whether it believes the falsehood or not, as normal.
                            After this effect ends, the subject becomes immune to this effect until it takes a \glossterm{short rest}.
                            \glance As above, except that the effect ends at the end of the next round.

                            \rankline
                            You gain a \plus1 bonus to \glossterm{accuracy} with the attack for each rank beyond 4.

                        % This seems like it's a complicated muddle of weird and possibly hilarious edge cases
                        \parhead{Mastery} You are undetectable to all \glossterm{magical} abilities.
                        They cannot detect your presence, sounds you make, or any actions you take.
                        For example, a scrying sensor created by a \abilitytag{Scrying} effect would be unable to detect your presence, and a creature with magical \glossterm{darkvision} would not be able to see you without light.

                    \subsubsection{War}
                        \parhead{Gift} You gain proficiency with heavy armor and an additional \glossterm{weapon group} of your choice.
                        \parhead{Aspect} You gain a \plus2 bonus to your \glossterm{power} with all abilities.
                        \parhead{Essence} Whenever you miss by 2 or less with a \glossterm{strike}, the target takes half damage from the strike.
                        This is called a \glossterm{glancing blow}.
                        \parhead{Mastery} The bonus from this domain's aspect increases to \plus6.

                    \subsubsection{Water}
                        If you choose this domain, you add the \sphere{aquamancy} \glossterm{mystic sphere} to your list of divine mystic spheres (see \pcref{Mystic Spheres}).
                        In addition, you add the Flexibility and Swim skills to your cleric \glossterm{class skill} list.

                        \parhead{Gift} You gain a \plus2 bonus to the Flexibility and Swim skills.
                        \parhead{Aspect} You can breathe water as easily as a human breathes air, preventing you from drowning or suffocating underwater.
                        \parhead{Essence} You can use the \textit{speak with water} ability as a standard action.
                        \begin{attuneability}{Speak with Water}
                            \abilitytag{Attune} (self)
                            \rankline
                            You can speak with and command water within a \areahuge \glossterm{zone} from your location.
                            You can ask the water simple questions and understand its responses.
                            If you command the water to perform a task, it will do so do the best of its ability until this effect ends.
                            You cannot compel the water to move faster than 30 feet per round.

                            After you use this ability on a particular area of water, you cannot use it again on that same area for 24 hours.

                            \rankline
                            \rank{6} The area increases to a \areagarg radius.

                        \parhead{Mastery} Your body becomes partially aquatic, allowing you to manipulate it more easily.
                        The bonuses from this domain's gift increase to \plus10.

                        If you choose this domain, you add the \sphere{verdamancy} \glossterm{mystic sphere} to your list of divine mystic spheres (see \pcref{Mystic Spheres}).
                        In addition, you add the Creature Handling, Knowledge (nature), and Survival skills to your cleric \glossterm{class skill} list.

                        \parhead{Gift} You gain two skill points.
                        % TODO: clarify whether you can have this and the druid ability
                        \parhead{Aspect} This ability functions like the \textit{wild aspect} druid ability from the Shifter archetype (see \pcref{Shifter}), except that you cannot spend \glossterm{insight points} to learn additional wild aspects.
                        \parhead{Essence} You learn an additional \textit{wild aspect}.
                        \parhead{Mastery} You can maintain both of your wild aspects simultaneously.

                \subsection{Ex-Clerics}
                    If you grossly violate the code of conduct required by your deity, you lose all spells and magical cleric class abilities.
