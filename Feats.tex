\chapter{Feats}
Feats are special abilities that every character has. Feats can be used to specialize your character particular area, to grant your character new abilities, or to change the way your character does certain things.

\section{Gaining Feats}
Your character gains a feat every odd level: 1st, 3rd, 5th, and so on. Classes can sometimes grant bonus feats as well, which are in addition to these feats which every character gets.

\subsection{Bonus Feats}
Some class features and abilities grant a character bonus feats. Unless otherwise specified, the character must still meet any prerequisites for the feat. If the character does not meet the prerequisites at the time the bonus feat is granted, the character does not gain the feat. If the character later meets the prerequisites, the character immediately gains the benefit of the bonus feat.

If a character gains a feat as a bonus feat that he or she has already acquired through other means, the character may select instead any other feat for which she qualifies.

\section{Retraining Feats}
At every even level, your character can choose to retrain an old feat in exchange for a new feat. You can only retrain feats for other feats you could have acquired at the time you took the original feat. Thus, you cannot retrain feats gained through class features which give you a specific feat, since there were no other feats you could have taken. However, a 6th level fighter can retrain his 2nd level fighter bonus feat for any other combat feat that he qualified for at 2nd level.

\section{Prerequisites}
Some feats have prerequisites. Your character must have the indicated attribute score, class feature, feat, skill, base attack bonus, or other quality designated in order to select or use that feat. A character can gain a feat at the same level at which he or she gains the prerequisite.

A character can't use a feat if he or she has lost a prerequisite.

\section{Types Of Feats}
Some feats are general, meaning that no special rules govern
them as a group. Others belong to particular categories. The categories are given below:
\begin{itemize*}
\item Skill feats affect a character's mastery of his or her skills.
\item Combat feats affect a character's prowess in combat.
\item Combat maneuver feats are combat feats which grant a character particular talent with specific maneuvers.
\item Combat style feats grant a character the ability fight in particular styles. A character can only fight in one style at once.
\item Bloodline feats allow a character to tap into latent magical abilities in their blood.
\item Metamagic feats let spellcasters cast spells with greater effect, albeit as if the spells were a higher level than they actually are.
\item Item creation feats allow spellcasters to create magic items of various kinds.
\end{itemize*}

\subsection{Class Feats}
Class feats improve a character's class features.

\subsection{Racial feats}
Racial feats improve a character's racial abilities or grant new abilities unique to the character's race.

\subsection{Skill Feats}
Skill feats always affect a character's ability to use skills. Rogues can gain skill feats with their skill trick class feature.

\subsection{Combat Feats}
Combat feats always affect a character's combat abilities. Fighters gain bonus feats selected from a subset of the feat list presented in \tref{Combat Feats}. Any feat designated as a combat feat can be selected as a fighter's bonus feat.

\subsection{Combat Maneuver Feats}
Combat maneuver feats are combat feats which specifically deal with combat maneuvers -- pushing opponents around, grappling them, tripping them, or other unusual attacks. Any feat designated as a combat maneuver feat is also considered a combat feat and can be selected as a fighter's bonus feat.

\subsection{Combat Style Feats}
Combat style feats grant a character the ability to fight in a particular style, granting them bonuses while fighting in that style. A character can only fight in one style at once. Initiating a style or changing to a different style is a swift action, but a style can be stopped as a free action. Any feat designated as a combat maneuver feat is also considered a combat feat and can be selected as a fighter's bonus feat.

Some style feats have style requirements. To gain the benefits of a combat style with a style requirement, a character must take some action or fulfill some condition during his turn. If the condition is not met, the character automatically stops fighting in that style at the end of his turn. For example, a character using the Power Attack style must charge or full attack with a melee weapon each round. If the character takes the total defense action instead, he stops using the Power Attack style at the end of his turn.

\subsection{Bloodline Feats}

Some characters have traces of monstrous blood running in their veins. Most of those will never understand the full potential of their unusual heritage. Bloodline feats allow characters to explore those posibilities by gaining abilites related to their ancestry. Each bloodline feat belongs to a specific type of monster, such as ``dragon''. Some bloodline feats have stronger effects if you have more feats from that heritage.

\subsection{Metamagic Feats}
As a spellcaster's knowledge of magic grows, she can learn to cast spells in ways slightly different from the ways in which the spells were originally designed or learned. Preparing and casting a spell in such a way is harder than normal but, thanks to metamagic feats, at least it is possible. Spells modified by a metamagic feat use a spell slot higher than normal. All effects dependent on spell level (such as the ability to penetrate a \spell{lesser globe of invulnerability}) are calculated according to the spell's modified level.

\parhead{Applying Metamagic Feats} Spellcasters apply metamagic feats on the spot. Therefore, most spellcasters must also take more time to cast a metamagic spell (one enhanced by a metamagic feat) than they do to cast a regular spell. If the spell's normal casting time is a standard action, casting a metamagic version is a full-round action. (This isn't the same as a 1-round casting time.) For a spell with a longer casting time, it takes an extra full-round action to cast the spell. For a spell with a shorter casting time, it takes a standard action to cast the spell.

\par Sorcerers have such an intuitive grasp of magic that they do not need to take extra time to cast spells affected by metamagic feats.

\parhead{Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats} A cleric spontaneously casting a \spell{cure} or \spell{inflict} spell can cast a metamagic version of it instead.

\parhead{Effects of Metamagic Feats on a Spell} In all ways, a metamagic spell operates at its original spell level, even though it is prepared and cast as a higher-level spell.

The modifications made by these feats only apply to spells cast directly by the feat user. A spellcaster can't use a metamagic feat to alter a spell being cast from a wand, scroll, or other device.

Metamagic feats that eliminate components of a spell don't eliminate the attack of opportunity provoked by casting a spell while threatened. However, casting a spell modified by Quicken Spell does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

Metamagic feats cannot be used with all spells. See the specific feat descriptions for the spells that a particular feat can't modify.

\parhead{Multiple Metamagic Feats on a Spell} A spellcaster can apply multiple metamagic feats to a single spell. Changes to its level are cumulative. You can't apply the same metamagic feat more than once to a single spell.

\parhead{Magic Items and Metamagic Spells} With the right item creation feat, you can store a metamagic version of a spell in a scroll, potion, or wand. Level limits for potions and wands apply to the spell's higher spell level (after the application of the metamagic feat). A character doesn't need the metamagic feat to activate an item storing a metamagic version of a spell.

\parhead{Counterspelling Metamagic Spells} Whether or not a spell has been enhanced by a metamagic feat does not affect its vulnerability to counterspelling or its ability to counterspell another spell.

\subsection{Item Creation Feats}
An item creation feat lets a spellcaster create a magic item of a certain type. Regardless of the type of items they involve, the various item creation feats all have certain features in common.

\parhead{Raw Materials Cost} The cost of creating a magic item equals one-half the sale cost of the item.

Using an item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or magical workshop, special tools, and so on. A character generally has access to what he or she needs unless unusual circumstances apply.

\parhead{Negative Levels} Power and energy that a spellcaster would normally have is expended when making a magic item. While crafting a magic item, a spellcaster gains a negative level that cannot be removed. After the magic item is complete, the spellcaster still suffers the negative level for two days per day required to make the item. Scrolls and potions are less draining, and only bestow negative levels for one day per day required to make the item. These negative levels cannot be removed by any means.

\parhead{Time} The time to create a magic item depends on the feat and the cost of the item. The minimum time is one day.

\parhead{Item Cost} Brew Potion, Craft Wand, and Scribe Scroll create items that directly reproduce spell effects, and the power of these items depends on their caster level -- that is, a spell from such an item has the power it would have if cast by a spellcaster of that level. The price of these items (and thus the cost of the raw materials) also depends on the caster level. The caster level must be high enough that the spellcaster creating the item can cast the spell at that level. To find the final price in each case, multiply the caster level by the spell level, then multiply the result by a constant, as shown below:

\subparhead{Scrolls} Base price = spell level \mtimes caster level \mtimes 25 gp.
\subparhead{Potions} Base price = spell level \mtimes  caster level \mtimes 50 gp.
\subparhead{Wands} Base price = spell level \mtimes  caster level \mtimes 750 gp.

\par A 0-level spell is considered to have a spell level of 1/2 for the
purpose of this calculation. The minimum caster level to craft an item is always 2, regardless of the level of the spell used.

\parhead{Extra Costs} Any potion, scroll, or wand that stores a spell with a costly material component also carries a commensurate cost. For potions and scrolls, the creator must expend the material component when creating the item. For a wand, the creator must expend fifty copies of the material component.

\par Some magic items similarly incur extra costs in material components, as noted in their descriptions.

\section{Feat Descriptions}
Here is the format for feat descriptions.

\ssecfake{Feat Name [Type of Feat]}

\par Several modifiers may apply to the Survival check, as given on the table below.

\begin{dtable}
\begin{tabularx}{\columnwidth}{>{\lcol}X >{\rcol}p{6em}}

\end{tabularx}
1 For a group of mixed sizes, apply only the modifier for the largest size category. \\
2 Apply only the largest modifier from this category.
\end{dtable}

\begin{comment}

\end{comment}

\subsubsection{Empower Spell [Metamagic]}
\parhead{Prerequisite} Caster level 4th.
\parhead{Benefit} When casting a heightened spell, you gain a \plus2 circumstance bonus to caster level. A heightened spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level. Unlike other metamagic feats, you can apply this metamagic feat any number of times, increasing your caster level by 2 each time.

\subsubsection{Energetic Substitution [Metamagic]}
\parhead{Prerequisite} Caster level 4th.
\parhead{Benefit} When casting a substituted spell, you can choose what kind of energy damage it deals: cold, fire, or electricity. This can only be applied to spells that originally dealt cold, fire, or electricity damage. A substituted spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.

\subsubsection{Imbued Spellstrike [Metamagic]}
\parhead{Prerequisite} Caster level 4th.
\parhead{Benefit} As part of casting an imbued spellstrike spell, you can make a single attack with a weapon in your hand. If the attack hits, the struck creature is affected by the spell, as if it had been the target, in addition to taking damage from the weapon. The imbuement fades away without effect after 1 round (at the end of your next turn) if you have not struck a foe.

Only spells which affect a single target can be channeled in this way. An imbued spellstrike uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.

\subsubsection{Improved Imbued Spellstrike [Metamagic]}
\parhead{Prerequisite} Caster level 6th, Imbued Strike.
\parhead{Benefit} This metamagic functions like Imbued Strike, except that the imbuement lasts for 5 minutes if you have not struck a foe. If the weapon leaves your hands or if you cast another spell, the imbuement fades away without effect.

An improved imbued spellstrike uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.

\subsubsection{Quicken Spell [Metamagic]}
\parhead{Prerequisite} Caster level 6th.
\parhead{Benefit} Casting a quickened spell is a swift action. You can perform another action, even casting another spell, in the same round as you cast a quickened spell. However, casting a quickened spell is mentally exhausting. In the turn after you cast it, you lose your standard action. You may cast only one quickened spell per round. A spell whose casting time is more than 1 standard action cannot be quickened. A quickened spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level. Casting a quickened spell doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.
\parhead{Special} All spellcasters cast a quickened spell as a swift action, even if they would normally increase the casting time of spells with metamagic applied. This is an exception to the general rule that applying metamagic increases the casting time of a spell.

\subsubsection{Reach Spell [Metamatic]}
\parhead{Prerequisite} Caster level 6th.
\parhead{Benefit} When casting a reach spell, you can use a spell with a range of touch on a target within \rngclose range. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack. A reach spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.

\subsubsection{Shape Spell [Metamagic]}
\parhead{Prerequisite} Caster level 6th.
\parhead{Benefit} When casting a shaped spell, you can exclude any number of 5-foot cubes within the spell's area. This allows you to prevent the spell from affecting your allies, while still allowing it to affect your enemies. The area affected by the spell must be contiguous.

Only area spells can be shaped. A shaped spell uses a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's original level.

\subsubsection{Silent Spell [Metamagic]}
\parhead{Prerequisite} Caster level 4th.

\subsubsection{Sustained Spell [Metamagic]}
\featpre Caster level 4th.
\featben You can maintain concentration on a sustained spell as a swift action instead of as a standard action. If you cast any other spell, you lose the ability to sustain the spell. This only affects spell duration, and has no effect on spells with special effects based on concentration, such as \spell{call lightning}. A sustained spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.

\subsubsection{Widen Spell [Metamagic]}
\parhead{Prerequisite} Caster level 8th.
\parhead{Benefit} You can alter a burst, emanation, line, or spread shaped spell to increase its area. Any numeric measurements of the spell's area increase by 100\%. A widened spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell's actual level.
\par Spells that do not have an area of one of these four sorts are not affected by this feat.

\subsection{Item Creation Feats}

\subsubsection{Imbue Magic [Item Creation]}
\parhead{Prerequisite} Caster level 2nd or Craft (any) 6 ranks.
\parhead{Benefit} You can imbue items with magic using your spells or crafting ability. Imbuing an item with magic takes time and material components, as described in \pcref{Magic Item Creation}.

You can also mend a broken magic item if it is one that you could make. Doing so costs a tenth of the raw materials and a quarter of the time it would take to craft that item in the first place. You cannot mend a destroyed magic item.

\subsubsection{Imbuement Admixture [Item Creation]}

\parhead{Benefit} You can blend two spells together to create magic items.
