\end{spelltrigger}
\spellnotes A \spell{silence} spell or similar effect can prevent an audible alarm from being heard. This ritual can be made permanent with a \spell{permanency} ritual.

\spelltime{1 minute}
\spellrng{Touch}
\begin{spelltarget}{One or more corpses}
    \spellspecial The combined levels of all targets cannot exceed your spellpower.
    \spelleffect The target becomes an undead creature that obeys your spoken commands. You choose whether to create a skeleton or a zombie. Creating a zombie require a mostly intact corpse, including most of the flesh. Creating a skeleton only requires a mostly intact skeleton. If a skeleton is made from an intact corpse, the flesh quickly falls off the animated bones.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this ritual, however, you can control only 4 levels worth of undead creatures per spellpower. If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control, and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled. You choose which creatures are released.

Once destroyed, an undead creature never be animated again, even if the corpse is intact.

\spelldur One week
\begin{spelltarget}{One Tiny animal}
    \spelleffect As soon as you begin performing this ritual, the target animal approaches you and awaits your bidding. You can mentally impress on the animal a certain place well known to you or an obvious landmark. The directions must be simple, because the animal depends on your knowledge and can't find a destination on its own. During the casting of the ritual, you can attach some small item or note to the messenger. The animal then goes to the designated location and waits there, straying only to gather food and water as necessary, until the duration of the ritual expires. During this period of waiting, the messenger allows others to approach it and remove any scroll or token it carries.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes The most common use for this ritual is to get an animal to carry a message to your allies. The animal cannot be one tamed or trained by someone else.

\begin{spelltarget}{One closable object, such as a door or box (Large or smaller)}
    \spelleffect The target object is magically locked. It can be unlocked with a Devices check against a DC equal to 30 \add your spellpower. The DC to break it open forcibly increases by 10.

    You can freely pass your own \ritual{arcane lock}, as if the object were not locked.

\begin{spellsection}{Atonement}{5}
\spellinfo{Evocation (Channeling)}{Divine, Nature}
\spelltime{1 hour}
\spellrng{Touch}
\begin{spelltarget}{One creature}
    \spelleffect If the target has been punished for a significant transgression against its alignment, deity, or organization, this ritual can undo that punishment. The exact effects of this atonement depend on the nature of the punishment the creature is suffering.

    The cost of the ritual depends on the circumstances of the act that provoked the punishment. If the creature's act was unintentional, or under magical influence, no material components are required. If the creature's act was intentional, but the creature seeks atonement intentionally, the normal cost must be paid. If the creature's act was intentional, and the creature does not seek atonement willingly, the material component cost is doubled.

\begin{spellsection}{Augury}{2}
\spellinfo{Divination (Knowledge)}{Divine}
\spelltime{1 minute}
\spellsr{No}
\spellspecial When you perform this ritual, you state an action that a creature (or group of creatures) could take.
\spelleffect You learn whether a particular action is likely to bring good or bad results for you in the immediate future. The ritual provides one of four results:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Weal (if the action will probably bring good results).
    \item Woe (for bad results).
    \item Weal and woe (for both).
    \item No response (for actions that don't have especially good or bad results).
\end{itemize}

This ritual does not describe the future with certainty. It describes which result is most probable. The more unambiguous the action's effects, the more likely the ritual is to be correct.
\spellnotes This ritual can only foresee events roughly half an hour into the future. Thus, the result might not take into account the long-term consequences of an action.

\spelltwocol{\spellzone{\areasmall radius}}{\spellrng{\rngclose}}
\spelldur 24 hours
\spellspecial When you perform this ritual, you may cast \spell{dimensional anchor}.
\spellline
\spelleffect This ritual inscribes a magic circle of ritual components on the ground, denoting the edges of the area. If the circle is broken, the ritual's effects end immediately.
\begin{spelltrigger}{A creature other than you enters the area}
    \begin{spelltarget}{The entering creature}[Magic vs. Will]
        \spellsuccess The target is unable to escape the area physically, alter the circle in any way, or use abilities that have effects which extend outside the area. If it uses any spells or abilities, the effects stop at the edge of the area, as if the edge of the area was an impassable barrier.

        If you cast \spell{dimensional anchor} while performing the ritual, the target is also affected by \spell{dimensional anchor}, preventing it from escaping the area magically.
        \spellfailure The target can leave the area, break the circle, and otherwise act normally.
    \end{spelltarget}
\end{spelltrigger}

\spellnotes You can perform this ritual on an existing \spell{binding} to set its remaining duration to 24 hours, rather than to create a new \spell{binding}. You must make a new attack against all creatures in the area each time you reset the duration in this way.

The magic circle is obvious, but a DC 16 Spellcraft check is required to identify that the circle belongs to a \spell{binding} ritual. Alternately, the magic of the trap can be identified with a DC 28 Perception check.

\begin{spelltarget}{One creature or object}[Spellpower vs. Special]
    \spelleffect Magical effects on the target are dispelled, as a targeted \spell{dispel magic}. This ritual can also remove effects that are immune to \spell{dispel magic}, such as curses, if they are 6th level or lower.
\end{spelltarget}
\par If the effect comes from some permanent magic item, \ritual{break enchantment} does not remove the curse from the item, but it does frees the victim from the item's effects.

It can be used in place of the creature's original body for the purpose of spells and effects which animate or resurrect the dead, such as \spell{animate dead} or \spell{resurrection} (see \pcref{Bringing Back the Dead}).
\ritualcost{7}[in ritual components, and a piece of flesh (not hair, nails, scales, or the like) with a volume of at least 1 cubic inch that was taken from the original creature's living body. The piece of flesh need not be fresh, but it must be kept from rotting.]

\spelleffect You contact your deity -- or agents thereof -- and ask questions that can be answered by a simple yes or no. You are allowed one such question per caster level. The answers given are correct within the limits of the entity's knowledge. ``Unclear'' is a legitimate answer, because powerful beings of the Outer Planes are not necessarily omniscient. In cases where a one-word answer would be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, a short phrase (five words or less) may be given as an answer instead.

\spelleffect You instantly gain knowledge of as many as three facts from among the following subjects: the ground or terrain, plants, minerals, bodies of water, people, general animal population, presence of woodland creatures, presence of powerful unnatural creatures, or even the general state of the natural setting.
\par In outdoor settings, the ritual operates in a 10 mile radius. In natural underground settings -- caves, caverns, and the like -- the radius is limited to 1,000 feet.

\begin{spelltarget}{You}
    \spelleffect You gain the ability to understand any language. This does not grant you any additional ability to speak or write in other languages.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes This ritual can be foiled by certain obscuring magic (such as the \spell{secret page} and \spell{illusory script} rituals). It does not decipher codes or reveal messages concealed in otherwise normal text. You may be unable to understand dead or extremely obscure languages.

This ritual can be made permanent with a \spell{permanency} ritual.

\spelldur \durmed or until expended
\spelleffect You send your mind to another plane of existence (an Elemental Plane or some plane farther removed) in order to receive advice and information from powers there. You are allowed one such question per caster level. The answers given are correct within the limits of the entity's knowledge. ``Unclear" is a legitimate answer, because even powerful beings of other planes are not necessarily omniscient. In cases where a one-word answer would be misleading or contrary to the entity's interests, a short phrase (five words or less) may be given as an answer instead.

\spelleffect This ritual changes the weather in the area. The weather begins to form as you perform the ritual. You can call forth weather appropriate to the climate and season of the area you are in. For example, you can normally create a thunderstorm, but not if the season is winter or you are in a desert.
\par You control the general tendencies of the weather, such as the direction and intensity of the wind. You cannot control specific applications of the weather -- where lightning strikes, for example, or the exact path of a tornado.Contradictory conditions are not possible simultaneously.

The food that this ritual creates is simple fare of your choice -- highly nourishing, if rather bland. You can create food suitable to sustain any kind of creature, if you know what it eats.

Food created by this ritual decays and becomes inedible within 24 hours. The water created by this ritual is just like clean rain water, and does not go bad as the food does.

    If the target is charged to perform a task, it is still able to eat, sleep, and otherwise function normally without performing the task at all times. In general, it should spend at least 12 hours a day performing the task. However, it cannot use its free time to work against the completion of the task.

    \par If the target is prevented from obeying the command for 24 hours, it takes a \minus2 penalty to all attributes. Each day, another \minus2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of \minus8. No attribute can be reduced to less than \minus9 by this effect. All attribute penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the command.

\par You can create any floor plan you desire to the limit of the spell's effect. The place is furnished and contains sufficient foodstuffs to serve a nine-course banquet to a dozen people per caster level.

\spellspecial When you perform this ritual, you may specify a triggering condition. The condition must be something that a typical human could detect.
\spellline
\spelleffect This ritual creates an ethereal passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not other materials. One phase door offering entrance to the passage appears at each end of the area. The entrances are invisible and inaccessible to all creatures except you, and any creatures who meet the triggering condition.

The passage can be used a number of times equal to half your caster level before the ritual is expended. A creature using the phase door enters the Ethereal Plane when it enters the passage, and reappears on the Matereal Plane when it leaves the passage. Creatures inside the passage cannot leave the boundaries of the passage on the Ethereal Plane. The door does not allow light, sound, or spell effects through it, nor can you see through it without using it.

\spellnotes A \spell{true seeing} spell or similar magic reveals the presence of a phase door but does not allow its use. If either end of the passage is dispelled, the passage is destroyed, and anyone within the passage is harmlessly ejected from the closest exit. This ritual can be made permanent with a \spell{permanency} ritual.

If you are not on the Material Plane when you perform this ritual, it has no effect.

    \spelleffect The target returns to life in a new body. It must have been dead for no more than one year, and it must not have died due to old age.

    The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature's body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the target portion must have been part of the creature's body at the time of death.

    This ritual creates an entirely new body for the creature's soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. During the ritual, the body ages to match the age of the original creature at the time it died. The reincarnated creature has 0 hit points, and all negative effects are removed, even curses and missing body parts.

    A reincarnated creature is identical to the original creature in all respects, except for its race. It loses all the attribute modifiers and special abilities from its old race. It gains the attribute modifiers and special abilities of its new race. However, its racial bonus feat and languages are unchanged.

    If the target is a humanoid creature, its new race should be determined with \tref{Humanoid Reincarnations}. If not, a similar table for creatures of the same type should be used.

    Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. All of the target's spell slots and other daily abilities are expended until it rests. In addition, the target gains a negative level. If the subject was 1st level when it died, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead. This negative level or Constitution drain lasts as long as the creature remains in its new body. This penalty can be removed by returning to the creature's proper body, as with \spell{resurrection}, or with the Racial Acclimation feat (page \featpref{Racial Acclimation}).

    \spelleffect The target gains the semblance of life and intellect, allowing it to answer several questions that you put to it. You may ask one question per two caster levels. Unasked questions are wasted if the duration expires.

    The corpse's knowledge is limited to what the creature knew during life, including the languages it spoke (if any). A perfectly fresh, intact corpse knows almost as much as the creature did, though it speaks cryptically. The more damaged or decayed the corpse is, the more brief, repetitive, or vague its answers are. In general, a corpse's answers become useless after a week of decay. If the corpse's mouth is destroyed (or if it has no mouth), it cannot speak at all.
\end{spelltarget}

\spellnotes This ritual has no effect if the target has been subject to \spell{speak with dead} within the past week, or has been turned into an undead creature.

\par This spell does not let you actually speak to the person (whose soul has departed). It instead draws on the imprinted knowledge stored in the corpse. The corpse is unable to learn new information, or even remember any previous questions asked of it.

You may target creatures larger than Medium size. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth.

\spelleffect When you perform this ritual, you specify a destination up to 100 miles away on your current plane, and make an Intelligence check. The DC of the check depends on your familiarity with the destination, as shown on \tref{Teleport DCs}.

Success means the targets teleport to the intended destination. Failure means the targets arrive a random distance away from the intended destination in a random direction. The distance off target is equal to 1d10\mult1d10\% of the distance that they would have traveled to the intended destination. Failure by 10 or more means the targets arrive in a completely different area within range that is visually or thematically similar to the intended destination. If no such area exists within the spell's range, the ritual simply fails instead.

After teleporting, the targets must skip their next actions.

The servant can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity over and over again if told to do so. It can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, and the like. It has an effective Strength score of \minus8 (so it can lift 20 pounds or drag 100 pounds). It can trigger traps and similar devices, but it can exert only 20 pounds of force, which is not enough to activate certain pressure plates and other devices. It can't perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a check using a skill that can't be used untrained. It hovers just off the ground, and moves at a speed of 15 feet.
