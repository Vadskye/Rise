\end{spelltrigger}
\spellnotes A \spell{silence} spell or similar effect can prevent an audible alarm from being heard. This ritual can be made permanent with a \spell{permanency} ritual.

\spellrng{Touch}
\spelldur{One year \dismissable}
\begin{spelltarget}{One magical object (Large or smaller)}[Magic vs. Will]
    \spellsuccess This ritual alters one of the target's magic auras (see \pcref{Spellcraft}). You can decrease the caster level of the aura by up to half your caster level. Alternately, you can increase the caster level of the aura, up to a maximum of your caster level.

    In addition, you can change the school, subschool, and descriptors of the aura.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes If the target is examined with \spell{identify} or a similar effect, the true aura is revealed.

\par This ritual has no effects on artifacts.

\spelldur{\durlong}
\spellsr{Yes}
\begin{spelltarget}{You}
    \spelleffect When you perform this ritual, you make a Disguise check to disguise yourself. You gain a \plus10 enhancement bonus on the check, and you take no penalties for emulating a different gender or race.

\spellsection{Animate Dead}{3}
\spelldesc{You bind a fragment of a dead creature's soul to its corpse, reanimating it as an undead skeleton or zombie.}
\spellinfo{Necromancy (Soul, Vitalism) [Evil, Negative]}{Arcane, Divine}
\spelltime{1 minute}
\spellrng{Touch}
\begin{spelltarget}{One or more corpses}
    \spellspecial The combined levels of all targets cannot exceed your caster level.
    \spelleffect The target becomes an undead creature that obeys your spoken commands. You choose whether to create a skeleton or a zombie. Creating a zombie require a mostly intact corpse, including most of the flesh. Creating a skeleton only requires a mostly intact skeleton. If a skeleton is made from an intact corpse, the flesh quickly falls off the animated bones.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this ritual, however, you can control only 4 levels worth of undead creatures per caster level. If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control, and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled. You choose which creatures are released.

Once destroyed, an undead creature never be animated again, even if the corpse is intact.

\spellsection{Animal Messenger}{2}

\spelltime{1 minute; see text}
\spellrng{\rnglong}
\spelldur{One week}
\spellsr{Yes}
\begin{spelltarget}{One Tiny animal}
    \spelleffect As soon as you begin performing this ritual, the target animal approaches you and awaits your bidding. You can mentally impress on the animal a certain place well known to you or an obvious landmark. The directions must be simple, because the animal depends on your knowledge and can't find a destination on its own. During the casting of the ritual, you can attach some small item or note to the messenger. The animal then goes to the designated location and waits there, straying only to gather food and water as necessary, until the duration of the ritual expires. During this period of waiting, the messenger allows others to approach it and remove any scroll or token it carries.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes The most common use for this ritual is to get an animal to carry a message to your allies. The animal cannot be one tamed or trained by someone else.
\spellfocus{Food desirable to the animal}

\spelltime{1 minute}
\spellrng{\rngmed}
\spelldur{\durlong \dismissable}
\spellline
\spelleffect This ritual creates a magic sensor. As a standard action, you can concentrate to see through the sensor as if you were in its location. While concentrating, you can move the sensor up to 30 feet per round in any direction.

You can freely control and see through the sensor even if it moves beyond the spell's range, or out of your line of effect.

\spellsection{Arcane Lock}{2}
\spellinfo{Abjuration/Transmutation (Alteration, Warding)}{Arcane}
\spelltime{1 minute}
\spellrng{Touch}
\spelldur{Permanent}
\begin{spelltarget}{One closable object, such as a door or box (Large or smaller)}
    \spelleffect The target object is magically locked. It can be unlocked with a Devices check against a DC equal to 30 \add your caster level. The DC to break it open forcibly increases by 10.

    You can freely pass your own \ritual{arcane lock}, as if the object were not locked.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes A \ritual{knock} spell suppresses the effect for 10 minutes, but does not dispel the \spell{arcane lock}.
\ritualcost*{2}

\spellsection{Arcane Mark}{1}
\spelldesc{You inscribe your personal sigil on a creature or object.}
\spellinfo{Universal}{Arcane}
\spelltime{1 minute}
\spellrng{\rngtouch}
\spelldur{Permanent}
\spellspecial When you learn this ritual, choose a personal rune or mark. It can consist of no more than six characters, and must fit within one square foot.
\begin{spelltarget}{One creature or object}
    \spelleffect Your personal rune or mark is written on the target. The target is not harmed by the writing. You can choose whether the writing will be visible or invisible.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes If an \spell{arcane mark} is placed on a creature, normal wear gradually causes the effect to fade in about a month. You must place your mark on an object before \spell{instant summons} can be cast on it.
\ritualcost*{1}

\spellsection{Atonement}{5}
\spellinfo{Evocation (Channeling)}{Divine, Nature}
\spelltime{1 hour}
\spellrng{Touch}
\spellsr{Yes}
\begin{spelltarget}{One creature}
    \spelleffect If the target has been punished for a significant transgression against its alignment, deity, or organization, this ritual can undo that punishment. The exact effects of this atonement depend on the nature of the punishment the creature is suffering.

    The cost of the ritual depends on the circumstances of the act that provoked the punishment. If the creature's act was unintentional, or under magical influence, no material components are required. If the creature's act was intentional, but the creature seeks atonement intentionally, the normal cost must be paid. If the creature's act was intentional, and the creature does not seek atonement willingly, the material component cost is doubled.
\end{spelltarget}
\ritualcost{5}

\spellsection{Augury}{2}
\spellinfo{Divination (Knowledge)}{Divine}
\spelltime{1 minute}
\spellspecial When you perform this ritual, you state an action that a creature (or group of creatures) could take.
\spelleffect You learn whether a particular action is likely to bring good or bad results for you in the immediate future. The ritual provides one of four results:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Weal (if the action will probably bring good results).
    \item Woe (for bad results).
    \item Weal and woe (for both).
    \item No response (for actions that don't have especially good or bad results).
\end{itemize}

This ritual does not describe the future with certainty. It describes which result is most probable. The more unambiguous the action's effects, the more likely the ritual is to be correct.
\spellnotes This ritual can only foresee events roughly half an hour into the future. Thus, the result might not take into account the long-term consequences of an action.
\ritualcost*{2}

\spellsection{Awaken}{7}
\spellinfo{Transmutation (Augment, Imbuement)}{Nature}
\spelltime{24 hours}
\spellrng{Touch}
\spellsr{Yes}
\begin{spelltarget}{One animal}
    \spelleffect The target becomes sentient. Its Intelligence becomes 1d6-3. Its type changes from animal to magical beast. It gains the ability to speak and understand one language that you know.
\end{spelltarget}

\spellsection{Binding}{3}
\spelldesc{You create an invisible cage designed to hold a creature inside.}
\spellinfo{Abjuration (Negation)}{Arcane, Divine}
\spelltime{1 hour}
\spelltwocol{\spellzone{\areasmall radius}}{\spellrng{\rngclose}}
\spelldur{24 hours}
\spellsr{Yes}
\spellspecial When you perform this ritual, you may cast \spell{dimensional anchor}.
\spellline
\spelleffect This ritual inscribes a magic circle of ritual components on the ground, denoting the edges of the area. If the circle is broken, the ritual's effects end immediately.
\begin{spelltrigger}{A creature other than you enters the area}
    \begin{spelltarget}{The entering creature}[Magic vs. Will]
        \spellsuccess The target is unable to escape the area physically, alter the circle in any way, or use abilities that have effects which extend outside the area. If it uses any spells or abilities, the effects stop at the edge of the area, as if the edge of the area was an impassable barrier.

        If you cast \spell{dimensional anchor} while performing the ritual, the target is also affected by \spell{dimensional anchor}, preventing it from escaping the area magically.
        \spellfailure The target can leave the area, break the circle, and otherwise act normally.
    \end{spelltarget}
\end{spelltrigger}

\spellnotes You can perform this ritual on an existing \spell{binding} to set its remaining duration to 24 hours, rather than to create a new \spell{binding}. You must make a new attack against all creatures in the area each time you reset the duration in this way.

The magic circle is obvious, but a DC 16 Spellcraft check is required to identify that the circle belongs to a \spell{binding} ritual. Alternately, the magic of the trap can be identified with a DC 28 Perception check.

\spellsection{Bless Water}{1}
\spelldesc{You imbue water with holy power.}

\spellinfo{Abjuration (Negation) [Magic]}{Arcane, Divine}
\spelltime{1 minute}
\spellrng{\rngclose}
\begin{spelltarget}{One creature or object}[Caster level vs. Special]
    \spelleffect Magical effects on the target are dispelled, as a targeted \spell{dispel magic}. This ritual can also remove effects that are immune to \spell{dispel magic}, such as curses, if they are 6th level or lower.
\end{spelltarget}
\par If the effect comes from some permanent magic item, \ritual{break enchantment} does not remove the curse from the item, but it does frees the victim from the item's effects.
\ritualcost{5}

\spellinfo{Divination (Scrying)}{Arcane, Divine}
\spelltime{1 minute}
\spellrng{\rngext \rngunrestricted}
\spelldur{\durmed \dismissable}
\spellline
\spelleffect This ritual creates a magic sensor. You don't need line of sight or line of effect to create the sensor, but the destination must be known -- a place familiar to you or an obvious one. As a standard action, you can concentrate to see and hear through the sensor as if you were in its location. While concentrating, you can rotate the sensor to see and hear in any direction.
\spellnotes \sensorspellnotes
\ritualcost*{3}

\spellsection{Clone}{7}
\spellinfo{Conjuration (Creation)}{Arcane}
\spelltime{24 hours}
\spellrng{Touch}
\spelleffect This ritual creates an inert duplicate of a creature. The duplicate body is identical to the creature's original body, but it has no soul, and rots if not preserved. It can be used in place of the creature's original body for the purpose of spells and effects which animate or raise the dead, such as \spell{animate dead} or \spell{raise dead} (see \pcref{Bringing Back the Dead}).
\ritualcost{7}[in ritual components, and a piece of flesh (not hair, nails, scales, or the like) with a volume of at least 1 cubic inch that was taken from the original creature's living body. The piece of flesh need not be fresh, but it must be kept from rotting.]

\spellsection{Commune}{5}
\spellinfo{Divination (Communication) [Planar]}{Divine}
\spelltime{10 minutes}
\spelldur{\durmed or until expended}
\spellline
\spelleffect You contact your deity -- or agents thereof -- and ask questions that can be answered by a simple yes or no. You are allowed one such question per caster level. The answers given are correct within the limits of the entity's knowledge. ``Unclear'' is a legitimate answer, because powerful beings of the Outer Planes are not necessarily omniscient. In cases where a one-word answer would be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, a short phrase (five words or less) may be given as an answer instead.
\spellnotes A cleric without a deity contacts a philosophically aligned deity.
\ritualcost*{5}

\spellsection{Commune with Nature}{5}
\spelldesc{You become one with nature, attaining knowledge of the surrounding territory.}
\spellinfo{Divination (Knowledge)}{Nature}
\spelltime{10 minutes}
\spellrng{10 miles or 1,000 feet; see text}
\spellline
\spelleffect You instantly gain knowledge of as many as three facts from among the following subjects: the ground or terrain, plants, minerals, bodies of water, people, general animal population, presence of woodland creatures, presence of powerful unnatural creatures, or even the general state of the natural setting.
\par In outdoor settings, the ritual operates in a 10 mile radius. In natural underground settings -- caves, caverns, and the like -- the radius is limited to 1,000 feet.
\spellnotes The ritual does not function where nature has been replaced by construction or settlement, such as in dungeons and towns.
\ritualcost*{5}

\spellsection{Comprehend Languages}{2}
\spelldesc{You can understand any language.}
\spellinfo{Divination (Communication)}{Arcane, Divine, Nature}
\spelltime{1 minute}
\spelldur{\durlong}
\begin{spelltarget}{You}
    \spelleffect You gain the ability to understand any language. This does not grant you any additional ability to speak or write in other languages.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes This ritual can be foiled by certain obscuring magic (such as the \spell{secret page} and \spell{illusory script} rituals). It does not decipher codes or reveal messages concealed in otherwise normal text. You may be unable to understand dead or extremely obscure languages.

This ritual can be made permanent with a \spell{permanency} ritual.

\spelltime{10 minutes}
\spelldur{\durmed or until expended}
\spelleffect You send your mind to another plane of existence (an Elemental Plane or some plane farther removed) in order to receive advice and information from powers there. You are allowed one such question per caster level. The answers given are correct within the limits of the entity's knowledge. ``Unclear" is a legitimate answer, because even powerful beings of other planes are not necessarily omniscient. In cases where a one-word answer would be misleading or contrary to the entity's interests, a short phrase (five words or less) may be given as an answer instead.

\spellsection{Contagion}{3}

\spellsr{Yes}
\begin{spelltarget}{One creature}[Magic vs. Fortitude]
    \spellsuccess The target contracts a disease selected from the table below, which strikes immediately (no incubation period). The disease's attack bonus for the initial and subsequent incubation periods is equal to your magic attack bonus.

\spelltime{1 minute}
\spellrng{Touch}
\spelldur{Permanent}
\begin{spelltarget}{One object}
    \spelleffect The target glows like a torch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn't use oxygen. A \spell{continual flame} can be covered and hidden, but not smothered or quenched.

\spelldur{\durext}
\spelleffect This ritual changes the weather in the area. The weather begins to form as you perform the ritual. You can call forth weather appropriate to the climate and season of the area you are in. For example, you can normally create a thunderstorm, but not if the season is winter or you are in a desert.
\par You control the general tendencies of the weather, such as the direction and intensity of the wind. You cannot control specific applications of the weather -- where lightning strikes, for example, or the exact path of a tornado.Contradictory conditions are not possible simultaneously.
\spellnotes \spell{Control weather} can do away with atmospheric phenomena (naturally occurring or otherwise) as well as create them.

\spelltime{10 minutes}
\spellrng{\rngclose}
\spellline
\spelleffect This ritual creates food and drink. The food is sufficient to sustain three creatures per caster level for 24 hours. The food that this ritual creates is simple fare of your choice -- highly nourishing, if rather bland. You can create food suitable to sustain any kind of creature, if you know what it eats.

Food created by this ritual decays and becomes inedible within 24 hours. The water created by this ritual is just like clean rain water, and does not go bad as the food does.
\spellnotes The food can be kept fresh for another 24 hours by performing a \ritual{purify food and water} ritual on it.

It is not always led in the exact direction of the destination -- if there is an impassable obstacle between the target and the destination, the ritual will direct the target around the obstacle, rather than through it.

    The guidance provided by this ritual adjusts to match whatever the target's current physical capabilities are, including flight and other unusual movement modes.

\begin{spelltarget}{One creature}
    \spelleffect When you perform this ritual, you specify a task the target must perform, or an activity the target must refrain from. The target is compelled to obey your command.

    If the target is charged to perform a task, it is still able to eat, sleep, and otherwise function normally without performing the task at all times. In general, it should spend at least 12 hours a day performing the task. However, it cannot use its free time to work against the completion of the task.

    \par If the target is prevented from obeying the command for 24 hours, it takes a \minus2 penalty to all attributes. Each day, another \minus2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of \minus8. No attribute can be reduced to less than \minus9 by this effect. All attribute penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the command.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes If the target is unable to understand the command, the ritual has no effect. The target is able to follow the literal meaning of the command rather than its intended meaning, potentially allowing it to subvert poorly worded instructions.

\par This ritual cannot be dispelled with \spell{dispel magic}. A \spell{remove curse} spell only ends the effect if its caster level is higher than this ritual's caster level.

Spells that affect metal or iron do not function on ironwood. Spells that affect wood do affect ironwood, although ironwood does not burn.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes By performing this ritual multiple times in succession, you may transform wooden objects too heavy to be affected by a single casting of the ritual. Ironwood armor and weapons created through this spell are as durable as their normal steel counterparts, and are freely usable by druids.

\spelleffect This ritual brings to your mind legends about an important person, place, or thing. The amount of information, and the speed of the ritual, depends on how much information you have about the subject.

If the person or thing is at hand, or if you are in the place in question, you learn complete and specific legends immediately after the ritual is complete.

If you only know detailed information about the subject, you learn legends that are either complete or specific, but not both, 1d10 days after the ritual is complete.

If you only know rumors about the subject, you learn incomplete and vague legends 1d10 weeks after the ritual is complete.

\spellnotes If the person, place, or thing is not of legendary importance, you gain no information. In general, characters who are 11th level and higher are ``legendary," as are the sorts of creatures they contend with, the major magic items they wield, and the places where they perform their key deeds.

\spelleffect This ritual creates an extradimensional dwelling that has a single entrance on the plane from which the ritual was performed. The entry point looks like a faint shimmering in the air that is 5 feet wide and 10 feet high. Only those you designate may enter the mansion, and the portal is shut and made invisible behind you when you enter. You may open it again from your own side at will. Once observers have passed beyond the entrance, they are in a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.
\par You can create any floor plan you desire to the limit of the spell's effect. The place is furnished and contains sufficient foodstuffs to serve a nine-course banquet to a dozen people per caster level. A staff of near-transparent servants (as many as two per caster level), liveried and obedient, wait upon all who enter. The servants function as the \spell{unseen servant} ritual, except that they are visible and can go anywhere in the mansion.

The passage can be used a number of times equal to half your caster level before the ritual is expended.

    \spelleffect The target returns to life in a new body. It must have been dead for no more than one year, and it must not have died due to old age.

    The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature's body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the target portion must have been part of the creature's body at the time of death.

    This ritual creates an entirely new body for the creature's soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. During the ritual, the body ages to match the age of the original creature at the time it died. The reincarnated creature has 0 hit points, and all negative effects are removed, even curses and missing body parts.

    A reincarnated creature is identical to the original creature in all respects, except for its race. It loses all the attribute modifiers and special abilities from its old race. It gains the attribute modifiers and special abilities of its new race. However, its racial bonus feat and languages are unchanged.

    If the target is a humanoid creature, its new race should be determined with \tref{Humanoid Reincarnations}. If not, a similar table for creatures of the same type should be used.

    Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. All of the target's spell slots and other daily abilities are expended until it rests. In addition, the target gains a negative level. If the subject was 1st level when it died, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead. This negative level or Constitution drain lasts as long as the creature remains in its its new body. This penalty can be removed by returning to the creature's proper body, as with \spell{resurrection}, or with the Racial Acclimation feat (page \featpref{Racial Acclimation}).

\spelleffect This spell instantly transports you and the subjects to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles away. Each creature can bring along objects whose weight doesn't exceed the creature's maximum load. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. After completing the spell, you and anyone bring with you must skip their next actions as they adjust to their new surroundings.
\par By doubling the casting time of the ritual, you can take along an additional Medium creature. You can repeat this process, doubling the new casting time each time, up to a maximum casting time of just over an hour (allowing you to take a total of ten Medium creatures in addition to yourself).
\par You can also bring creatures larger than Medium. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth.
\par This ritual is unusually difficult to perform correctly. You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. As part of the ritual, you make an Intelligence check against DC 10. The following categories apply modifiers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ``Very familiar" is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. You gain a \plus5 bonus.
    \item ``Studied carefully" is a place you know well, either because you can currently see it, you've been there often, or you have used other means (such as scrying) to study the place for at least one hour. No bonuses or penalties apply.
    \item ``Seen casually" is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. You take a \minus5 penalty.
    \item ``Viewed once" is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic. You take a \minus10 penalty.
    \item ``False destination" is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. You automatically fail.
\end{itemize}

Success means you arrive on target. Failure means you arrive a random distance away from your intended destination in a random direction. The distance off target is equal to 1d10\mult1d10\% of the distance that you would have traveled to your intended destination. Failure by 10 or more means you arrive in a completely different area within range that is visually or thematically similar to your intended destination.
\spellnotes This ritual is incapable of interplanar travel. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell's range, the ritual simply fails instead.

Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws. You do not apply spell resistance against this ritual.

As many as nine other Medium creatures can fit into the field with you; they can freely pass into and out of the hut without harming it. However, if you remove yourself from the hut, the spell ends.
\par The temperature inside the hut is 70\degree F if the exterior temperature is between 0\degree and 100\degree F. An exterior temperature below 0\degree or above 100\degree lowers or raises the interior temperature on a 1-degree-for-1 basis. The hut also provides protection against the elements, such as rain, dust, and sandstorms. The hut withstands any wind of less than hurricane force, but a hurricane (75\add mph wind speed) or greater force destroys it.
\par The interior of the hut is a hemisphere. Although the force field is opaque from the outside, it is transparent from within. Missiles, weapons, and most spell effects can pass through the hut without affecting it, although the occupants cannot be seen from outside the hut (they have total concealment).

\begin{comment}
You can enter any normal plant (Medium or larger) and pass any distance to a plant of the same kind in a single round, regardless of the distance separating the two. The entry plant must be alive. The destination plant need not be familiar to you, but it also must be alive. If you are uncertain of the location of a particular kind of destination plant, you need merely designate direction and distance and the transport via plants spell moves you as close as possible to the desired location. If a particular destination plant is desired but the plant is not living, the spell fails and you are ejected from the entry plant.
\par After completing the spell, you and anyone bring with you can't take any actions until the next turn that each creature would have.
\par You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. Use the following equivalents to determine the maximum number of larger creatures you can bring along: A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you.
\par You can't use this spell to travel through plant creatures.
\par The destruction of an occupied plant slays you and any creatures you have brought along, and ejects the bodies and all carried objects from the tree.

\spelltwocol{\spelltgt{One trigger object; see text}}{\spellrng{Touch}}
\spelldur{Permanent; see text}
\spellsr{Yes}
\spelleffect You imbue an object with the power to trap a creature's life and soul. The object must be inscribed with the creature's name. It holds the trapped creature indefinitely or until it is broken, which allows the creature's body to reform. Outsiders can be compelled to perform a single service for the creature releasing them; other creatures can simply go free.
\par For a creature's soul to be trapped, it must intentionally pick up or accept the object while \bloodied. If it does so, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem without the benefit of a save, though spell resistance applies normally. If it picks up the object while healthy, or if any other creature picks up the object, nothing happens, though magical inspection can reveal the existence of the trap.
\spellmat{In addition to the trigger object, a gem must be used. The gem must be worth at least 500 gp value for every level possessed by the creature to be trapped. When the ritual is performed, the gem shatters into dust which is embedded into the trigger object. If the gem is not valuable enough, the creature will suffer no ill effect when it picks up the trigger object, though the ritual's effect will still be discharged, rending the trigger object useless. (While creatures have no concept of level as such, the value of the gem needed to trap an individual can be researched. Remember that this value can change over time as creatures gain more levels.)}

\spelleffect This ritual functions like \spell{teleport}, except that it only affects you, and both the starting and ending points must be Large or larger trees.
\begin{comment}
You gain the ability to enter trees and move from inside one tree to inside another tree. The first tree you enter and all others you enter must be of the same kind, must be living, and must have girth at least equal to yours. By moving into an oak tree (for example), you instantly know the location of all other oak trees within transport range (see below) and may choose whether you want to pass into one or simply step back out of the tree you moved into. You may choose to pass to any tree of the appropriate kind within the transport range as shown on the following table.
\begin{dtable}
    \begin{tabularx}{\columnwidth}{>{\lcol}X >{\lcol}X}
        Type of Tree & Transport Range \\
        Oak, ash, yew & 3,000 feet \\

        Any coniferous & 1,000 feet \\
        All other trees & 500 feet
    \end{tabularx}
\end{dtable}
\par You may move into a tree up to one time per caster level (passing from one tree to another counts only as moving into one tree). The spell lasts until the duration expires or you exit a tree. Each transport is a full-round action.
\par You can, at your option, remain within a tree without transporting yourself, but you are forced out when the spell ends. If the tree in which you are concealed is chopped down or burned, you are slain if you do not exit before the process is complete.

This spell can even bring back creatures whose bodies have been destroyed, provided that you unambiguously identify the deceased in some fashion (reciting the deceased's time and place of birth or death is the most common method).
\par Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no negative levels, constitution drain, or loss of prepared spells.
\par You can revive someone killed by a death effect or someone who has been turned into an undead creature and then destroyed. This spell can also resurrect elementals or outsiders, but it can't resurrect constructs or undead creatures.

\spelleffect Unhallow makes a particular site, building, or structure an unholy site. This has three major effects.
\par First, the site or structure is guarded by a \spell{magic circle against good} effect.
\par Second, any dead body interred in an unhallowed site costs half the normal material components to raise as an undead creature.
\par Finally, you may choose to fix a single spell effect to the unhallowed site. The spell effect lasts for one year and functions throughout the entire site, regardless of its normal duration and area or effect. You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that share your faith or alignment, or creatures that adhere to another faith or alignment. At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting unhallow again.
\par Spell effects that may be tied to an unhallowed site include \spell{aid}, \spell{bane}, \spell{bless}, \spell{cause fear}, \spell{darkness}, \spell{daylight}, \spell{death ward}, \spell{detect evil}, \spell{dimensional anchor}, \spell{discern lies}, \spell{endure elements}, \spell{freedom of movement}, \spell{invisibility purge}, \spell{protection from energy}, \spell{remove fear}, \spell{resist energy}, \spell{silence}, \spell{tongues}, and \spell{zone of truth}.
\par Saving throws and spell resistance might apply to these spells' effects. (See the individual spell descriptions for details.)
\spellnotes An area can receive only one hallow or unhallow spell (and its associated spell effect) at a time. If an area is hallowed, it cannot be unhallowed.

\spelleffect An unseen servant is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command. It can run and fetch things, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as clean and mend. The servant can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity over and over again if told to do so as long as you remain within range. It can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, and the like. It has an effective Strength score of 2 (so it can lift 20 pounds or drag 100 pounds). It can trigger traps and such, but it can exert only 20 pounds of force, which is not enough to activate certain pressure plates and other devices. It can't perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a check using a skill that can't be used untrained. Its speed is 15 feet.
\par The servant cannot attack in any way. It cannot be killed, but it dissipates if it takes 6 points of damage from area attacks. (It gets no saves against attacks.) If you attempt to send it beyond the spell's range (measured from your current position), the servant ceases to exist.

You pose a question about some person, place, or object, then perform the ritual. If the person or object is at hand or if you are in the place in question, you receive a vision about it by succeeding on a caster level check (1d20 \add caster level) against DC 20. If only detailed information on the person, place, or object is known, the DC is 25, and the information gained is incomplete. If only rumors are known, the DC is 30, and the information gained is vague. After the spell is complete, you are exhausted.
\par If you perform this ritual while fatigued or exhausted, you must make a Fortitude save (DC 15 if fatigued or DC 20 if exhausted) or immediately fall unconscious for ten minutes. When you wake up, you remember the information (if any).

\spelleffect You send a message or sound on the wind to a designated spot. The whispering wind travels to a specific location within range that is familiar to you, provided that it can find a way to the location. A whispering wind is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches the location. It then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other sound. Note that the message is delivered regardless of whether anyone is present to hear it. The wind then dissipates.
\par You can prepare the spell to bear a message of no more than twenty-five words, cause the spell to deliver other sounds for 1 round, or merely have the whispering wind seem to be a faint stirring of the air. You can likewise cause the whispering wind to move as slowly as 1 mile per hour or as quickly as 1 mile per 10 minutes.

\spelleffect \par You alter the substance of your body to a cloudlike vapor (as the \spell{gaseous form} spell) and move through the air, possibly at great speed. You can take other creatures with you, each of which acts independently.
\par Normally, a wind walker flies at a speed of 10 feet with perfect maneuverability. If desired by the subject, a magical wind wafts a wind walker along at up to 600 feet per round (60 mph) with poor maneuverability. Wind walkers are not invisible but rather appear misty and translucent. If fully clothed in white, they are likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, or the like.
\par A wind walker can regain its physical form as desired and later resume the cloud form. Each change to and from vaporous form takes 5 rounds, which counts toward the duration of the ritual (as does any time spent in physical form). As noted above, you can dismiss the ritual, and you can even dismiss it for individual wind walkers and not others.
\par For the last minute of the ritual's duration, a wind walker in cloud form automatically descends 60 feet per round (for a total of 600 feet), though it may descend faster if it wishes. This descent serves as a warning that the ritual is about to end.
