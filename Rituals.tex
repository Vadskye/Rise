\begin{spelleffect}
\ritual{Alarm} sounds a mental or audible alarm each time a creature of Tiny or larger size enters the warded area or touches it. A creature that speaks the password (determined by you at the time of casting) does not set off the alarm. You decide at the time of casting whether the alarm will be mental or audible.
\par \subspell{Mental Alarm} A mental alarm alerts you (and only you) so long as you remain within 1 mile of the warded area. You note a single mental ``ping'' that awakens you from normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb concentration. A \ritual{silence} spell has no effect on a mental alarm.
\par \subspell{Audible Alarm} An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell. It is typically clearly audible up to 100 feet away. The sound lasts for 1 round. 
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
A \spell{silence} spell or similar effect can prevent the alarm from being heard. Ethereal or astral creatures do not trigger the alarm. \ritual{Alarm} can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

\spelldur{Instantaneous}
\spellsave{None}
\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
This ritual turns the bones or bodies of recently dead creatures into undead skeletons or zombies by binding a fragment of their souls to the corpses. The undead so created follow your spoken commands.
\par The undead can follow you, or they can remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific kind of creature) entering the place. They remain animated until they are destroyed. (A destroyed skeleton or zombie can't be animated again.)
\par Regardless of the type of undead you create with this ritual, you can't create more HV of undead than twice your caster level with a single casting of \ritual{animate dead}.
\par The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this ritual, however, you can control only 4 HV worth of undead creatures per caster level. If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control, and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled. (You choose which creatures are released.) If you are a cleric, any undead you might command by virtue of your power to command or rebuke undead do not count toward the limit.
\par \subspell{Skeletons} A skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact corpse or skeleton. The corpse must have bones. If a skeleton is made from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones.
\par \subspell{Zombies} A zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The corpse must be that of a creature with a true anatomy.
\spellmat{You must place a black onyx gem worth at least 25 gp per Hit Die of the undead into the mouth or eye socket of each corpse you intend to animate. The magic of the ritual turns these gems into worthless, burned-out shells.}

\spellrng{\rngclose}
\spelltgt{One Tiny animal}
\spelldur{One week}
\spellsave{None; see text}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
You compel a Tiny animal to go to a spot you designate. The most common use for this ritual is to get an animal to carry a message to your allies. The animal cannot be one tamed or trained by someone else, including such creatures as familiars and animal companions.
\par Using some type of food desirable to the animal as a lure, you call the animal to you. It advances and awaits your bidding. You can mentally impress on the animal a certain place well known to you or an obvious landmark. The directions must be simple, because the animal depends on your knowledge and can't find a destination on its own. You can attach some small item or note to the messenger. The animal then goes to the designated location and waits there until the duration of the ritual expires, whereupon it resumes its normal activities.
\par During this period of waiting, the messenger allows others to approach it and remove any scroll or token it carries. The intended recipient gains no special ability to communicate with the animal or read any attached message (if it's written in a language he or she doesn't know, for example).

\spelldur{24 hours (D)}
\spellsave{Will partial}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
You cause an object or location to emanate magical vibrations that repel either a specific kind of intelligent creature or creatures of a particular alignment, as defined by you. Creatures of the designated kind or alignment feel an overpowering revulsion while in the area or near the item. The kind of creature to be affected must be named specifically. A creature subtype is not specific enough. Likewise, the specific alignment to be repelled must be named.
\par An affected creature abandons the area or item, shunning it and never willingly returning to it while the ritual is in effect. A creature that makes a successful saving throw can stay in the area or touch the item but is demoralized while doing so.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
\par \ritual{Antipathy} counters and dispels \ritual{sympathy}.

\spelltime{1 minute}
\spellrng{Unlimited}
\spelleff{Magical sensor}
\spelldur{\durlong (D)}
\spellsave{None}
\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
You create an invisible magical sensor that sends you visual information. You can create the \ritual{arcane eye} at any point you can see, but it can then travel outside your line of sight without hindrance. An \ritual{arcane eye} travels at 30 feet per round (300 feet per minute) if viewing an area ahead as a human would (primarily looking at the floor ahead) or 10 feet per round (100 feet per minute) if examining the ceiling and walls as well as the floor ahead. It sees exactly as you would see if you were there.
\par The eye can travel in any direction as long as the ritual lasts. Solid barriers block its passage, but it can pass through a hole or space as small as 1 inch in diameter. The eye can't enter another plane of existence, even through a gate or similar magical portal.
\par You must concentrate to use an \ritual{arcane eye}. If you do not concentrate, the eye is inert until you again concentrate.

\spelltgt{The door, chest, or portal touched, up to 30 sq. ft./level in size}
\spelldur{Permanent}
\spellsave{None}
\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
An \ritual{arcane lock} ritual cast upon a door, chest, or portal magically locks it. You can freely pass your own \ritual{arcane lock} without affecting it; otherwise, a door or object secured with this ritual can be opened only by breaking in or with a successful \ritual{dispel magic} or \ritual{knock} spell. Add 10 to the normal DC to break open a door or portal affected by this ritual.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
A \ritual{knock} spell does not remove an arcane lock; it only suppresses the effect for 10 minutes.

\spellsave{None}
\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
You etch your personal rune or mark upon any substance without harm to the material upon which it is placed. Your personal rune or mark can consist of no more than six characters. The writing can be visible or invisible.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
If an \spell{arcane mark} is placed on a living being, normal wear gradually causes the effect to fade in about a month. Arcane mark must be cast on an object prior to casting \spell{instant summons} on the same object.

This ritual does not require any specific skill to learn or perform. You are always considered to have succeeded at the check to perform the ritual.

\spellsection{Astral Projection}

\spelldur{See text}
\spellsave{None}
\spellsr{Yes (Fortitude)}
\begin{spelleffect}
By freeing your spirit from your physical body, this ritual allows you to project an astral body onto another plane altogether.
\par You can bring the astral forms of other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects are linked in a circle with you at the time of the casting. These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you during the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them.
\par You project your astral self onto the Astral Plane, leaving your physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation. The ritual projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or carry onto the Astral Plane. Any changes to the astral copies of your equipment (such as charges used on wands and staffs) are transferred to your original equipment through the silver cord (see below). Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to any of these other planes as you will. To enter one, you leave the Astral Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of existence you have chosen to enter.
\par While you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at all times to your physical body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and physically. Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the incorporeal silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on the Material Plane, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes.
\par You and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane indefinitely. Your bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation until you choose to return your spirits to them. The ritual lasts until you desire to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as \ritual{dispel magic} cast upon either the physical body or the astral form, the breaking of the silver cord, or the destruction of your body back on the Material Plane (which kills you).
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
\par This ritual may only be cast on the Material Plane.

\spellsection{Atonement}
\spellschool{Evocation (Channeling)}
\spellskill{Religion}
\spelllvl{Divine 5}
\spelltime{1 hour}
\spellrng{Touch}
\spelltgt{Living creature touched}
\spelldur{Instantaneous}
\spellsave{None}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
This ritual removes the burden of evil acts or misdeeds from the subject. The creature seeking atonement must be truly repentant and desirous of setting right its misdeeds. If the atoning creature committed the evil act unwittingly or under some form of compulsion, \ritual{atonement} operates normally at no cost to you. However, in the case of a creature atoning for deliberate misdeeds and acts of a knowing and willful nature, you must intercede with your deity (requiring you to burn 2,500gp in offerings) in order to expunge the subject's burden. Many casters first assign a subject of this sort a quest (see \ritual{geas/quest}) or similar penance to determine whether the creature is truly contrite before casting the \ritual{atonement} ritual on its behalf.
\par \ritual{Atonement} may be cast for one of several purposes, depending on the version selected.
\par \subspell{Reverse Magical Alignment Change} If a creature has had its alignment magically changed, atonement returns its alignment to its original status at no cost in experience points.
\par \subspell{Restore Class} A paladin who has lost her class features due to committing an evil act may have her paladinhood restored to her by this ritual.
\par \subspell{Restore Cleric or Druid Spell Powers} A cleric or druid who has lost the ability to cast spells by incurring the anger of his or her deity may regain that ability by seeking \ritual{atonement} from another cleric of the same deity or another druid. If the transgression was intentional, the casting cleric must burn 2,500 in rare incense and offerings for his intercession. If the transgression was unintentional, no such offering must be made.
\par \subspell{Redemption or Temptation} You may cast this ritual upon a creature of an opposing alignment in order to offer it a chance to change its alignment to match yours. The prospective subject must be present for the entire casting process. Upon completion of the ritual, the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment. No duress, compulsion, or magical influence can force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered if it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment. This use of the ritual does not work on outsiders or any creature incapable of changing its alignment naturally.
\par Though the ritual description refers to evil acts, atonement can also be used on any creature that has performed acts against its alignment, whether those acts are evil, good, chaotic, or lawful.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
\par \subspell{Note} Normally, changing alignment is up to the player. This use of atonement simply offers a believable way for a character to change his or her alignment drastically, suddenly, and definitively.
\end{spellnotes}
\spellfocus{In addition to your holy symbol or normal divine focus, you need a set of prayer beads (or other prayer device, such as a prayer wheel or prayer book) worth at least 500 gp.}
\spellmat{When cast for the benefit of a creature whose guilt was the result of deliberate acts, 2,500gp in rare incense and offerings must be burned.}

\spellsection{Augury}
\spellschool{Divination (Knowledge)}
\spellskill{Religion}
\spelllvl{Divine 2}
\spelltime{1 minute}
\spellrng{Personal}
\spelltgt{You}
\spelldur{Instantaneous}
\begin{spelleffect}
An \ritual{augury} can tell you whether a particular action will bring good or bad results for you in the immediate future.
\par The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70\% \add 1\% per caster level, to a maximum of 90\%; this roll is made secretly. A question may be so straightforward that a successful result is automatic, or so vague as to have no chance of success. If the augury succeeds, you get one of four results:
\begin{itemize*}
\item Weal (if the action will probably bring good results).
\item Woe (for bad results).
\item Weal and woe (for both).
\item Nothing (for actions that don't have especially good or bad results).
\end{itemize*}
\par If the ritual fails, you get the ``nothing'' result. A cleric who gets the ``nothing'' result has no way to tell whether it was the consequence of a failed or successful \ritual{augury}.
\par The \ritual{augury} can see into the future only about half an hour, so anything that might happen after that does not affect the result. Thus, the result might not take into account the long-term consequences of a contemplated action. All \ritual{auguries} cast by the same person about the same topic use the same dice result as the first casting.

\begin{spelleffect}
You awaken a tree or animal to humanlike sentience.
\par The \ritual{awakened} animal or tree is friendly toward you. You have no special empathy or connection with a creature you awaken, although it serves you in specific tasks or endeavors if you communicate your desires to it.
\par An \ritual{awakened} tree has characteristics as if it were an animated object, except that it gains the plant type and its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are each 3d6. An \ritual{awakened} plant gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it has senses similar to a human's.
\par An \ritual{awakened} animal gets 3d6 Intelligence, \plus1d3 Charisma, and \plus2 HV. Its type becomes magical beast (augmented animal). An \ritual{awakened} animal can't serve as an animal companion, familiar, or special mount.
\par An \ritual{awakened} tree or animal can speak one language that you know, plus one additional language that you know per point of Intelligence bonus (if any).
\end{spelleffect}
\spellmat{Herbs and oils worth no less than 2,000gp must be applied to the animal or plant to be awakened.}

\spellsection{Binding}

\spellrng{\rngclose}
\spelltgt{One living creature}
\spelldur{See text (D)}
\spellsave{Will negates; see text}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
A \ritual{binding} ritual creates a magical restraint to hold a creature. The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Values equal at least one-half your caster level.
\par You may have as many as four assistants help you with the ritual. For each assistant who casts \ritual{suggestion}, your caster level for this casting of \ritual{binding} increases by 1. For each assistant who casts \ritual{dominate animal}, \ritual{dominate person}, or \ritual{dominate monster}, your caster level for this casting of \ritual{binding} increases by a number equal to one-third of that assistant's level, provided that the spell's target is appropriate for a \ritual{binding} ritual. Since the assistants' spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the \ritual{binding} ritual, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants' spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the \ritual{binding} lasts. All \ritual{binding} rituals are dismissible.
\par Regardless of the version of \ritual{binding} you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the ritual and release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the condition must be reasonable and have a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Values, or hit points don't qualify. Once the ritual is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2.
\par If you are casting any of the first three versions of \ritual{binding} (those with limited durations), you may cast additional \ritual{binding} rituals to prolong the effect, since the durations overlap. If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first ritual's duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw. If the creature succeeds on this save, all the \ritual{binding} rituals it has received are broken.
\par The \ritual{binding} ritual has six versions. Choose one of the following versions when you cast the ritual.
\par \subspell{Chaining} The subject is confined by restraints that generate an \ritual{antipathy} ritual affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. The duration is one year per caster level. The subject of this form of \ritual{binding} is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the ritual. This is an Enchantment (Emotion) [Mind-Affecting] effect.
\par \subspell{Slumber} This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as one year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age. This form of \ritual{binding} is more difficult to cast than \subspell{chaining}, making it slightly easier to resist. Reduce the ritual's save DC by 1. This is an Enchantment/Transmutation (Inhibition, Temporal) [Mind-Affecting] effect.
\par \subspell{Bound Slumber} This combination of \emph{chaining} and \emph{slumber} lasts for as long as one month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2. This is an Enchantment/Transmutation (Inhibition, Temporal) [Mind-Affecting] effect.
\par \subspell{Hedged Prison} The subject is teleported into within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means. The effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3. This is a Conjuration (Translocation) [Teleportation] effect.
\par \subspell{Metamorphosis} The subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The \ritual{binding} is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while \emph{metamorphosed}, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4. This is a Transmutation (Polymorph) effect.
\par \subspell{Minimus Containment} The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object. The \ritual{binding} is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while \subspell{contained}, but it ages normally. Reduce the save DC by 4. This is a Transmutation (Polymorph, Temporal) [Size-Affecting] effect.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
A \ritual{binding} ritual cannot be dispelled with \ritual{dispel magic} or a similar effect, though an \ritual{antimagic field} or \ritual{mage's disjunction} affects it normally. A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its home plane due to \ritual{dismissal}, \ritual{banishment}, or a similar effect.

\begin{spelleffect}
This ritual frees the subject from enchantments, transmutations, and curses. \ritual{Break enchantment} can reverse even an instantaneous effect. For each such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 \add caster level) against a DC of 11 \add caster level of the effect. Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect. For a cursed magic item, the DC is 25.
\par If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by \ritual{dispel magic}, \ritual{break enchantment} works only if that spell is 5th level or lower.
\par If the effect comes from some permanent magic item, \ritual{break enchantment} does not remove the curse from the item, but it does frees the victim from the item's effects.

\ritual{Clairaudience/clairvoyance} creates an invisible magical sensor at a specific location that enables you to hear or see (your choice) almost as if you were there. You don't need line of sight or line of effect, but the locale must be known -- a place familiar to you or an obvious one. Once you have selected the locale, the sensor doesn't move, but you can rotate it in all directions to view the area as desired. Unlike other scrying spells or rituals, this ritual does not allow magically or supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it. If the chosen locale is magically dark, you see nothing. If it is naturally pitch black, you can see in a Small (10 ft.) radius around the center of the ritual's effect. \ritual{Clairaudience/clairvoyance} functions only on the plane of existence you are currently occupying.

\begin{spelleffect}
This ritual makes an inert duplicate of a creature. If the original individual has been slain, its soul immediately transfers to the clone, creating a replacement (provided that the soul is free and willing to return). The original's physical remains, should they still exist, become inert and cannot thereafter be restored to life. If the original creature has reached the end of its natural life span (that is, it has died of natural causes), any cloning attempt fails.
\par To create the duplicate, you must have a piece of flesh (not hair, nails, scales, or the like) with a volume of at least 1 cubic inch that was taken from the original creature's living body. The piece of flesh need not be fresh, but it must be kept from rotting. Once the ritual is cast, the duplicate must be grown in a laboratory for 2d4 months.
\par When the clone is completed, the original's soul enters it immediately, if that creature is already dead. The clone is physically identical with the original and possesses the same personality and memories as the original. In other respects, treat the clone as if it were the original character raised from the dead. If Constitution drain would give the clone a Constitution score of 0, the ritual fails.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
\par The ritual duplicates only the original's body and mind, not its equipment.
\par A duplicate can be grown while the original still lives, or when the original soul is unavailable, but the resulting body is merely a soulless bit of inert flesh, which rots if not preserved.

You are allowed one such question per caster level. The answers given are correct within the limits of the entity's knowledge. ``Unclear" is a legitimate answer, because powerful beings of the Outer Planes are not necessarily omniscient. In cases where a one-word answer would be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, a short phrase (five words or less) may be given as an answer instead.
\par The ritual, at best, provides information to aid character decisions. The entities contacted structure their answers to further their own purposes. If you lag, discuss the answers, or go off to do anything else, the ritual ends.

\begin{spelleffect}
You send your mind to another plane of existence (an Elemental Plane or some plane farther removed) in order to receive advice and information from powers there. (See the accompanying table for possible consequences and results of the attempt.) The powers reply in a language you understand, but they resent such contact and give only brief answers to your questions. (All questions are answered with ``yes," ``no," ``maybe," ``never," ``irrelevant," or some other one-word answer.)
\par You must concentrate on maintaining the ritual (a standard action) in order to ask questions at the rate of one per round. A question is answered by the power during the same round. For every two caster levels, you may ask one question.
\par Contact with minds far removed from your home plane increases the probability that you will incur a decrease to Intelligence and Charisma, but the chance of the power knowing the answer, as well as the probability of the entity answering correctly, are likewise increased by moving to distant planes.
\par Once the Outer Planes are reached, the power of the deity contacted determines the effects. (Random results obtained from the table are subject to the personalities of individual deities.)

Outer Plane, greater deity & DC 16/5 weeks & 01--88 & 89--90 & 91--99 & 100
\end{tabularx}
\par Avoid Int/Cha Decrease: You must succeed on an Intelligence check against this DC to avoid a decrease in Intelligence and Charisma. If the check fails, your Intelligence and Charisma scores each fall to 8 for the stated duration, and you become unable to cast arcane spells. If you lose Intelligence and Charisma, the effect strikes as soon as the first question is asked, and no answer is received. (The entries in parentheses are for questions that pertain to the appropriate Elemental Plane.)
\parhead{Results of a Successful Contact} d\% is rolled for the result shown on the table:
\par True Answer: You get a true, one-word answer. Questions that cannot be answered in this way are answered randomly.
\par Don't Know: The entity tells you that it doesn't know.
\par Lie: The entity intentionally lies to you.
\par Random Answer: The entity tries to lie but doesn't know the answer, so it makes one up.

You change the weather in the local area. It takes 10 minutes to cast the spell and an additional 10 minutes for the effects to manifest. You can call forth weather appropriate to the climate and season of the area you are in.
\begin{dtable}
\begin{tabularx}{\columnwidth}{l >{\lcol}X}

Spring & Tornado, thunderstorm, sleet storm, or hot weather \\

Winter & Frigid cold, blizzard, or thaw \\
Late winter & Hurricane-force winds or early spring (coastal area)	 \\
\end{tabularx}
\end{dtable}
\par You control the general tendencies of the weather, such as the direction and intensity of the wind. You cannot control specific applications of the weather -- where lightning strikes, for example, or the exact path of a tornado. When you select a certain weather condition to occur, the weather assumes that condition 10 minutes later (changing gradually, not abruptly). The weather continues as you left it for the duration, or until you use a standard action to designate a new kind of weather (which fully manifests itself 10 minutes later). Contradictory conditions are not possible simultaneously.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
\spell{Control weather} can do away with atmospheric phenomena (naturally occurring or otherwise) as well as create them. A druid casting this spell doubles the duration and affects a circle with a 3-mile radius.

The food that this ritual creates is simple fare of your choice -- highly nourishing, if rather bland. Food so created decays and becomes inedible within 24 hours, although it can be kept fresh for another 24 hours by casting a \ritual{purify food and water} spell on it. The water created by this ritual is just like clean rain water, and it doesn't go bad as the food does.

This spell generates wholesome, drinkable water, just like clean rain water. Water can be created in an area as small as will actually contain the liquid, or in an area three times as large -- possibly creating a downpour or filling many small receptacles.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
Conjuration spells can't create substances or objects within a creature. Water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon. One cubic foot of water contains roughly 8 gallons and weighs about 60 pounds.

\begin{spelleffect}
A much more potent ritual than \ritual{animate dead}, this evil ritual allows you to create more powerful sorts of undead: ghouls, ghasts, mummies, and mohrgs. The type or types of undead you can create is based on your caster level, as shown on the table below.
\begin{dtable}
\begin{tabularx}{\columnwidth}{*{2}{>{\lcol}X}}

12th--14th & Ghast \\
15th--17th & Mummy \\

\end{spellnotes}
\spellmat{A clay pot filled with grave dirt and another filled with brackish water. The ritual must be cast on a dead body which has been dead for no more than one day per caster level.

\begin{spelleffect}
This ritual functions like \ritual{sending}, but the message can also contain a \ritual{suggestion} (see the \ritual{suggestion} spell), which the subject does its best to carry out. A successful Will save negates the \ritual{suggestion} effect but not the contact itself. The \ritual{demand}, if received, is understood even if the subject's Intelligence score is as low as 1. If the message is impossible or meaningless according to the circumstances that exist for the subject at the time the demand is issued, the message is understood but the \ritual{suggestion} is ineffective.
\par The demand's message to the creature must be twenty-five words or less, including the \ritual{suggestion}. The creature can also give an equally short reply immediately.

\begin{spelleffect}
You immediately become aware of any attempt to observe you by means of a divination (scrying) spell or effect. The ritual's area radiates from you and moves as you move. You know the location of every magical sensor within the ritual's area.
\par If the scrying attempt originates within the area, you also know its location; otherwise, you and the scrier immediately make opposed caster level checks (1d20 \add caster level). If you at least match the scrier's result, you get a visual image of the scrier and an accurate sense of his or her direction and distance from you.

\spelldur{Instantaneous}
\spellsave{None}
\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
This ritual is among the most powerful means of locating creatures or objects. Nothing short of a \spell{mind blank} spell or the direct intervention of a deity keeps you from learning the exact location of a single individual or object. \spell{Discern location} circumvents normal means of protection from scrying or location. The ritual reveals the name of the creature or object's location (place, name, business name, building name, or the like), community, county (or similar political division), country, continent, and the plane of existence where the target lies.
\par To find a creature with the ritual, you must have seen the creature or have some item that once belonged to it. To find an object, you must have touched it at least once.

Extradimensional travel into or out of the spell's area is impossible. All Conjuration (Translocation) and Conjuration (Summoning) effects are prohibited, as well as \spell{astral projection} and similar spell-like or psionic abilities.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
\par A dimensional lock does not interfere with the movement of creatures already in ethereal or astral form when the spell is cast, nor does it block extradimensional perception or attack forms. Also, the spell does not prevent summoned creatures from disappearing at the end of a summoning spell.

\begin{spelleffect}
Similar to \spell{augury} but more powerful, a \spell{divination} spell can provide you with a useful piece of advice in reply to a question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within one week. The advice can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. If your party doesn't act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful. The base chance for a correct divination is 70\% \add 1\% per caster level, to a maximum of 90\%. If the dice roll fails, you know the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is at work.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
\par As with \spell{augury}, multiple divinations about the same topic by the same caster use the same dice result as the first divination spell and yield the same answer each time.

\begin{spelleffect}
You, or a messenger touched by you, sends a phantasmal message to others in the form of a dream. At the beginning of the spell, you must name the recipient or identify him or her by some title that leaves no doubt as to identity. The messenger then enters a trance, appears in the intended recipient's dream, and delivers the message. The message can be of any length, and the recipient remembers it perfectly upon waking. The communication is one-way. The recipient cannot ask questions or offer information, nor can the messenger gain any information by observing the dreams of the recipient.
\par Once the message is delivered, the messenger's mind returns instantly to its body. The duration of the spell is the time required for the messenger to enter the recipient's dream and deliver the message.
\par If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, the messenger can choose to wake up (ending the spell) or remain in the trance. The messenger can remain in the trance until the recipient goes to sleep, then enter the recipient's dream and deliver the message as normal. A messenger that is disturbed during the trance comes awake, ending the spell.
\par Creatures who don't sleep (such as elves, but not half-elves) or don't dream cannot be contacted by this spell.
\par The messenger is unaware of its own surroundings or of the activities around it while in the trance. It is defenseless both physically and mentally (always fails any saving throw) while in the trance.

Erase removes writings of either magical or mundane nature from a scroll or from one or two pages of paper, parchment, or similar surfaces. Nonmagical writing is automatically erased. To erase magical writing, you must succeed on a caster level check against a DC of 11 \add the caster level of the magic. 
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
With this spell, you can remove \spell{explosive runes}, a \spell{glyph of warding}, a \spell{sepia snake sigil}, or an \spell{arcane mark}, but not \spell{illusory script} or a \spellindirect{symbol of death}{symbol} spell. If you fail to erase \spell{explosive runes}, a \spell{glyph of warding}, or a \spell{sepia snake sigil}, you accidentally activate that writing instead.

\begin{spelleffect}
You trace these mystic runes upon a book, map, scroll, or similar object bearing written information. The runes detonate when read, dealing damage to everything in the area, including the object.
\par You and any characters you specifically instruct can read the protected writing without triggering the runes. Likewise, you can remove the runes whenever desired. Another creature can remove them with a successful \spell{dispel magic} or \spell{erase} spell, but attempting to dispel or erase the runes and failing to do so triggers the explosion.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
The object receives no saving throw against the explosion. Magic traps such as \spell{explosive runes} can be detected with the Spot skill and disabled with the Disable Device skill. The DC is 25 \add spell level, or DC 28 for \spell{explosive runes}.

You convert material of one sort into a product that is of the same material. Creatures or magic items cannot be created or transmuted by the fabricate spell. The quality of items made by this spell is commensurate with the quality of material used as the basis for the new fabrication. If you work with a mineral, the target is reduced to 10 cubic feet instead of 100 cubic feet.
\par You must make an appropriate Craft check to fabricate articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship, such as armor, or an appropriate Engineering check to fabricate objects requiring complex engineering, such as a ballista.
\par Casting requires 1 minute per 10 cubic feet (or 1 cubic foot) of material to be affected by the spell.

\spellsave{Will negates (harmless)}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specified destination, be it the way into or out of a locale. The locale can be outdoors, underground, or even inside a \spell{maze} spell. Find the path works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures at a locale. The location must be on the same plane as you are at the time of casting.
\par The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will eventually lead it to its destination, indicating at appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions to take. For example, the spell enables the subject to sense trip wires or the proper word to bypass a \spell{glyph of warding}. The spell ends when the destination is reached or the duration expires, whichever comes first. Find the path can be used to remove the subject and its companions from the effect of a maze spell in a single round.
\end{spelleffect}

This divination is keyed to the recipient, not its companions, and its effect does not predict or allow for the actions of creatures (including guardians).

The subject gains an intuitive insight into the workings of traps. She gain a bonus equal to one-half your caster level on Spot checks made to find traps while the spell is in effect. In addition, she gains the trapfinding ability as a rogue (if she did not already have it). As a full-round action, the subject may move up 10 feet while searching every square within 10 feet of her for traps. If she detects a trap partway through her movement, she may immediately stop moving.

\spelldmg{3d6 fire damage \add d6 per four levels after 6th}
\begin{spelleffect}
This spell trap creates a fiery explosion when an intruder opens the item that the trap protects. A fire trap can ward any object that can be opened and closed.
\par When casting \spell{fire trap}, you select a point on the object as the spell's center. When someone other than you opens the object, everyone within a \areasmall radius burst of the spell's center takes fire damage. The item protected by the trap is not harmed by this explosion.
\par You can use the trapped object without discharging the trap, as can any individual to whom the object was specifically attuned when cast. Attuning a fire trapped object to an individual usually involves setting a password that you can share.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
\par A fire trapped item cannot have a second closure or warding spell placed on it. A \spell{knock} spell does not bypass a \spell{fire trap}. An unsuccessful dispel magic spell does not detonate the spell. Underwater, this ward deals half damage and creates a large cloud of steam.
\par Magic traps such as \spell{fire trap} can be detected with the Spot skill and disabled with the Disable Device skill. The DC is 25 \add spell level, or DC 28 for \spell{fire trap}. No more than one magic trap can be placed on the same object or in the same area.

You create a slightly concave, circular plane of force that follows you about and carries loads for you. The disk is 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch deep at its center. It can hold 100 pounds of weight per caster level. (If used to transport a liquid, its capacity is 2 gallons.) The disk floats approximately 3 feet above the ground at all times and remains level. It floats along horizontally within spell range and will accompany you at a rate of no more than your normal speed each round.

\begin{spelleffect}
This spell seals an area against all planar travel into or within it. This includes all Teleportation (Translocation) spells (such as dimension door and teleport), plane shifting, astral travel, ethereal travel, and all summoning spells. Such effects simply fail automatically.
\par In addition, it damages entering creatures whose alignments are different from yours. The effect on those attempting to enter the warded area is based on their alignment relative to yours (see below). A creature inside the area when the spell is cast takes no damage unless it exits the area and attempts to reenter, at which time it is affected as normal.
\par \subspell{Alignments identical} No effect. The creature may enter the area freely (although not by planar travel).
\par \subspell{Alignments different with respect to either law/chaos or good/evil} The creature takes 8d6 points of damage. A successful Will save halves the damage, and spell resistance applies.
\par \subspell{Alignments different with respect to both law/chaos and good/evil} The creature takes 8d8 points of damage. A successful Will save halves the damage, and spell resistance applies.
\par At your option, the abjuration can include a password, in which case creatures of alignments different from yours can avoid the damage by speaking the password as they enter the area. You must select this option (and the password) at the time of casting.

\begin{spelleffect}
Casting a gate spell creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction.
\par The gate itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster's choice), oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.
\par A \spell{gate} has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the gate from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.
\par A \spell{gate} spell functions much like a \spell{plane shift} spell, except that the gate opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a gate from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you -- anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A gate cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.
\par You may hold the \spell{gate} open only for a brief time (no more than 5 rounds), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.

\begin{spelleffect}
The subject must carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by you. The creature must be able to understand you. While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.
The geased creature must follow the given instructions for at least 12 hours a day until the geas is completed, no matter how long it takes. If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one week. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions.
\par If the subject is prevented from completing its task for 24 hours, it takes a \minus2 penalty to all attribute scores. Each day, another \minus2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of \minus8. No attribute score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The attribute score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the geas.
\end{spelleffect}

\par Depending on the version selected, a glyph either blasts the intruder or activates a spell.
\par \subspell{Blast Glyph} A blast glyph deals damage to everything in \areasmall radius burst of the intruder. A succcessful Reflex save halves the damage.
\par \subspell{Spell Glyph} You can store any harmful spell of 3rd level or lower that you know into the glyph. An intruder that activates the glyph is the target of the spell or the center of the spell's effect, as appropriate. If the spell summons creatures, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack. Saving throws and spell resistance operate as normal for the stored spell.

Spells that affect metal or iron do not function on ironwood. Spells that affect wood do affect ironwood, although ironwood does not burn. Using this spell with wood shape or a wood-related Craft check, you can fashion wooden items that function as steel items.

If you have only detailed information on the person, place, or thing, the casting time is 1d10 days, and the resulting lore is less complete and specific (though it often provides enough information to help you find the person, place, or thing, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time). If you know only rumors, the casting time is 2d6 weeks, and the resulting lore is vague and incomplete (though it often directs you to more detailed information, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time).
\par During the casting, you cannot engage in other than routine activities: eating, sleeping, and so forth. When completed, the divination brings legends (if any) about the person, place, or things to your mind. These may be legends that are still current, legends that have been forgotten, or even information that has never been generally known. If the person, place, or thing is not of legendary importance, you gain no information. As a rule of thumb, characters who are 11th level and higher are ``legendary," as are the sorts of creatures they contend with, the major magic items they wield, and the places where they perform their key deeds.

The tree on which the spell is cast must be within 10 feet of your dwelling place, within a place sacred to you, or within 300 feet of something that you wish to guard or protect.
\par Liveoak must be cast on a healthy, Huge oak. A triggering phrase of up to one word per caster level is placed on the targeted oak. The liveoak spell triggers the tree into animating as a treant.

The hound immediately starts barking loudly if any Small or larger creature approaches within 30 feet of it. (Those within 30 feet of the hound when it is conjured may move about in the area, but if they leave and return, they activate the barking.) The hound sees invisible and ethereal creatures. It does not react to figments, but it does react to shadow illusions.
\par If an intruder approaches to within 5 feet of the hound, the dog stops barking and delivers a vicious bite (\plus10 attack bonus, 2d6\plus3 points of piercing damage) once per round. The dog also gets the bonuses appropriate to an invisible creature.
\par The dog is considered ready to bite intruders, so it delivers its first bite on the intruder's turn. Its bite is the equivalent of a magic weapon for the purpose of damage reduction. The hound cannot be attacked, but it can be dispelled.
\par The spell lasts for 1 hour per caster level, but once the hound begins barking, it lasts only 1 round per caster level. If you are ever more than 100 feet distant from the hound, the spell ends.

Only those you designate may enter the mansion, and the portal is shut and made invisible behind you when you enter. You may open it again from your own side at will. Once observers have passed beyond the entrance, they are in a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.
\par You can create any floor plan you desire to the limit of the spell's effect. The place is furnished and contains sufficient foodstuffs to serve a nine-course banquet to a dozen people per caster level. A staff of near-transparent servants (as many as two per caster level), liveried and obedient, wait upon all who enter. The servants function as unseen servant spells except that they are visible and can go anywhere in the mansion.

You alter an item's aura so that it registers  to  detect spells (and spells with similar  capabilities) as though it were less magical, or a magic item of a kind you specify, or the subject of a spell you specify. You can increase or decrease the strength of the aura of an item by an amount up to your caster level. For example, if you have a caster level of 8, you could alter a magic item with a caster level of 6 to make it seem as if it were nonmagical, or you could make it seem as if it had a caster level of 14.
\par If the object bearing \spell{magic aura}  has \spell{identify} cast on it or is similarly examined, the examiner recognizes that the aura is false and detects the object's actual qualities if he succeeds on a Will save.
\par Otherwise, he believes the aura and no  amount of testing reveals what the true  magic is.
\par If the targeted item's own aura is exceptionally powerful (if it is an artifact, for  instance), \spell{magic aura} doesn't work.

The message, which must be twenty-five or fewer words long, can be in any language known by you and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes. The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak. Of course, magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object or creature.
\par The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A magic mouth cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Values, or class except by external garb.
\par The range limit of a trigger is 100 feet. Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.

This spell functions like mending, except that make whole completely repairs an object made of any substance, even one with multiple breaks, to be as strong as new. The spell does not restore the magical abilities of a broken magic item made whole, and it cannot mend broken magic rods, staffs, or wands. The spell does not repair items that have been warped, burned, disintegrated, ground to powder, melted, or vaporized, nor does it affect creatures (including constructs).

You draw an indelible mark on the subject and state some behavior on the part of the subject that will activate the mark. When activated, the mark curses the subject. Typically, you designate some sort of criminal behavior that activates the mark, but you can pick any act you please. The effect of the mark is identical with the effect of bestow curse.
\par Since this spell takes 10 minutes to cast and involves writing on the target, you can cast it only on a creature that is willing or restrained.
\par Like the effect of bestow curse, a mark of justice cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell. Remove curse works only if its caster level is equal to or higher than your mark of justice caster level. These restrictions apply regardless of whether the mark has activated.

Mending repairs small breaks or tears in objects (but not warps, such as might be caused by a \spell{warp wood} spell). It will weld broken metallic objects such as a ring, a chain link, a medallion, or a slender dagger, providing but one break exists.
\par Ceramic or wooden objects with multiple breaks can be invisibly rejoined to be as strong as new. A hole in a leather sack or a wineskin is completely healed over by \spell{mending}. The spell can repair items which are magical, but the item's magical abilities are not restored.

The subject is protected from all devices and spells that detect, influence, or read emotions or thoughts. This spell protects against all mind-affecting spells and effects as well as information gathering by divination spells or effects. Mind blank even foils limited wish, miracle, and wish spells when they are used in such a way as to affect the subject's mind or to gain information about it. In the case of scrying that scans an area the creature is in, such as arcane eye, the spell works but the creature simply isn't detected.

The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements. Unlike hallucinatory terrain, the spell can alter the appearance of structures (or add them where none are present).

\begin{spelleffect}
By means of this spell, you misdirect the information from divination spells that reveal auras (detect evil, detect magic, discern lies, and the like). On casting the spell, you choose another object within range. For the duration of the spell, the subject of misdirection is detected as if it were the other object. (Neither the subject nor the other object gets a saving throw against this effect.) Detection spells provide information based on the second object rather than on the actual target of the detection unless the caster of the detection succeeds on a Will save. For instance, you could make yourself detect as a tree if one were within range at casting: not evil, not lying, not magical, neutral in alignment, and so forth. This spell does not affect other types of divination magic (augury, detect thoughts, clairaudience/clairvoyance, and the like).

\begin{spelleffect}
Move earth moves dirt (clay, loam, sand), possibly collapsing embankments, moving hillocks, shifting dunes, and so forth.
\par However, in no event can rock formations be collapsed or moved. The area to be affected determines the casting time. For every 150-foot square (up to 10 feet deep), casting takes 10 minutes. The maximum area, 750 feet by 750 feet, takes 4 hours and 10 minutes to move.
\par This spell does not violently break the surface of the ground. Instead, it creates wavelike crests and troughs, with the earth reacting with glacierlike fluidity until the desired result is achieved. Trees, structures, rock formations, and such are mostly unaffected except for changes in elevation and relative topography.
\par The spell cannot be used for tunneling and is generally too slow to trap or bury creatures. Its primary use is for digging or filling moats or for adjusting terrain contours before a battle.

A poisoned  creature suffers no additional effects from  the poison, and any temporary effects are ended, but the spell does not reverse  instantaneous effects, such as hit point  damage, temporary ability damage, or  effects that don't go away on their own.
\par The creature is immune to any poison it  is exposed to during the duration of the  spell. Unlike with delay poison, such effects aren't postponed until after the duration - the creature need not make any saves  against poison effects applied to it during  the length of the spell. This spell can instead neutralize the  poison in a poisonous creature or object  for the duration of the spell, at the caster's  option.

The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination spells such as clairaudience/clairvoyance, locate object, and detect spells. Nondetection also prevents location by such magic items as crystal balls. If a divination is attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 \add caster level) against a DC of 11 \add the caster level of the spellcaster who cast nondetection. If you cast nondetection on yourself or on an item currently in your possession, the DC is 15 \add your caster level.

You can learn details of an inanimate object's previous owner. Objects accumulate psychic impressions left by their previous owners, which can be read by use of this power. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular object.
\par 1st Minute: Last owner's race.
\par 2nd Minute: Last owner's gender.
\par 3rd Minute: Last owner's age.
\par 4th Minute: Last owner's alignment.
\par 5th Minute: How last owner gained and lost the object.
\par 6th\add Minute: Next-to-last owner's race, and so on.
\par The power always correctly identifies the last owner of the item. Each owner after the first has a 10\% chance to be skipped. This chance increases by 10\% per previous owner; the second owner has a 10\% chance to be skipped, the third owner has a 20\% chance to be skipped, and so on. The spell can never reveal an owner beyond the tenth owner.
\par This power will not identify casual users as owners. (Anyone who uses an object to attack someone or something is not thereafter considered a casual user.)
\par You can continue to run through a list of previous owners and learn details about them as long as the spell's duration lasts.

\begin{spelleffect}
Casting this spell attempts a dangerous act: to lure a creature from another plane to a specifically prepared trap. The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom.
\par The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual's proper name in casting the spell.
\par The chosen creature is allowed a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from being called).
\par The trap takes the form of a magic circle which you inscribe in the ground. The trapped creature and all of its abilities cannot cross the circle's boundaries and can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the creature has any form of dimensional travel, it can leave the circle through that means. Once per day, the trapped creature can attempt to escape, forcing you to overcome its spell resistance to keep it trapped. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you.
\par If you spend two hours performing the ritual, you can make make it more secure. This allows you to add a \spell{dimensional anchor} spell, a \spell{dimensional lock} spell, or other similar effect to the trap before the creature is summoned. If you do so, the effects last as long as the creature remains in the trap. In addition, if you make the magic circle more secure in this way, the trapped creature cannot use its spell resistance to break out of the trap.
\par If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a Diplomacy check. If you fail, the creature refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you roll a 1 on the Diplomacy check, the creature breaks free of the binding and can escape or attack you.
\par Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only so inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete though its own actions the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free. Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions.
\par When you use a calling ritual to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a ritual of that type.

Prestidigitations are minor tricks that novice spellcasters use for practice. Once cast, a \spell{prestidigitation} spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour on objects or creatures within \rngclose range of you. The effects are minor and have severe limitations. A prestidigitation can slowly lift 1 pound of material. It can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round. It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material. It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters. \spell{Prestidigitation} can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created by a prestidigitation spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
A \spell{prestidigitation} lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour. Attended objects, such as the clothes a creature is wearing, cannot be affected.

This ritual does not require any specific skill to learn or perform. You are always considered to have succeeded at the check to perform the ritual.

This spell functions like silent image, except that this spell's figment activates when a specific condition occurs. The figment includes visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal elements, including intelligible speech.

You set the triggering condition (which may be a special word) when casting the spell. The event that triggers the illusion can be as general or as specific and detailed as desired but must be based on an audible, tactile, olfactory, or visual trigger. The trigger cannot be based on some quality not normally obvious to the senses, such as alignment. (See magic mouth for more details about such triggers.)

You create a number of semitangible, visible magical orbs (called ``eyes") equal to your caster level. These eyes move out, scout around, and return as you direct them when casting the spell. Each eye can see 120 feet (normal vision only) in all directions.
\par While the individual eyes are quite fragile, they're small and difficult to spot. Each eye is a Fine construct, about the size of a small apple, that has 1 hit point, AC 18 (\plus8 bonus for its size), flies at a speed of 30 feet with perfect maneuverability, and has a \plus16 Hide and Move Silently modifier. It has a Spot modifier equal to your caster level and is subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that would affect your ability to receive visual information about your surroundings. An eye traveling through darkness must find its way by touch.
\par When you create the eyes, you specify instructions you want them to follow in a command of no more than twenty-five words. Any knowledge you possess is known by the eyes as well.
\par In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to your hand. Each replays in your mind all it has seen during its existence. It takes an eye 1 round to replay 1 hour of recorded images. After relaying its findings, an eye disappears.
\par If an eye ever gets more than 1 mile away from you, it instantly ceases to exist. However, your link with the eye is such that you won't know if the eye was destroyed because it wandered out of range or because of some other event.
\par The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level or until they return to you.

\begin{spelleffect}
You restore life to a deceased creature. You can raise a creature that has been dead for no longer than thirty days. In addition, the subject's soul must be free and willing to return. If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.
\par Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject gains a negative level. If the subject was 1st level when it died, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead. This negative level or Constitution drain lasts for one month, or until the subject next gains a level. A character who died with spells prepared has a 50\% chance of losing any given spell upon being raised, in addition to losing spells for losing a level. A spellcasting creature that doesn't prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50\% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell, in addition to losing spell slots for losing a level.
\par A raised creature has 10 critical damage, unless that would be enough to kill the creature, in which case it has one less than its maximum critical damage. Any attribute scores damaged to 0 are raised to 1. Normal poison and normal disease are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and curses are not undone. While the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to be raised must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is brought back to life. None of the dead creature's equipment or possessions are affected in any way by this spell.
\par A creature who has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can't be raised by this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be raised. The spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age.

Furthermore, once the spell is cast and you have read the magical inscription, you are thereafter able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of \spell{read magic}. You can read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute.

You create powerful magic in some specially prepared object. This object contains the power to instantly transport its possessor across any distance within the same plane to your abode. Once the item is transmuted, you must give it willingly to a creature and at the same time inform it of a command word to be spoken when the item is used. To make use of the item, the subject speaks the command word at the same time that it rends or breaks the item (a standard action). When this is done, the individual and all objects it is wearing and carrying (to a maximum of the character's heavy load) are instantly transported to your abode. No other creatures are affected (aside from a familiar that is touching the subject).
\par You can alter the spell when casting it so that it transports you to within 10 feet of the possessor of the item when it is broken and the command word spoken. You will have a general idea of the location and situation of the item possessor at the time the refuge spell is discharged, but once you decide to alter the spell in this fashion, you have no choice whether or not to be transported.

\begin{spelleffect}
With this spell, you bring back a dead creature in another body, provided that its death occurred no more than one week before the casting of the spell and the subject's soul is free and willing to return. If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.
\par Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains and the cause of death, except death from old age, is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature's body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature's body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.
\par A reincarnated creature recalls the its former life and form. It retains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks it formerly possessed, except those granted by its previous race. Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores depend partly on the new body. First eliminate the subject's racial adjustments (since it is no longer of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining attribute scores. The subject gains a permanent negative level. (If this reduction would put its effective level at 0, it can't be reincarnated). This negative level lasts for one month, or until the subject next gains a level.
\par It's possible for the change in the subject's attribute scores to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class. If this is the case, the subject is well advised to become a multiclass character.
\par For a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the following table. For nonhumanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created.
\par Any effect that would prevent a resurrection spell from bringing a creature back from the dead also prevents reincarnate from bringing the creature back. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be reincarnated. The spell cannot bring back a creature who has died of old age.

When this spell is cast upon a piece of rope from 5 to 30 feet long, one end of the rope rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground, as if affixed at the upper end. The upper end is, in fact, fastened to an extradimensional space that is outside the multiverse of extradimensional spaces (``planes''). Creatures in the extradimensional space are hidden, beyond the reach of spells (including divinations), unless those spells work across planes. The space takes the form of a cube twenty feet on each side. The rope can support up to 16,000 pounds. A weight greater than that can pull the rope free.
\par Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see out of it as if a 3-foot by 5-foot window were centered on the rope. The window is present on the Material Plane, but it's invisible, and even creatures that can see the window can't see through it. Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends. The rope can be climbed by only one person at a time.

If any living creatures are in the chest, there is a 75\% chance that the spell simply fails. Once the chest is hidden, you can retrieve it by concentrating (a standard action), and it appears next to you.
\par The chest must be exceptionally well crafted and expensive, constructed for you by master crafters. The cost of such a chest is never less than 5,000 gp. Once it is constructed, you must make a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every detail), so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy. (The replica costs 50 gp.) You can have but one pair of these chests at any given time -- even a wish spell does not allow more. The chests are nonmagical and can be fitted with locks, wards, and so on, just as any normal chest can be.
\par To hide the chest, you cast the ritual while touching both the chest and the replica. The chest vanishes into the Ethereal Plane. You need the replica to recall the chest. After sixty days, there is a cumulative chance of 5\% per day that the chest is irretrievably lost. If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, not even with a wish spell, that the large chest can be summoned back, although an extraplanar expedition might be mounted to find it.

\par The shelter has no heating or cooling source (other than natural insulation qualities). Therefore, it must be heated as a normal dwelling, and extreme heat adversely affects it and its occupants.

\par If the creature in question is not on the same plane of existence as you are, there is a 5\% chance that the sending does not arrive. (Local conditions on other planes may worsen this chance considerably.)

\begin{spelleffect}
You cause a small symbol to appear in the text of a written work. The text containing the symbol must be at least 25 words long. When anyone reads the text containing the symbol, the sepia snake sigil springs into being, transforming into a large sepia serpent that strikes at the reader, provided there is line of effect between the symbol and the reader.
\par Simply seeing the enspelled text is not sufficient to trigger the spell; the subject must deliberately read it. The target is entitled to a save to evade the snake's strike. If it succeeds, the sepia snake dissipates in a flash of brown light accompanied by a puff of dun-colored smoke and a loud noise. If the target fails its save, it is engulfed in a shimmering amber field of force and immobilized until released, either at your command or when 1d4 days \add 1 day per caster level have elapsed.
\par While trapped in the amber field of force, the subject does not age, breathe, grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells. It is preserved in a state of suspended animation, unaware of its surroundings. It can be damaged by outside forces (and perhaps even killed), since the field provides no protection against physical injury. However, a dying subject does not lose hit points or become stable until the spell ends.
\par The hidden sigil cannot be detected by normal observation, and detect magic reveals only that the entire text is magical.
\par A dispel magic can remove the sigil. An erase spell destroys the entire page of text.
\par Sepia snake sigil can be cast in combination with other spells that hide or garble text, such as secret page.

Creatures affected by sequester become comatose and are effectively in a state of suspended animation until the spell wears off or is dispelled.

\begin{spelleffect}
To use the shadow walk spell, you must be in an area of shadowy illumination. You and any creature you touch are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow. The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real. You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must be touching each other.
\par In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane. Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane.
\par Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can't make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end. It's impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying. Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10\mtimes 100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10\mtimes 1,000 feet in the same direction. If this would still place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued (no save).
\par Shadow walk can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this usage requires the transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality. The transit of the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4 hours.
\par Any creatures touched by you when shadow walk is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Plane of Shadow.
\par They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50\% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you). Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of Shadow receive a Will saving throw, negating the effect if successful.

\begin{spelleffect}
This spell enables you to make a snare that functions as a magic trap. The snare can be made from any supple vine, a thong, or a rope. When you cast snare upon it, the cordlike object blends with its surroundings (Search DC 23 to locate). One end of the snare is tied in a loop that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside the circle.
\par If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare can be fastened to it. The spell causes the tree to bend and then straighten when the loop is triggered, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped and lifting it off the ground by the trapped limb or limbs. If no such tree is available, the cordlike object tightens around the creature, dealing no damage but causing it to be entangled.
\par The snare is magical. To escape, a trapped creature must make a DC 23 Escape Artist check or a DC 23 Strength check that is a full-round action. The snare has AC 7 and 5 hit points. A successful escape from the snare breaks the loop and ends the spell.

\begin{spelleffect}
You grant the semblance of life and intellect to a corpse, allowing it to answer several questions that you put to it. You may ask one question per two caster levels. Unasked questions are wasted if the duration expires. The corpse's knowledge is limited to what the creature knew during life, including the languages it spoke (if any). Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive. If the creature's alignment was different from yours, the corpse gets a Will save to resist the spell as if it were alive.
\par If the corpse has been subject to speak with dead within the past week, the new spell fails. You can cast this spell on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the body must be mostly intact to be able to respond. A damaged corpse may be able to give partial answers or partially correct answers, but it must at least have a mouth in order to speak at all.
\par This spell does not let you actually speak to the person (whose soul has departed). It instead draws on the imprinted knowledge stored in the corpse. The partially animated body retains the imprint of the soul that once inhabited it, and thus it can speak with all the knowledge that the creature had while alive. The corpse, however, cannot learn new information.
\par Indeed, it can't even remember being questioned.

\spellrng{0 ft.; see text}
\spelleff{One symbol}
\spelldur{See text}
\spellsave{Fortitude negates}
\spellsr{Yes}
\begin{spelleffect}
This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface. When triggered, a symbol of death slays one or more creatures within a \arealarge radius burst of the symbol whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The symbol of death affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the symbol becomes active and glows, lasting for one hour or until it has affected 150 hit points' worth of creatures, whichever comes first. Any creature that enters the area while the symbol of death is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the symbol only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save again.
\par Until it is triggered, the symbol of death is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a symbol of death must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the symbol of death ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the symbol of death works normally.
\par As a default, a symbol of death is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 50 feet from a symbol of death can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a symbol of death's triggering conditions cannot be changed.
\par In this case, ``reading" the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a symbol of death to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can't use a symbol of death offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol of death is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a symbol of death cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.
\par You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a symbol of death can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Values, and hit points don't qualify.
\par When scribing a symbol of death, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the effect. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the creature remains within 50 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.
\par You also can attune any number of creatures to the symbol of death, but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as ten creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as twenty-five creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer. Any creature attuned to a symbol of death cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own symbols of death, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.
\par Read magic allows you to identify a symbol of death with a DC 18 Spellcraft check. Of course, if the symbol of death is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.
\par A symbol of death can be removed by a successful dispel magic targeted solely on the rune. An erase spell has no effect on a symbol of death. Destruction of the surface where a symbol of death is inscribed destroys the symbol but also triggers it.
\par Symbol of death can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent symbol of death that is disabled or that has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.
\par Note: Magic traps such as symbol of death can be detected and disabled with the Search and Disable Device skills. The DC in each case is 25 \add spell level, or 33 for symbol of death.

This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles away. Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent (see below) per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance.
\par After completing the spell, you and anyone bring with you can't take any actions until the next turn that each creature would have.
\par You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.
\par To see how well the teleportation works, roll d\% and consult the Teleport table. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.
\par \subspell{Familiarity} ``Very familiar" is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. ``Studied carefully" is a place you know well, either because you can currently see it, you've been there often, or you have used other means (such as scrying) to study the place for at least one hour. ``Seen casually" is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. ``Viewed once" is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic.
\par ``False destination" is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20\plus80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d\%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.
\par \subspell{On Target} You appear where you want to be.
\par \subspell{Off Target} You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10\mult1d10\% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly
\par Similar \spellarea{You wind up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area.}
\par Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell's range, the spell simply fails instead.
\par Mishap: You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten ``scrambled." You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20\plus80. Each time ``Mishap" comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.

You create an unmoving, opaque sphere of force of any color you desire around yourself. Half the sphere projects above the ground, and the lower hemisphere passes through the ground. As many as nine other Medium creatures can fit into the field with you; they can freely pass into and out of the hut without harming it. However, if you remove yourself from the hut, the spell ends.
\par The temperature inside the hut is 70 F if the exterior temperature is between 0\degree and 100\degree F. An exterior temperature below 0\degree or above 100\degree lowers or raises the interior temperature on a 1-degree-for-1 basis. The hut also provides protection against the elements, such as rain, dust, and sandstorms. The hut withstands any wind of less than hurricane force, but a hurricane (75\add mph wind speed) or greater force destroys it.
\par The interior of the hut is a hemisphere. You can illuminate it dimly upon command or extinguish the light as desired. Although the force field is opaque from the outside, it is transparent from within. Missiles, weapons, and most spell effects can pass through the hut without affecting it, although the occupants cannot be seen from outside the hut (they have total concealment).

\spellsave{None}
\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
You can enter any normal plant (Medium or larger) and pass any distance to a plant of the same kind in a single round, regardless of the distance separating the two. The entry plant must be alive. The destination plant need not be familiar to you, but it also must be alive. If you are uncertain of the location of a particular kind of destination plant, you need merely designate direction and distance and the transport via plants spell moves you as close as possible to the desired location. If a particular destination plant is desired but the plant is not living, the spell fails and you are ejected from the entry plant.
\par After completing the spell, you and anyone bring with you can't take any actions until the next turn that each creature would have.
\par You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. Use the following equivalents to determine the maximum number of larger creatures you can bring along: A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you.
\par You can't use this spell to travel through plant creatures.
\par The destruction of an occupied plant slays you and any creatures you have brought along, and ejects the bodies and all carried objects from the tree.

\spelldur{Permanent; see text}
\spellsave{None}
\spellsr{Yes; see text}
\begin{spelleffect}
Trap the soul forces a creature's life force (and its material body) into a gem. The gem holds the trapped entity indefinitely or until the gem is broken and the life force is released, which allows the material body to reform. If the trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is broken.
\par In addition to the gem, a trigger object must be used. It must be inscribed with the creature's name. A sympathy ritual can also be placed on the trigger object. As soon as the subject picks up or accepts the trigger object, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem without the benefit of a save, though spell resistance applies normally. Any other creature who picks up the object is unaffected, though magical inspection can reveal the existence of the trap.
\spellmat{Before the actual casting of \spell{trap the soul}, you must procure a gem of at least 1,000 gp value for every Hit Value possessed by the creature to be trapped. If the gem is not valuable enough, it shatters when the entrapment is attempted. (While creatures have no concept of level or Hit Values as such, the value of the gem needed to trap an individual can be researched. Remember that this value can change over time as creatures gain more Hit Values.)}
\par Focus: A special trigger object, prepared as described above, is needed.

\begin{spelleffect}
You gain the ability to enter trees and move from inside one tree to inside another tree. The first tree you enter and all others you enter must be of the same kind, must be living, and must have girth at least equal to yours. By moving into an oak tree (for example), you instantly know the location of all other oak trees within transport range (see below) and may choose whether you want to pass into one or simply step back out of the tree you moved into. You may choose to pass to any tree of the appropriate kind within the transport range as shown on the following table.
\begin{dtable}
\begin{tabularx}{\columnwidth}{>{\lcol}X >{\lcol}X}
Type of Tree & Transport Range \\
Oak, ash, yew & 3,000 feet \\
Elm, linden & 2,000 feet \\
Other deciduous & 1,500 feet \\
Any coniferous & 1,000 feet \\
All other trees & 500 feet
\end{tabularx}
\end{dtable}
\par You may move into a tree up to one time per caster level (passing from one tree to another counts only as moving into one tree). The spell lasts until the duration expires or you exit a tree. Each transport is a full-round action.
\par You can, at your option, remain within a tree without transporting yourself, but you are forced out when the spell ends. If the tree in which you are concealed is chopped down or burned, you are slain if you do not exit before the process is complete.

\begin{spelleffect}
This spell functions like raise dead, except that you can resurrect a creature that has been dead for as long as 10 years per caster level. This spell can even bring back creatures whose bodies have been destroyed, provided that you unambiguously identify the deceased in some fashion (reciting the deceased's time and place of birth or death is the most common method).
\par Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no negative levels, constitution drain, or loss of prepared spells.
\par You can revive someone killed by a death effect or someone who has been turned into an undead creature and then destroyed. This spell can also resurrect elementals or outsiders, but it can't resurrect constructs or undead creatures.
\par Even true resurrection can't restore to life a creature who has died of old age.
\spellmat{A sprinkle of holy (or unholy) water and diamonds worth a total of at least 25,000 gp.}

\spellsr{See text}
\begin{spelleffect}
Unhallow makes a particular site, building, or structure an unholy site. This has three major effects.
\par First, the site or structure is guarded by a magic circle against good effect.
\par Second, all turning checks made to turn undead take a \minus4 penalty to turning level, and turning checks to rebuke undead gain a \plus4 bonus to turning level. Spell resistance does not apply to this effect.
\par Finally, you may choose to fix a single spell effect to the unhallowed site. The spell effect lasts for one year and functions throughout the entire site, regardless of its normal duration and area or effect. You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that share your faith or alignment, or creatures that adhere to another faith or alignment. At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting unhallow again.
\par Spell effects that may be tied to an unhallowed site include aid, bane, bless, cause fear, darkness, daylight, death ward, deeper darkness, detect magic, detect good, dimensional anchor, discern lies, dispel magic, endure elements, freedom of movement, invisibility purge, protection from energy, remove fear, resist energy, silence, tongues, and zone of truth.
\par Saving throws and spell resistance might apply to these spells' effects. (See the individual spell descriptions for details.)
\par An area can receive only one unhallow spell (and its associated spell effect) at a time.
\par Unhallow counters but does not dispel hallow.
\spellmat{Herbs, oils, and incense worth at least 1,000 gp, plus 1,000 gp per level of the spell to be tied to the unhallowed area.}

\spellsave{None}
\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
An unseen servant is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command. It can run and fetch things, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as clean and mend. The servant can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity over and over again if told to do so as long as you remain within range. It can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, and the like. It has an effective Strength score of 2 (so it can lift 20 pounds or drag 100 pounds). It can trigger traps and such, but it can exert only 20 pounds of force, which is not enough to activate certain pressure plates and other devices. It can't perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a check using a skill that can't be used untrained. Its speed is 15 feet.
\par The servant cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll. It cannot be killed, but it dissipates if it takes 6 points of damage from area attacks. (It gets no saves against attacks.) If you attempt to send it beyond the spell's range (measured from your current position), the servant ceases to exist.

\spellskill{Local}
\spelllvl{Arcane 7}
\spelltime{1 minute}
\begin{spelleffect}
This ritual functions like legend lore, except that it works more quickly but produces some strain on you. You pose a question about some person, place, or object, then cast the spell. If the person or object is at hand or if you are in the place in question, you receive a vision about it by succeeding on a caster level check (1d20 \plus1 per caster level; maximum \plus25) against DC 20. If only detailed information on the person, place, or object is known, the DC is 25, and the information gained is incomplete. If only rumors are known, the DC is 30, and the information gained is vague. After the spell is complete, you are exhausted.
\par If you cast this spell while fatigued or exhausted, you must make a Fortitude save (DC 15 if fatigued or DC 20 if exhausted) or immediately fall unconscious for an hour.

\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
You send a message or sound on the wind to a designated spot. The whispering wind travels to a specific location within range that is familiar to you, provided that it can find a way to the location. A whispering wind is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches the location. It then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other sound. Note that the message is delivered regardless of whether anyone is present to hear it. The wind then dissipates.
\par You can prepare the spell to bear a message of no more than twenty-five words, cause the spell to deliver other sounds for 1 round, or merely have the whispering wind seem to be a faint stirring of the air. You can likewise cause the whispering wind to move as slowly as 1 mile per hour or as quickly as 1 mile per 10 minutes.
\par When the wind reaches its objective, it swirls and remains in place until the message is delivered. As with magic mouth, whispering wind cannot speak verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects.

\par You alter the substance of your body to a cloudlike vapor (as the gaseous form spell) and move through the air, possibly at great speed. You can take other creatures with you, each of which acts independently.
\par Normally, a wind walker flies at a speed of 10 feet with perfect maneuverability. If desired by the subject, a magical wind wafts a wind walker along at up to 600 feet per round (60 mph) with poor maneuverability. Wind walkers are not invisible but rather appear misty and translucent. If fully clothed in white, they are 80\% likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, or the like.
\par A wind walker can regain its physical form as desired and later resume the cloud form. Each change to and from vaporous form takes 5 rounds, which counts toward the duration of the ritual (as does any time spent in physical form). As noted above, you can dismiss the ritual, and you can even dismiss it for individual wind walkers and not others.
\par For the last minute of the ritual's duration, a wind walker in cloud form automatically descends 60 feet per round (for a total of 600 feet), though it may descend faster if it wishes. This descent serves as a warning that the ritual is about to end.
