\spellspecial When you perform this ritual, you choose whether to create an audible or mental alarm. You may also designate a password.
\spellline
\begin{spelltrigger}{A creature (Tiny or larger) enters the area without speaking the password}
    \spelleffect[Audible Alarm] The sound of a hand bell rings in the area. It is typically clearly identifiable up to 100 feet away, and audible up to 500 feet away.
    \spelleffect[Mental Alarm] You receive a single mental ``ping''. This awakens you from normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb concentration.
\end{spelltrigger}
\spellnotes A \spell{silence} spell or similar effect can prevent an audible alarm from being heard. This ritual can be made permanent with a \spell{permanency} ritual.

\spellinfo{Divination (Knowledge)}{Arcane}
\spelltime{1 minute}

\spellsection{Animate Dead}{3}
\spelldesc{You bind a fragment of a dead creature's soul to its corpse, reanimating it as an undead skeleton or zombie.}
\spellinfo{Necromancy (Soul, Vitalism) [Evil, Negative]}{Arcane, Divine}
\spelltime{1 minute}
\spellrng{Touch}
\begin{spelltarget}{One or more corpses}
    \spellspecial The combined levels of all targets cannot exceed your caster level.
    \spelleffect The target becomes an undead creature that obeys your spoken commands. You choose whether to create a skeleton or a zombie. Creating a zombie require a mostly intact corpse, including most of the flesh. Creating a skeleton only requires a mostly intact skeleton. If a skeleton is made from an intact corpse, the flesh quickly falls off the animated bones.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this ritual, however, you can control only 4 levels worth of undead creatures per caster level. If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control, and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled. You choose which creatures are released.

Once destroyed, an undead creature never be animated again, even if the corpse is intact.

\spellsection{Animal Messenger}{2}
\spelldesc{You compel a Tiny animal to go to a spot you designate.}
\spellinfo{Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]}{Arcane, Nature}
\spelltime{1 minute; see text}
\spellrng{\rnglong}
\spelldur{One week}
\spellsr{Yes}
\begin{spelltarget}{One Tiny animal}
    \spelleffect As soon as you begin performing this ritual, the target animal approaches you and awaits your bidding. You can mentally impress on the animal a certain place well known to you or an obvious landmark. The directions must be simple, because the animal depends on your knowledge and can't find a destination on its own. During the casting of the ritual, you can attach some small item or note to the messenger. The animal then goes to the designated location and waits there, straying only to gather food and water as necessary, until the duration of the ritual expires. During this period of waiting, the messenger allows others to approach it and remove any scroll or token it carries.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes The most common use for this ritual is to get an animal to carry a message to your allies. The animal cannot be one tamed or trained by someone else.

\begin{spelltargets}{All creatures in the area of the chosen alignment or type}l[Magic vs. Will]
    \spelleffect The target takes a \minus4 penalty to attacks, saves, and checks as long as it remains in the area.
    \spellsuccess The target leaves the area as soon as physically possible, using any means necessary. It will not willingly return to the area as long as the spell is in effect.
    \spellfailure The target feels a desire to leave the area, though it is not compelled to act on that desire immediately.

\spellinfo{Divination (Scrying)}{Arcane}
\spelltime{1 minute}
\spellrng{\rngmed}
\spelldur{\durlong \dismissable}
\spellline
\spelleffect This ritual creates a magic sensor. As a standard action, you can concentrate to see through the sensor as if you were in its location. While concentrating, you can move the sensor up to 30 feet per round in any direction.

You can freely control and see through the sensor even if it moves beyond the spell's range, or out of your line of effect.
\spellnotes \sensorspellnotes

\spellsection{Arcane Lock}{2}
\spellinfo{Abjuration/Transmutation (Alteration, Warding)}{Arcane}
\spelltime{1 minute}
\spellrng{Touch}
\spelldur{Permanent}
\begin{spelltarget}{One closable object, such as a door or box (Large or smaller)}
\spelleffect The target object is magically locked. It can be unlocked with a Devices check against a DC equal to 30 \add your caster level. The DC to break it open forcibly increases by 10.

You can freely pass your own \ritual{arcane lock}, as if the object were not locked.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes A \ritual{knock} spell suppresses the effect for 10 minutes, but does not dispel the \spell{arcane lock}.
\ritualcost*{2}

\spellsection{Arcane Mark}{1}
\spelldesc{You inscribe your personal sigil on a creature or object.}
\spellinfo{Universal}{Arcane}
\spelltime{1 minute}
\spellrng{\rngtouch}
\spelldur{Permanent}
\spellspecial When you learn this ritual, choose a personal rune or mark. It can consist of no more than six characters, and must fit within one square foot.
\begin{spelltarget}{One creature or object}
    \spelleffect Your personal rune or mark is written on the target. The target is not harmed by the writing. You can choose whether the writing will be visible or invisible.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes If an \spell{arcane mark} is placed on a creature, normal wear gradually causes the effect to fade in about a month. You must place your mark on an object before \spell{instant summons} can be cast on it.
\ritualcost*{1}

\spellsection{Atonement}{5}
\spellinfo{Evocation (Channeling)}{Divine, Nature}
\spelltime{1 hour}
\spellrng{Touch}
\spellsr{Yes}
\begin{spelltarget}{One creature}
    \spelleffect If the target has been punished for a significant transgression against its alignment, deity, or organization, this ritual can undo that punishment. The exact effects of this atonement depend on the nature of the punishment the creature is suffering.

    The cost of the ritual depends on the circumstances of the act that provoked the punishment. If the creature's act was unintentional, or under magical influence, no material components are required. If the creature's act was intentional, but the creature seeks atonement intentionally, the normal cost must be paid. If the creature's act was intentional, and the creature does not seek atonement willingly, the material component cost is doubled.
\end{spelltarget}
\ritualcost{5}

\spellsection{Augury}{2}
\spellinfo{Divination (Knowledge)}{Divine}
\spelltime{1 minute}
\spellspecial When you perform this ritual, you state an action that a creature (or group of creatures) could take.
\spelleffect You learn whether a particular action is likely to bring good or bad results for you in the immediate future. The ritual provides one of four results:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Weal (if the action will probably bring good results).
    \item Woe (for bad results).
    \item Weal and woe (for both).
    \item No response (for actions that don't have especially good or bad results).
\end{itemize}

This ritual does not describe the future with certainty. It describes which result is most probable. The more unambiguous the action's effects, the more likely the ritual is to be correct.
\spellnotes This ritual can only foresee events roughly half an hour into the future. Thus, the result might not take into account the long-term consequences of an action.

\spellsection{Awaken}{7}

\spelltime{24 hours}
\spellrng{Touch}

\spellsr{Yes}
\begin{spelltarget}{One pint of water}
    \spelleffect The target becomes holy water. Large bodies of water can be made holy by performing this ritual multiple times.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes Holy water can be thrown as a splash weapon, dealing 2d4 points of damage to a struck undead creature or an evil outsider.

\spellsection{Break Enchantment}{5}
\spellinfo{Abjuration (Negation) [Magic]}{Arcane, Divine}
\spelltime{1 minute}
\spellrng{\rngclose}
\begin{spelltarget}{One creature or object}[Caster level vs. Special]
    \spelleffect Magical effects on the target are dispelled, as a targeted \spell{dispel magic}. This ritual can also remove effects that are immune to \spell{dispel magic}, such as curses, if they are 6th level or lower.
\end{spelltarget}
\par If the effect comes from some permanent magic item, \ritual{break enchantment} does not remove the curse from the item, but it does frees the victim from the item's effects.
\ritualcost{5}

\spellsection{Clairaudience/Clairvoyance}{3}
\spellinfo{Divination (Scrying)}{Arcane, Divine}
\spelltime{1 minute}
\spellrng{\rngext \rngunrestricted}
\spelldur{\durmed \dismissable}
\spellline
\spelleffect This ritual creates a magic sensor. You don't need line of sight or line of effect to create the sensor, but the destination must be known -- a place familiar to you or an obvious one. As a standard action, you can concentrate to see and hear through the sensor as if you were in its location. While concentrating, you can rotate the sensor to see and hear in any direction.
\spellnotes \sensorspellnotes
\ritualcost*{3}

\spellsection{Clone}{7}
\spellinfo{Conjuration (Creation)}{Arcane}
\spelltime{24 hours}
\spellrng{Touch}
\spelleffect This ritual creates an inert duplicate of a creature. The duplicate body is identical to the creature's original body, but it has no soul, and rots if not preserved. It can be used in place of the creature's original body for the purpose of spells and effects which animate or raise the dead, such as \spell{animate dead} or \spell{raise dead} (see \pcref{Bringing Back the Dead}).
\ritualcost{7}[in ritual components, and a piece of flesh (not hair, nails, scales, or the like) with a volume of at least 1 cubic inch that was taken from the original creature's living body. The piece of flesh need not be fresh, but it must be kept from rotting.]

\spellsection{Commune}{5}
\spellinfo{Divination (Communication) [Planar]}{Divine}
\spelltime{10 minutes}
\spelldur{\durmed or until expended}
\spellline
\spelleffect You contact your deity -- or agents thereof -- and ask questions that can be answered by a simple yes or no. You are allowed one such question per caster level. The answers given are correct within the limits of the entity's knowledge. ``Unclear'' is a legitimate answer, because powerful beings of the Outer Planes are not necessarily omniscient. In cases where a one-word answer would be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, a short phrase (five words or less) may be given as an answer instead.
\spellnotes A cleric without a deity contacts a philosophically aligned deity.
\ritualcost*{5}

\spellsection{Commune with Nature}{5}
\spelldesc{You become one with nature, attaining knowledge of the surrounding territory.}
\spellinfo{Divination (Knowledge)}{Nature}
\spelltime{10 minutes}
\spellrng{10 miles or 1,000 feet; see text}
\spellline
\spelleffect You instantly gain knowledge of as many as three facts from among the following subjects: the ground or terrain, plants, minerals, bodies of water, people, general animal population, presence of woodland creatures, presence of powerful unnatural creatures, or even the general state of the natural setting.
\par In outdoor settings, the ritual operates in a 10 mile radius. In natural underground settings -- caves, caverns, and the like -- the radius is limited to 1,000 feet.
\spellnotes The ritual does not function where nature has been replaced by construction or settlement, such as in dungeons and towns.
\ritualcost*{5}

\spellsection{Comprehend Languages}{2}
\spelldesc{You can understand any language.}
\spellinfo{Divination (Communication)}{Arcane, Divine, Nature}
\spelltime{1 minute}
\spelldur{\durlong}
\begin{spelltarget}{You}
    \spelleffect You gain the ability to understand any language. This does not grant you any additional ability to speak or write in other languages.
\end{spelltarget}
\spellnotes This ritual can be foiled by certain obscuring magic (such as the \spell{secret page} and \spell{illusory script} rituals). It does not decipher codes or reveal messages concealed in otherwise normal text. You may be unable to understand dead or extremely obscure languages.

This ritual can be made permanent with a \spell{permanency} ritual.
\ritualcost{2}

\spellsection{Consecrate}{2}
\spelldesc{You bless an area with holy power, disrupting undead.}

\spellsection{Contact Other Plane}{5}
\spellinfo{Divination (Knowledge) [Planar]}{Arcane}
\spelltime{10 minutes}
\spelldur{\durmed or until expended}
\spelleffect You send your mind to another plane of existence (an Elemental Plane or some plane farther removed) in order to receive advice and information from powers there. You are allowed one such question per caster level. The answers given are correct within the limits of the entity's knowledge. ``Unclear" is a legitimate answer, because even powerful beings of other planes are not necessarily omniscient. In cases where a one-word answer would be misleading or contrary to the entity's interests, a short phrase (five words or less) may be given as an answer instead.
\ritualcost{5}

\spellsection{Contagion}{3}
\spelldesc{You infect your foe with a contagious disease.}
\spellinfo{Necromancy (Flesh)}{Arcane, Divine, Nature}
\spelltime{10 minutes}
\spellrng{10 miles \rngunrestricted}
\spellsr{Yes}
\begin{spelltarget}{One creature}[Magic vs. Fortitude]
    \spellsuccess The target contracts a disease selected from the table below, which strikes immediately (no incubation period). The disease's attack bonus for the initial and subsequent incubation periods is equal to your magic attack bonus.
\begin{dtable}
    \begin{tabularx}{\columnwidth}{l X}
        \thead{Disease} & \thead{Damage} \\

        Slimy doom & 1d6 Con
    \end{tabularx}
    1 Each time a victim takes 3 or more Strength damage from blinding sickness, he or she must make another Fortitude save or be permanently blinded.	 
\end{dtable}

\end{spelltarget}
\ritualcost{3}[in ritual components, and one ounce of fresh flesh or blood that belongs to the target. In general, blood is not considered ``fresh'' after one hour, while flesh takes up between a day and a week to decay, depending on the conditions.]

\spellsection{Continual Flame}{2}
\spellinfo{Illusion (Figment) [Light]}{Arcane, Divine}
\spelltime{1 minute}
\spellrng{Touch}
\spelldur{Permanent}
\begin{spelltarget}{One object}
\spelleffect The target glows like a torch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn't use oxygen. A \spell{continual flame} can be covered and hidden, but not smothered or quenched.
\end{spelltarget}
\ritualcost{2}

\spellsection{Control Weather}{7}
\spellinfo{Evocation (Control) [Air]}{Arcane, Divine, Nature}
\spelltime{10 minutes; see text}
\spellzone{2 mile radius cylinder centered on you}
\spelldur{\durext}
\spelleffect This ritual changes the weather in the area. The weather begins to form as you perform the ritual. You can call forth weather appropriate to the climate and season of the area you are in. For example, you can normally create a thunderstorm, but not if the season is winter or you are in a desert.
\par You control the general tendencies of the weather, such as the direction and intensity of the wind. You cannot control specific applications of the weather -- where lightning strikes, for example, or the exact path of a tornado.Contradictory conditions are not possible simultaneously.
\spellnotes \spell{Control weather} can do away with atmospheric phenomena (naturally occurring or otherwise) as well as create them.
\ritualcost*{7}

\spellsection{Create Food and Water}{2}
\spellinfo{Conjuration (Creation)}{Arcane, Divine, Nature}
\spelltime{10 minutes}
\spellrng{\rngclose}
\spellline
\spelleffect This ritual creates food and drink. The food is sufficient to sustain three creatures per caster level for 24 hours. The food that this ritual creates is simple fare of your choice -- highly nourishing, if rather bland. You can create food suitable to sustain any kind of creature, if you know what it eats.

Food created by this ritual decays and becomes inedible within 24 hours. The water created by this ritual is just like clean rain water, and does not go bad as the food does.
\spellnotes The food can be kept fresh for another 24 hours by performing a \ritual{purify food and water} ritual on it.
\ritualcost*{2}

\spellsection{Create Water}{1}
\spelldesc{You create water to ease the thirst of you and your companions.}
\spellinfo{Conjuration (Creation) [Water]}{Divine}
\spellrng{\rngclose}
\spelltime{1 minute}
\spelleffect This ritual creates wholesome, drinkable water. It creates 2 gallons per caster level. The water can be created at multiple locations within the ritual's range, allowing you to fill multiple small water containers.
\spellnotes Conjuration spells can't create substances or objects within a creature. Water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon.
\ritualcost*{1}

\spellsection{Create Greater Undead}{8}
\spellinfo{Necromancy (Soul, Vitalism) [Evil, Negative]}{Arcane, Divine}
\spelleffect This ritual functions like \ritual{create undead}, except that you can create more powerful and intelligent sorts of undead: wraiths, spectres, and devourers. The type or types of undead you can create is based on your caster level, as shown on the table below.
\begin{dtable}
    \begin{tabularx}{\columnwidth}{*{2}{>{\lcol}X}}
        Caster Level & Undead Created \\
        16th--17th & Wraith \\
        18th--19th & Spectre \\
        20th or higher & Devourer \\
    \end{tabularx}
\end{dtable}

    \spelleffect The target becomes an undead creature that obeys your spoken commands. You choose whether to create a skeleton or a zombie. Creating a zombie require a mostly intact corpse, including most of the flesh. Creating a skeleton only requires a mostly intact skeleton. If a skeleton is made from an intact corpse, the flesh quickly falls off the animated bones.
    \ritualcost{8}

\spellsection{Create Undead}{5}
\spellinfo{Necromancy (Soul, Vitalism) [Evil, Negative]}{Arcane, Divine}
\spelltime{1 hour}
\spellrng{\rngclose}
\begin{spelltarget}{One intact corpse}
    \spelleffect The target becomes an undead creature that obeys your spoken commands. The type of creature you can create depends on your caster level, as shown on \trefnp{Create Undead}.

\begin{dtable}
    \begin{tabularx}{\columnwidth}{*{2}{>{\lcol}X}}
        \thead{Caster Level} & \thead{Undead Created} \\

        21st or higher & Mohrg \\
    \end{tabularx}

\spellnotes As \spell{animate dead}.
\ritualcost*{5}[in black onyx gems.]

\spellsection{Curse Water}{1}
\spellinfo{Evocation (Channeling) [Evil]}{Divine}
\spelltime{1 minute}
\spelltwocol{\spelltgt{Flask of water touched}}{\spellrng{Touch}}
\spellsr{Yes}
\spellattack{Will negates (object)}
\spelleffect This ritual imbues a flask (1 pint) of water with unholy power, turning it into unholy water.
\spellnotes Unholy water can be thrown as a splash weapon, dealing 2d4 points of damage to a struck good outsider. It functions like holy water in all other respects.
\ritualcost*{1}

\spellsection{Darkness}{2}
\spelldesc{You create a dark aura around an object of your choosing, keeping light without. Even a dwarf's vision is hampered by this shadowy sphere.}
\spellinfo{Illusion (Glamer) [Darkness]}{Arcane, Divine}
\spelltime{1 minute}
\spelltwocol{\spelltgt{Object touched}}{\spellrng{\rngtouch}}
\spelldur{\durlong \dismissable}
\spelleffect This ritual causes an object to radiate shadowy illumination out to a \areamed radius. This causes the level of illumination to drop to shadowy illumination or the current prevailing condition, whichever is lower. Darkvision is ineffective in magical darkness, and confers no advantage over normal vision.
\spellnotes If \spell{darkness} is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a lightproof covering, the spell's effect is blocked until the covering is removed.

Normal lights (torches, candles, lanterns, and so forth) are incapable of brightening the area or shining through it, as are light spells of lower level. Such effects are also suppressed if they originate from within the area of the darkness, preventing them from shining light elsewhere. Higher level light spells are not affected by darkness.
\ritualcost{2}

\spellsection{Demand}{8}
\spellinfo{Divination/Enchantment (Communication, Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]}{Arcane}
\spellsr{Yes}
\spellattack{None/Will negates}
\spelleffect This ritual functions like \ritual{sending}, but the message can also contain a \ritual{suggestion} (see the \ritual{suggestion} spell), which the subject does its best to carry out. A successful Will save negates the \ritual{suggestion} effect but not the contact itself. The \ritual{demand}, if received, is understood even if the subject's Intelligence score is as low as \minus5. If the message is impossible or meaningless according to the circumstances that exist for the subject at the time the demand is issued, the message is understood but the \ritual{suggestion} is ineffective.
\par The demand's message to the creature must be twenty-five words or less, including the \ritual{suggestion}. The creature can also give an equally short reply immediately.
\spellnotes The contact itself is not mind-affecting -- only the \spell{suggestion}.
\ritualcost*{8}

\spellsection{Desecrate}{2}
\spellinfo{Evocation (Channeling) [Evil]}{Divine}
\spelltime{1 minute}
\spelltwocol{\spellzone{\areamed radius}}{\spellrng{\rngclose}}
\spelldur{24 hours}
\spelleffect This ritual imbues an area with unholy power. Every undead creature in a \ritual{desecrated} area gains a \plus2 bonus to physical attacks, checks, and special defenses. An undead creature created within or summoned into such an area gains \plus1 hit points per level.
\ritualcost{2}

\spellsection{Detect Scrying}{4}
\spellinfo{Divination (Awareness) [Magic]}{Arcane}
\spelltime{1 minute}
\spellemanation{\arealarge radius centered on you}
\spelldur{\durext}
\spelleffect You immediately become aware of any attempt to observe you by means of a divination (scrying) spell or effect. The ritual's area radiates from you and moves as you move. You know the location of every magical sensor within the ritual's area.
\par If the scrying attempt originates within the area, you also know its location; otherwise, you and the scrier immediately make opposed caster level checks (1d20 \add caster level). If you at least match the scrier's result, you get a visual image of the scrier and an accurate sense of his or her direction and distance from you.
\ritualcost{4}

\spellsection{Disguise Self}{1}
\spellinfo{Illusion (Glamer) [Unreal]}{Arcane}
\spelltime{1 minute}
\spelltwocol{\spelltgt{You}}{\spellrng{\rngpers}}
\spelldur{\durlong \dismissable}
\spelleffect As part of performing this ritual, you make a Disguise check. You gain a \plus10 enhancement bonus on the check, and you can freely alter the appearance of your clothes and equipment, regardless of their original form.
\spellnotes A creature that interacts with the effect gets a Will save to recognize it as an illusion. A creature that recognizes the effect as an illusion automatically sees through the disguise unless you are also disguised through non-illusory means, in which case it must beat that Disguise check as normal.
\ritualcost*{1}

\spellsectioncomma{Disguise Self}{Greater}{3}
\spellinfo{Illusion (Glamer) [Unreal]}{Arcane}
\spelltime{10 minutes}
\spelldur{\durext \dismissable}
\spelleffect This ritual functions like \spell{disguise self}, except that it lasts longer and you can change the disguise at will. By concentrating on the effect as a standard action, you can take on an entirely new appearance, just as if you had performed the \spell{disguise self} ritual again.
\ritualcost{3}

\spellsection{Discern Location}{8}
\spellinfo{Divination (Knowledge)}{Arcane, Divine, Nature}
\spelltime{10 minutes}
\spelltwocol{\spelltgt{One creature or object}}{\spellrng{Unlimited}}
\spelleffect This ritual reveals the name of a chosen creature or object's location (place, name, business name, building name, or the like), community, county (or similar political division), country, continent, and the plane of existence where the target lies. \spell{Discern location} circumvents normal means of protection from scrying or location; nothing short of a \spell{mind blank} spell or the direct intervention of a deity prevents you from learning the information.
\par To find a creature with the ritual, you must have seen the creature or have some item that once belonged to it. To find an object, you must have touched it at least once.
\ritualcost{8}

\spellsection{Dimensional Lock}{5}
\spelldesc{You create a shimmering emerald field that completely blocks extradimensional travel.}
\spellinfo{Abjuration (Negation)}{Arcane, Divine}
\spelltime{10 minutes}
\spelltwocol{\spellzone{\arealarge radius}}{\spellrng{\rngmed}}
\spelldur{Thirty days}
\spellsr{Yes}
\spelleffect Extradimensional travel into or out of the spell's area is impossible. All Conjuration (Translocation) and Conjuration (Summoning) effects are prohibited, as well as \spell{astral projection} and similar spell-like or psionic abilities.
\spellnotes \par A \spell{dimensional lock} does not interfere with the movement of creatures already in ethereal or astral form when the ritual is finished, nor does it block extradimensional perception or attack forms. Also, the spell does not prevent summoned creatures from disappearing at the end of a summoning spell.
\ritualcost*{5}

\spellsection{Divination}{4}
\spellinfo{Divination (Knowledge)}{Divine}
\spelltime{10 minutes}
\spelltwocol{\spelltgt{You}}{\spellrng{Personal}}
\spelleffect Similar to \spell{augury} but more powerful, a \spell{divination} spell can provide you with a useful piece of advice in reply to a question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within one week. The advice can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. If your party doesn't act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful. The base chance for a correct divination is 70\% \add 1\% per caster level. If the dice roll fails, you know the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is at work.
\spellnotes \par As with \spell{augury}, multiple divinations about the same topic by the same caster use the same dice result as the first divination spell and yield the same answer each time.

\spelldur{See text}
\spellsr{Yes}
\spelleffect You, or a messenger touched by you, sends a phantasmal message to others in the form of a dream. At the beginning of the spell, you must name the recipient or identify him or her by some title that leaves no doubt as to identity. The messenger then enters a trance, appears in the intended recipient's dream, and delivers the message. The message can be of any length, and the recipient remembers it perfectly upon waking. The communication is one-way. The recipient cannot ask questions or offer information, nor can the messenger gain any information by observing the dreams of the recipient.
\par Once the message is delivered, the messenger's mind returns instantly to its body. The duration of the spell is the time required for the messenger to enter the recipient's dream and deliver the message.
\par If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, the messenger can choose to wake up (ending the spell) or remain in the trance. The messenger can remain in the trance until the recipient goes to sleep, then enter the recipient's dream and deliver the message as normal. A messenger that is disturbed during the trance comes awake, ending the spell. The messenger is unaware of its own surroundings or of the activities around it while in the trance. It is defenseless both physically and mentally (always fails any saving throw) while in the trance.
\spellnotes Creatures who don't sleep (such as elves, but not half-elves) or don't dream cannot be contacted by this ritual.

Nonmagical writing is automatically erased. To erase magical writing, you must succeed on a caster level check against a DC of 11 \add the caster level of the magic. 
\spellnotes With this spell, you can remove \spell{explosive runes}, a \spell{glyph of warding}, a \spell{sepia snake sigil}, or an \spell{arcane mark}, but not \spell{illusory script} or a \spellindirect{symbol of death}{symbol} spell.

\par You and any characters you specifically instruct can read the protected writing without triggering the runes. Likewise, you can remove the runes whenever desired. Another creature can remove them with a successful \spell{dispel magic} or \spell{erase} spell, but attempting to dispel or erase the runes and failing to do so triggers the explosion.

If you work with a mineral, the target is reduced to 10 cubic feet instead of 100 cubic feet.
\par You must make an appropriate Craft check to fabricate articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship, such as armor, or an appropriate Engineering check to fabricate objects requiring complex engineering, such as a ballista.

\spelleffect The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specified destination, be it the way into or out of a locale. The locale can be outdoors, underground, or even inside a \spell{maze} spell. Find the path works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures at a locale. The location must be on the same plane as you are at the time of casting.
\par The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will eventually lead it to its destination, indicating at appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions to take. For example, the spell enables the subject to sense trip wires or the proper word to bypass a \spell{glyph of warding}. The spell ends when the destination is reached or the duration expires, whichever comes first. Find the path can be used to remove the subject and its companions from the effect of a maze spell in a single round.

\par You can use the trapped object without discharging the trap, as can any individual to whom the object was specifically attuned when cast. Attuning a fire trapped object to an individual usually involves setting a password that you can share.
\spellnotes A \spell{knock} spell does not bypass a \spell{fire trap}. An unsuccessful \spell{dispel magic} spell does not detonate the spell. Underwater, this ward deals half damage and creates a large cloud of steam.

It can hold 100 pounds of weight per caster level. (If used to transport a liquid, its capacity is 2 gallons.) The disk floats approximately 3 feet above the ground at all times and remains level. It floats along horizontally within spell range and will accompany you at a rate of no more than your normal speed each round. If possible, it maintains a constant interval of 5 feet between itself and you. The disk winks out of existence when the spell duration expires.

\spelleffect This spell seals an area against all planar travel into or within it. This includes all Teleportation (Translocation) spells (such as \spell{dimension door} and \spell{teleport}), plane shifting, astral travel, ethereal travel, and all summoning spells. Such effects simply fail automatically.
\par In addition, it damages entering creatures whose alignments are different from yours. The effect on those attempting to enter the warded area is based on their alignment relative to yours (see below). A creature inside the area when the spell is cast takes no damage unless it exits the area and attempts to reenter, at which time it is affected as normal.
\par \subspell{Alignments identical} No effect. The creature may enter the area freely (although not by planar travel).
\par \subspell{Alignments different with respect to either law/chaos or good/evil} The creature takes 8d6 points of damage. A successful Will save halves the damage, and spell resistance applies.
\par \subspell{Alignments different with respect to both law/chaos and good/evil} The creature takes 8d8 points of damage. A successful Will save halves the damage, and spell resistance applies.
\par At your option, the abjuration can include a password, in which case creatures of alignments different from yours can avoid the damage by speaking the password as they enter the area. You must select this option (and the password) at the time of casting.
\spellnotes \par Dispel magic does not dispel a forbiddance effect unless the dispeller's level is at least as high as your caster level. A successful dispel attempt only affects one 60-foot cube.
\par You can't have multiple overlapping forbiddance effects. In such a case, the more recent effect stops at the boundary of the older effect.
\spellmat{A sprinkling of holy water (or unholy water) and rare incenses worth at least 500 gp, plus 500 gp per 60-foot cube. If a password is desired, this requires the burning of additional rare incenses worth at least 250 gp, plus 250 gp per 60-foot cube.}

\spelleffect This spell creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction.
\par The gate itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster's choice), oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.
\par A \spell{gate} has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the gate from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.
\par A \spell{gate} spell functions much like a \spell{plane shift} spell, except that the gate opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a gate from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you -- anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A gate cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.
\par You may hold the \spell{gate} open only for a brief time (no more than 5 rounds), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.

\spellsr{Yes}
\spelleffect The subject must carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by you. The creature must be able to understand you. While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.

The geased creature must follow the given instructions for at least 12 hours a day until the geas is completed, no matter how long it takes. If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions, the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one week. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions.
\par If the subject is prevented from completing its task for 24 hours, it takes a \minus2 penalty to all attribute scores. Each day, another \minus2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of \minus8. No attribute score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The attribute score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the geas.
\spellnotes \par A \spell{remove curse} spell ends a geas/quest spell only if its caster level is higher than the caster level of the \spell{geas/quest} spell. \spellindirect{break enchantment}{Break enchantment} does not end a \spell{geas/quest}, but \spell{limited wish}, \spell{miracle}, and \spell{wish} do.

A glyph of warding can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on. You set the conditions of the ward. The glyph can be triggered by anything within the area that a normal human could observe and react to.
\par Depending on the version selected, a glyph either blasts the intruder or activates a spell.
\par \subspell{Blast Glyph} A blast glyph deals damage to everything in \areasmall radius burst of the intruder. A succcessful Reflex save halves the damage.
\par \subspell{Spell Glyph} You can store any harmful spell of 3rd level or lower that you know into the glyph. An intruder that activates the glyph is the target of the spell or the center of the spell's effect, as appropriate. If the spell summons creatures, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack. Saving throws and spell resistance operate as normal for the stored spell. Only spells with of close range or greater can be stored in a \spell{glyph of warding}.
\spellnotes \par A \spell{glyph of warding} cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though it can be dispelled. \spellindirect{read magic}{Read magic} allows you to identify a glyph of warding with a DC 13 Spellcraft check. Identifying the glyph does not discharge it and allows you to learn which type of glyph is used, though not which spell is stored (if any).
\par Magic traps such as \spell{glyph of warding} can be detected with the Perception skill and disabled with the Devices skill. The DC is 25 \add spell level, or DC 28 for \spell{glyph of warding}. No more than one magic trap can be placed on the same object or in the same area.

The spell effect lasts for one year and functions throughout the entire site, regardless of the normal duration and area or effect. You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures who share your faith or alignment, or creatures who adhere to another faith or alignment. At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting \spell{hallow} again.

\par The item can be summoned from another plane, but only if no other creature has claimed ownership of it.

\spelleffect This ritual brings to your mind legends about an important person, place, or thing. If the person or thing is at hand, or if you are in the place in question, the casting time is only 1d4\mtimes10 minutes. If you have only detailed information on the person, place, or thing, the casting time is 1d10 days, and the resulting lore is less complete and specific (though it often provides enough information to help you find the person, place, or thing, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time). If you know only rumors, the casting time is 2d6 weeks, and the resulting lore is vague and incomplete (though it often directs you to more detailed information, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time).
\par During the casting, you cannot cast other spells or engage in other than routine activities: eating, sleeping, and so forth. When completed, the divination brings legends (if any) about the person, place, or things to your mind. These may be legends that are still current, legends that have been forgotten, or even information that has never been generally known. If the person, place, or thing is not of legendary importance, you gain no information. As a rule of thumb, characters who are 11th level and higher are ``legendary," as are the sorts of creatures they contend with, the major magic items they wield, and the places where they perform their key deeds.

\par The spell can be cast on only a single tree at a time; while \spell{liveoak} is in effect, you can't cast it again on another tree. The tree on which the spell is cast must be within 10 feet of your dwelling place, within a place sacred to you, or within 300 feet of something that you wish to guard or protect.

\spelleffect You conjure up an extradimensional dwelling that has a single entrance on the plane from which the spell was cast. The entry point looks like a faint shimmering in the air that is 4 feet wide and 8 feet high. Only those you designate may enter the mansion, and the portal is shut and made invisible behind you when you enter. You may open it again from your own side at will. Once observers have passed beyond the entrance, they are in a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.
\par You can create any floor plan you desire to the limit of the spell's effect. The place is furnished and contains sufficient foodstuffs to serve a nine-course banquet to a dozen people per caster level. A staff of near-transparent servants (as many as two per caster level), liveried and obedient, wait upon all who enter. The servants function as \spell{unseen servant} spells except that they are visible and can go anywhere in the mansion.

Divination (scrying) spells cannot perceive anything within the area, and those within are immune to \spell{detect thoughts}. The ward prevents speech between those inside and those outside (because it blocks sound), but it does not prevent other communication, such as a sending or message spell, or telepathic communication, such as that between a wizard and her familiar.

\spelleffect You alter an item's aura so that it registers  to  detect spells (and spells with similar  capabilities) as though it were less magical, or a magic item of a kind you specify, or the subject of a spell you specify. You can increase or decrease the strength of the aura of an item by an amount up to your caster level. For example, if you have a caster level of 8, you could alter a magic item with a caster level of 6 to make it seem as if it were nonmagical, or you could make it seem as if it had a caster level of 14.
\par If the object bearing \spell{magic aura}  has \spell{identify} cast on it or is similarly examined, the examiner recognizes that the aura is false and detects the object's actual qualities if he succeeds on a Will save.
\par Otherwise, he believes the aura and no  amount of testing reveals what the true  magic is.
\par If the targeted item's own aura is exceptionally powerful (if it is an artifact, for  instance), \spell{magic aura} doesn't work.

\spellattack{Will negates (object)}
\spelleffect This spell imbues the chosen object or creature with an enchanted mouth that suddenly appears and speaks its message the next time a specified event occurs. The message, which must be twenty-five or fewer words long, can be in any language known by you and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes. The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak. Of course, magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object or creature.
\par The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A magic mouth cannot distinguish alignment, level, or class except by external garb.
\par The range limit of a trigger is 100 feet. Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.

\spelleffect You draw an indelible mark on the subject and state some behavior on the part of the subject that will activate the mark. When activated, the mark curses the subject. Typically, you designate some sort of criminal behavior that activates the mark, but you can pick any act you please. The effect of the mark is identical with the effect of bestow curse.
\par Since this spell takes 10 minutes to cast and involves writing on the target, you can cast it only on a creature that is willing or restrained.
\par Like the effect of \spell{bestow curse}, a \spell{mark of justice} cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a \spell{break enchantment}, \spell{limited wish}, \spell{miracle}, \spell{remove curse}, or \spell{wish} spell. \spell{Remove curse} works only if its caster level is higher.

\spelleffect Mending repairs small breaks or tears in objects (but not warps, such as might be caused by a \spell{warp wood} spell). It will weld broken metallic objects such as a ring, a chain link, a medallion, or a slender dagger, providing but one break exists.
\par Ceramic or wooden objects with multiple breaks can be invisibly rejoined to be as strong as new. A hole in a leather sack or a wineskin is completely healed over by \spell{mending}. The spell can repair items which are magical, but the item's magical abilities are not restored.

The spell does not restore the magical abilities of a broken magic item made whole, and it cannot mend broken magic rods, staffs, or wands.

This spell protects against all mind-affecting spells and effects as well as information gathering by divination spells or effects. Mind blank even foils limited wish, miracle, and wish spells when they are used in such a way as to affect the subject's mind or to gain information about it. In the case of scrying that scans an area the creature is in, such as arcane eye, the spell works but the creature simply isn't detected.

\spelleffect As part of performing this ritual, you choose another object within range. For the duration of the ritual, the subject of \spell{misdirection} is detected as if it were the other object. No saving throw is allowed against this effect. Detection spells provide information based on the second object rather than on the actual target of the detection unless the caster of the detection succeeds on a Will save. For instance, you could make yourself detect as a tree if one were within range at casting: not evil, not lying, not magical, neutral in alignment, and so forth.

\spellsr{Yes}
\spellattack{Will negates}
\spelleffect You reach into the subject's mind and modify as many as 5 minutes of its memories in one of the following ways.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Eliminate all memory of an event the subject actually experienced. This can negate the effects of spells like \spell{suggestion} which require specific memories (such as a command given) to function.
    \item Allow the subject to recall with perfect clarity an event it actually experienced.
    \item Change the details of an event the subject actually experienced.
    \item Implant a memory of an event the subject never experienced.
\end{itemize}
\par Performing the ritual takes 1 minute. If the subject fails its save, you proceed with the spell by spending as much as 5 minutes (a period of time equal to the amount of memory time you want to modify) visualizing the memory you wish to modify in the subject. If your concentration is disturbed before the visualization is complete, or if the subject is ever beyond the spell's range during this time, the spell is lost.
\par This spell does not grant you the ability to see the subject's memories. If you wish to modify a specific memory, you must have a good idea of what the subject experienced.
\spellnotes A modified memory does not necessarily affect the subject's actions, particularly if it contradicts the creature's natural inclinations. An illogical modified memory is dismissed by the creature as a bad dream or a memory muddied by too much wine.

\spelleffect This ritual moves dirt (clay, loam, sand), possibly collapsing embankments, moving hillocks, shifting dunes, and so forth.
\par However, in no event can rock formations be collapsed or moved. The area to be affected determines the casting time. For every 150-foot square (up to 10 feet deep), casting takes 10 minutes. The maximum area, 750 feet by 750 feet, takes 4 hours and 10 minutes to move.
\par This spell does not violently break the surface of the ground. Instead, it creates wavelike crests and troughs, with the earth reacting with glacierlike fluidity until the desired result is achieved. Trees, structures, rock formations, and such are mostly unaffected except for changes in elevation and relative topography.
\spellnotes The ritual cannot be used for tunneling and is generally too slow to trap or bury creatures. Its primary use is for digging or filling moats or for adjusting terrain contours before a battle. It has no effect on earth creatures.

A poisoned  creature suffers no additional effects from  the poison, and any temporary effects are ended, but the spell does not reverse  instantaneous effects, such as hit point  damage, temporary ability damage, or  effects that don't go away on their own.
\par The creature is immune to any poison it  is exposed to during the duration of the  spell. Unlike with delay poison, such effects aren't postponed until after the duration - the creature need not make any saves  against poison effects applied to it during  the length of the spell.

If you are disturbed during the trance, you must succeed on a Concentration check as if you were in the midst of casting a spell or the spell ends. If you choose to enter a trance, you are not aware of your surroundings or the activities around you while in the trance. You are defenseless, both physically and mentally, while in the trance.

\spelldur{\durext or until discharged}
\spelleffect This ritual creates an ethereal passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not other materials. The phase door is invisible and inaccessible to all creatures except you, and only you can use the passage. It can be used a number of times equal to half your caster level before the ritual ends. You disappear when you enter the phase door and appear when you exit. If you desire, you can take one other creature (Medium or smaller) through the door. This counts as two uses of the door. The door does not allow light, sound, or ritual effects through it, nor can you see through it without using it. Thus, the ritual can provide an escape route, though certain creatures, such as phase spiders, can follow with ease.
\par You can allow other creatures to use the phase door by setting some triggering condition for the door. Such conditions can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. They can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, and hit points don't qualify.
\spellnotes The \spell{true seeing} spell or similar magic reveals the presence of a phase door but does not allow its use. A \spell{phase door} is subject to \spell{dispel magic}. If anyone is within the passage when it is dispelled, he is harmlessly ejected just as if he were inside a \spell{passwall} effect. This ritual can be made permanent with a \spell{permanency} ritual.

\spellattack{Will negates}
\spelleffect Performing this ritual attempts a dangerous act: to lure a creature from another plane to a specifically prepared trap. The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom.
\par The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual's proper name in casting the spell.
\par The chosen creature is allowed a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from being called).
\par The trap takes the form of a magic circle which you inscribe in the ground. The trapped creature and all of its abilities cannot cross the circle's boundaries and can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the creature has any form of dimensional travel, it can leave the circle through that means. Once per day, the trapped creature can attempt to escape, forcing you to overcome its spell resistance to keep it trapped. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you.
\par If you spend two hours performing the ritual, you can make make it more secure. This allows you to add a \spell{dimensional anchor} spell, a \spell{dimensional lock} spell, or other similar effect to the trap before the creature is summoned. If you do so, the effects last as long as the creature remains in the trap. In addition, if you make the magic circle more secure in this way, the trapped creature cannot use its spell resistance to break out of the trap.
\par If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a Persuasion check. If you fail, the creature refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you fail on the Persuasion check by 10 or more, the creature can make a Will save to break free of the binding, allowing it to escape or attack you.
\par Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only so inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete though its own actions the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free.
\spellnotes A clever subject can subvert some instructions. When you use a calling ritual to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a ritual of that type.

\spelleffect You move yourself or some other creature to another plane of existence or alternate dimension. If several willing persons link hands in a circle, as many as eight can be affected by the plane shift at the same time. Precise accuracy as to a particular arrival location on the intended plane is nigh impossible, and you typically appear 5 to 500 miles (5d\%) from your intended destination. From the Material Plane, you can reach any adjacent plane: the Ethereal Plane, the Plane of Shadow, or the Astral Plane. The Astral Plane connects to every plane, but transit from other planes is usually more limited.

\spelleffect This ritual enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour on objects or creatures within \rngclose range of you by concentrating (a standard action). The effects are minor and have severe limitations. A \spell{prestidigitation} can slowly lift 1 pound of material. It can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round. It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material. It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters. \spell{Prestidigitation} can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created by a prestidigitation spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components.
\spellnotes This ritual lacks the power to duplicate spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour. Creatures and attended objects, such as the clothes a creature is wearing, cannot be affected unless the creature is willing. Spell resistance does not apply to you, but it does apply to any objects or creatures you try to affect.

You set the triggering condition when casting the spell. The event that triggers the illusion can be as general or as specific and detailed as desired but must be based on an audible, tactile, olfactory, or visual trigger. The trigger cannot be based on some quality not normally obvious to the senses, such as alignment. (See \spell{magic mouth} for more details about such triggers.)

\spellinfo{Conjuration (Creation)}{Arcane}
\spelltwocol{\spelltime{1 minute}}{\spellrng{One mile}}
\spelldur{\durext; see text \dismissable}
\spelleffect You create a number of semitangible, visible magical orbs (called ``eyes") equal to your caster level. These eyes move out, scout around, and return as you direct them when casting the spell. Each eye can see 120 feet (normal vision only) in all directions.
\par While the individual eyes are quite fragile, they're small and difficult to spot. Each eye is a Fine construct, about the size of a small apple, that has 1 hit point, a physical defense of 18 (\plus8 size bonus), flies at a speed of 30 feet with perfect maneuverability, and has a \plus16 Stealth modifier. It has a Perception modifier equal to your caster level and is subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that would affect your ability to receive visual information about your surroundings. An eye traveling through darkness must find its way by touch.
\par When you create the eyes, you specify instructions you want them to follow in a command of no more than twenty-five words. Any knowledge you possess is known by the eyes as well.
\par In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to your hand. Each replays in your mind all it has seen during its existence. It takes an eye 1 round to replay 1 hour of recorded images. After relaying its findings, an eye disappears.
\par If an eye ever gets more than 1 mile away from you, it instantly ceases to exist. However, your link with the eye is such that you won't know if the eye was destroyed because it wandered out of range or because of some other event.
\par The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level or until they return to you.
\spellnotes \spellindirect{dispel magic}{Dispel magic} can destroy eyes. If an eye is sent into darkness, it could hit a wall or similar obstacle and destroy itself.

This spell does not prevent subsequent natural decay or spoilage. Unholy water and similar food and drink of significance is spoiled by \spell{purify food and drink}, but the spell has no effect on creatures of any type or magical liquids, such as potions.

\spelltime{1 minute}
\spelltwocol{\spelltgt{Dead creature touched}}{\spellrng{Touch}}
\spellattack{None; see text}
\spelleffect You restore life to a creature that has been dead for no longer than thirty days. The subject's soul must be free and willing to return. If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.
\par Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject gains a negative level. If the subject was 1st level when it died, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead. This negative level or Constitution drain lasts for one month, or until the subject next gains a level. A character who died with spells prepared has a 50\% chance of losing any given spell upon being raised, in addition to losing spells for losing a level. A spellcasting creature that doesn't prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50\% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell, in addition to losing spell slots for losing a level.
\par A raised creature has 0 hit points and 1 critical damage. Any attribute damage is removed. Normal poison and normal disease are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and curses are not undone. While the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to be raised must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is brought back to life. None of the dead creature's equipment or possessions are affected in any way by this spell.
\spellnotes A creature who has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can't be raised by this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be raised. The spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age.

This deciphering does not normally invoke the magic contained in the writing, although it may do so in the case of a cursed scroll. Furthermore, once the spell is cast and you have read the magical inscription, you are thereafter able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of \spell{read magic}. The spell allows you to identify a \spell{glyph of warding} with a DC 13 Spellcraft check, a \spell{greater glyph of warding} with a DC 16 Spellcraft check, or any \spellindirect{symbol of death}{symbol} spell with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 \add spell level).

\spellinfo{Conjuration/Necromancy (Creation, Soul)}{Nature}
\spelltime{1 hour}
\spelltwocol{\spelltgt{Dead creature touched}}{\spellrng{Touch}}
\spellattack{None; see text}
\spelleffect With this spell, you bring back a dead creature in another body, provided that its death occurred no more than one week before the casting of the spell and the subject's soul is free and willing to return. If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.
\par Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains and the cause of death, except death from old age, is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature's body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature's body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. The body ages to match the age of the original creature over the course of the ritual.
\par A reincarnated creature is identical to the original creature in all respects, including physical abilities, except for its race. First eliminate the subject's racial adjustments (since it is no longer of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining attribute scores. The subject gains a permanent negative level. (If this reduction would put its effective level at 0, it can't be reincarnated). This negative level lasts for one month, or until the subject next gains a level.
\par It's possible for the change in the subject's attributes to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class. If this is the case, the subject is well advised to become a multiclass character.
\par For a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the following table. For nonhumanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created.
\par Any effect that would prevent a resurrection spell from bringing a creature back from the dead also prevents reincarnate from bringing the creature back. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be reincarnated. The spell cannot bring back a creature who has died of old age.

\par Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no loss of prepared spells. The subject gains a negative level. If the subject was 1st level when it died, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead. This negative level or Constitution drain lasts for one month, or until the subject next gains a level.

\spelleffect You hide a chest on the Ethereal Plane for as long as sixty days and can retrieve it at will. The chest can contain up to 1 cubic foot of material per caster level (regardless of the chest's actual size, which is about 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet). If any living creatures are in the chest, there is a 75\% chance that the spell simply fails. Once the chest is hidden, you can retrieve it by concentrating (a standard action), and it appears next to you.
\par The chest must be exceptionally well crafted and expensive, constructed for you by master crafters. The cost of such a chest is never less than 500 gp. Once it is constructed, you must make a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every detail), so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy. (The replica costs 25 gp.) You can have only one pair of these chests at any given time. The chests are nonmagical and can be fitted with locks, wards, and so on, just as any normal chest can be.
\par To hide the chest, you cast the ritual while touching both the chest and the replica. The chest vanishes into the Ethereal Plane. You need the replica to recall the chest. After sixty days, there is a cumulative chance of 5\% per day that the chest is irretrievably lost. If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, not even with a wish spell, that the large chest can be summoned back, although an extraplanar expedition might be mounted to find it.
\par Living things in the chest eat, sleep, and age normally, and they die if they run out of food, air, water, or whatever they need to survive.

\spelleffect You conjure a sturdy cottage or lodge made of material that is common in the area where the spell is cast. The floor is level, clean, and dry. In all respects the lodging resembles a normal cottage, with a sturdy door, two shuttered windows, and a small fireplace.
\par The shelter has no heating or cooling source (other than natural insulation qualities). Therefore, it must be heated as a normal dwelling, and extreme heat adversely affects it and its occupants. The dwelling does, however, provide considerable security otherwise -- it is as strong as a normal stone building, regardless of its material composition. The dwelling resists flames and fire as if it were stone. It is impervious to normal missiles (but not the sort cast by siege engines or giants).
\par The door, shutters, and even chimney are secure against intrusion, the former two being locked and the latter secured by an iron grate at the top and a narrow flue. In addition, these three areas are protected by an alarm spell. Finally, an \spell{unseen servant} is conjured to provide service to you for the duration of the shelter.

\spelleffect To use this spell, you must be in an area of shadowy illumination. You and any other subjects are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow. The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real. You can take more than one creature along with you, but all must be touching each other.
\par In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane. Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane.
\par Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can't make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end. It's impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying. Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10\mtimes 100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted an additional 1d10\mtimes 1,000 feet in the same direction. If this would still place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued (no save).

\par Any creatures touched by you when \spell{shadow walk} is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Plane of Shadow.
\par They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50\% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you). Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of Shadow receive a Will saving throw, negating the effect if successful.

In this case, the shamblers can only be ordered to guard a specific site or location. Shamblers summoned to guard duty cannot move outside the spell's range, which is measured from the point where each first appeared.

\spelleffect This ritual enables you to make a snare that functions as a magic trap. The snare can be made from any supple vine, a thong, or a rope. When you cast \spell{snare} upon it, the cordlike object blends with its surroundings (Perception DC 23 to locate). One end of the snare is tied in a loop that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside the circle.
\par If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare can be fastened to it. The spell causes the tree to bend and then straighten when the loop is triggered, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped and lifting it off the ground by the trapped limb or limbs. If no such tree is available, the cordlike object tightens around the creature, dealing no damage but causing it to be entangled.
\par The snare is magical. To escape, a trapped creature must make a DC 23 Escape Artist check or a DC 23 Strength check that is a full-round action. The snare has a physical defense of 2 and 5 hit points. A successful escape from the snare breaks the loop and ends the spell.

\spellattack{Will negates; see text}
\spelleffect You grant the semblance of life and intellect to a corpse, allowing it to answer several questions that you put to it. You may ask one question per two caster levels. Unasked questions are wasted if the duration expires. The corpse's knowledge is limited to what the creature knew during life, including the languages it spoke (if any). Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive. If the creature's alignment was different from yours, the corpse gets a Will save to resist the spell as if it were alive.
\par If the corpse has been subject to \spell{speak with dead} within the past week, the new spell fails. You can cast this spell on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the body must be mostly intact to be able to respond. A damaged corpse may be able to give partial answers or partially correct answers, but it must at least have a mouth in order to speak at all.
\par This spell does not let you actually speak to the person (whose soul has departed). It instead draws on the imprinted knowledge stored in the corpse. The partially animated body retains the imprint of the soul that once inhabited it, and thus it can speak with all the knowledge that the creature had while alive. The corpse, however, cannot learn new information. Indeed, it can't even remember being questioned.

It can be set to trigger in response to any visual cue that takes place within \rngclose range of the symbol which can be ``seen'' by the symbol. Darkness does not stop the symbol's sight, but physical obstacles or illusions block it. Once the ritual is performed, the triggering conditions cannot be changed.
\par When scribing a \spell{symbol of death}, you can specify a password or phrase. Anyone speaking the password cannot trigger the rune so long as the creature remains within \rngmed range of the rune. If the creature leaves that range and returns later, it must say the password again.
\spellnotes The symbol is considered to have a Perception modifier equal to your caster level. Magic traps such as \spell{symbol of death} can be detected with the Perception skill and disabled with the Devices skill. The DC in each case is 25 \add spell level, or 32 for \spell{symbol of death}.
\par \spellindirect{read magic}{Read magic} allows you to identify a \spell{symbol of death} with a DC 17 Spellcraft check. Of course, if the symbol of death is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.
\par \spellindirect{dispel magic}{Dispel magic} can remove a \spell{symbol of death}, but an \spell{erase} spell has no effect. Destruction of the surface where a \spell{symbol of death} is inscribed destroys the symbol but also triggers it on the closest creature within \rngclose range of the symbol.

If the spell is cast upon a target that is not freestanding, the surrounding stone dissipates the effect and no damage occurs.

\spelleffect This spell instantly transports you and the subjects to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles away. Each creature can bring along objects whose weight doesn't exceed the creature's maximum load. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. After completing the spell, you and anyone bring with you must skip their next actions as they adjust to their new surroundings.
\par By doubling the casting time of the ritual, you can take along an additional Medium creature. You can repeat this process, doubling the new casting time each time, up to a maximum casting time of just over an hour (allowing you to take a total of ten Medium creatures in addition to yourself).
\par You can also bring creatures larger than Medium. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth.
\par This ritual is unusually difficult to perform correctly. You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. As part of the ritual, you make an Intelligence check against DC 10. The following categories apply modifiers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ``Very familiar" is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. You gain a \plus5 bonus.
    \item ``Studied carefully" is a place you know well, either because you can currently see it, you've been there often, or you have used other means (such as scrying) to study the place for at least one hour. No bonuses or penalties apply.
    \item ``Seen casually" is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. You take a \minus5 penalty.
    \item ``Viewed once" is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic. You take a \minus10 penalty.
    \item ``False destination" is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. You automatically fail.
\end{itemize}

Success means you arrive on target. Failure means you arrive a random distance away from your intended destination in a random direction. The distance off target is equal to 1d10\mult1d10\% of the distance that you would have traveled to your intended destination. Failure by 10 or more means you arrive in a completely different area within range that is visually or thematically similar to your intended destination.
\spellnotes This ritual is incapable of interplanar travel. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell's range, the ritual simply fails instead.

Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws. You do not apply spell resistance against this ritual.

In addition, you need not have seen the destination, provided that you have an accurate and specific description of the place to which you are teleporting.

\spelltime{1 minute}
\spellzone{\areamed radius centered on you}
\spelldur{\durext \dismissable}
\spelleffect You create an unmoving, opaque sphere of any color you desire around your location. Half the sphere projects above the ground, and the lower hemisphere passes through the ground. As many as nine other Medium creatures can fit into the field with you; they can freely pass into and out of the hut without harming it. However, if you remove yourself from the hut, the spell ends.
\par The temperature inside the hut is 70\degree F if the exterior temperature is between 0\degree and 100\degree F. An exterior temperature below 0\degree or above 100\degree lowers or raises the interior temperature on a 1-degree-for-1 basis. The hut also provides protection against the elements, such as rain, dust, and sandstorms. The hut withstands any wind of less than hurricane force, but a hurricane (75\add mph wind speed) or greater force destroys it.
\par The interior of the hut is a hemisphere. Although the force field is opaque from the outside, it is transparent from within. Missiles, weapons, and most spell effects can pass through the hut without affecting it, although the occupants cannot be seen from outside the hut (they have total concealment).

\spellsection{Transport via Plants}{6}
\spellinfo{Conjuration (Translocation) [Teleportation]}{Nature}
\spelleffect This ritual functions like \spell{teleport}, except that both the starting and ending points must be living, Medium or larger plants. You and any other creatures you bring with you step into one plant and out of the other plant.
\begin{comment}
You can enter any normal plant (Medium or larger) and pass any distance to a plant of the same kind in a single round, regardless of the distance separating the two. The entry plant must be alive. The destination plant need not be familiar to you, but it also must be alive. If you are uncertain of the location of a particular kind of destination plant, you need merely designate direction and distance and the transport via plants spell moves you as close as possible to the desired location. If a particular destination plant is desired but the plant is not living, the spell fails and you are ejected from the entry plant.
\par After completing the spell, you and anyone bring with you can't take any actions until the next turn that each creature would have.
\par You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. Use the following equivalents to determine the maximum number of larger creatures you can bring along: A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you.
\par You can't use this spell to travel through plant creatures.
\par The destruction of an occupied plant slays you and any creatures you have brought along, and ejects the bodies and all carried objects from the tree.

\spellinfo{Necromancy (Life, Soul)}{Arcane}
\spelltwocol{\spelltgt{One trigger object; see text}}{\spellrng{Touch}}
\spelldur{Permanent; see text}
\spellsr{Yes}
\spelleffect You imbue an object with the power to trap a creature's life and soul. The object must be inscribed with the creature's name. It holds the trapped creature indefinitely or until it is broken, which allows the creature's body to reform. Outsiders can be compelled to perform a single service for the creature releasing them; other creatures can simply go free.
\par For a creature's soul to be trapped, it must intentionally pick up or accept the object while \bloodied. If it does so, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem without the benefit of a save, though spell resistance applies normally. If it picks up the object while healthy, or if any other creature picks up the object, nothing happens, though magical inspection can reveal the existence of the trap.
\spellmat{In addition to the trigger object, a gem must be used. The gem must be worth at least 500 gp value for every level possessed by the creature to be trapped. When the ritual is performed, the gem shatters into dust which is embedded into the trigger object. If the gem is not valuable enough, the creature will suffer no ill effect when it picks up the trigger object, though the ritual's effect will still be discharged, rending the trigger object useless. (While creatures have no concept of level as such, the value of the gem needed to trap an individual can be researched. Remember that this value can change over time as creatures gain more levels.)}

\spelleffect This ritual functions like \spell{teleport}, except that it only affects you, and both the starting and ending points must be Large or larger trees.
\begin{comment}
You gain the ability to enter trees and move from inside one tree to inside another tree. The first tree you enter and all others you enter must be of the same kind, must be living, and must have girth at least equal to yours. By moving into an oak tree (for example), you instantly know the location of all other oak trees within transport range (see below) and may choose whether you want to pass into one or simply step back out of the tree you moved into. You may choose to pass to any tree of the appropriate kind within the transport range as shown on the following table.
\begin{dtable}
    \begin{tabularx}{\columnwidth}{>{\lcol}X >{\lcol}X}
        Type of Tree & Transport Range \\
        Oak, ash, yew & 3,000 feet \\

        Other deciduous & 1,500 feet \\
        Any coniferous & 1,000 feet \\
        All other trees & 500 feet
    \end{tabularx}
\end{dtable}
\par You may move into a tree up to one time per caster level (passing from one tree to another counts only as moving into one tree). The spell lasts until the duration expires or you exit a tree. Each transport is a full-round action.
\par You can, at your option, remain within a tree without transporting yourself, but you are forced out when the spell ends. If the tree in which you are concealed is chopped down or burned, you are slain if you do not exit before the process is complete.

\spelleffect This spell functions like \spell{raise dead}, except that you can resurrect a creature that has been dead for as long as 10 years per caster level. This spell can even bring back creatures whose bodies have been destroyed, provided that you unambiguously identify the deceased in some fashion (reciting the deceased's time and place of birth or death is the most common method).
\par Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no negative levels, constitution drain, or loss of prepared spells.
\par You can revive someone killed by a death effect or someone who has been turned into an undead creature and then destroyed. This spell can also resurrect elementals or outsiders, but it can't resurrect constructs or undead creatures.
\spellnotes Even \spell{true resurrection} can't restore to life a creature who has died of old age.

\spellattack{See text}
\spelleffect Unhallow makes a particular site, building, or structure an unholy site. This has three major effects.
\par First, the site or structure is guarded by a \spell{magic circle against good} effect.
\par Second, any dead body interred in an unhallowed site costs half the normal material components to raise as an undead creature.
\par Finally, you may choose to fix a single spell effect to the unhallowed site. The spell effect lasts for one year and functions throughout the entire site, regardless of its normal duration and area or effect. You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that share your faith or alignment, or creatures that adhere to another faith or alignment. At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting unhallow again.
\par Spell effects that may be tied to an unhallowed site include \spell{aid}, \spell{bane}, \spell{bless}, \spell{cause fear}, \spell{darkness}, \spell{daylight}, \spell{death ward}, \spell{detect evil}, \spell{dimensional anchor}, \spell{discern lies}, \spell{endure elements}, \spell{freedom of movement}, \spell{invisibility purge}, \spell{protection from energy}, \spell{remove fear}, \spell{resist energy}, \spell{silence}, \spell{tongues}, and \spell{zone of truth}.
\par Saving throws and spell resistance might apply to these spells' effects. (See the individual spell descriptions for details.)
\spellnotes An area can receive only one hallow or unhallow spell (and its associated spell effect) at a time. If an area is hallowed, it cannot be unhallowed.

\spelltwocol{\spelltime{1 minute}}{\spellrng{\rngmed}}
\spelldur{\durlong \dismissable}
\spelleffect An unseen servant is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command. It can run and fetch things, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as clean and mend. The servant can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity over and over again if told to do so as long as you remain within range. It can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, and the like. It has an effective Strength score of 2 (so it can lift 20 pounds or drag 100 pounds). It can trigger traps and such, but it can exert only 20 pounds of force, which is not enough to activate certain pressure plates and other devices. It can't perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a check using a skill that can't be used untrained. Its speed is 15 feet.
\par The servant cannot attack in any way. It cannot be killed, but it dissipates if it takes 6 points of damage from area attacks. (It gets no saves against attacks.) If you attempt to send it beyond the spell's range (measured from your current position), the servant ceases to exist.

\spelltime{1 minute}
\spelleffect This ritual functions like \spell{legend lore}, except that it works more quickly but produces some strain on you. You pose a question about some person, place, or object, then perform the ritual. If the person or object is at hand or if you are in the place in question, you receive a vision about it by succeeding on a caster level check (1d20 \add caster level) against DC 20. If only detailed information on the person, place, or object is known, the DC is 25, and the information gained is incomplete. If only rumors are known, the DC is 30, and the information gained is vague. After the spell is complete, you are exhausted.
\par If you perform this ritual while fatigued or exhausted, you must make a Fortitude save (DC 15 if fatigued or DC 20 if exhausted) or immediately fall unconscious for ten minutes. When you wake up, you remember the information (if any).

\spelldur{\durext or until discharged}
\spelleffect You send a message or sound on the wind to a designated spot. The whispering wind travels to a specific location within range that is familiar to you, provided that it can find a way to the location. A whispering wind is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches the location. It then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other sound. Note that the message is delivered regardless of whether anyone is present to hear it. The wind then dissipates.
\par You can prepare the spell to bear a message of no more than twenty-five words, cause the spell to deliver other sounds for 1 round, or merely have the whispering wind seem to be a faint stirring of the air. You can likewise cause the whispering wind to move as slowly as 1 mile per hour or as quickly as 1 mile per 10 minutes.

\spellsr{Yes}
\spelleffect \par You alter the substance of your body to a cloudlike vapor (as the \spell{gaseous form} spell) and move through the air, possibly at great speed. You can take other creatures with you, each of which acts independently.
\par Normally, a wind walker flies at a speed of 10 feet with perfect maneuverability. If desired by the subject, a magical wind wafts a wind walker along at up to 600 feet per round (60 mph) with poor maneuverability. Wind walkers are not invisible but rather appear misty and translucent. If fully clothed in white, they are likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, or the like.
\par A wind walker can regain its physical form as desired and later resume the cloud form. Each change to and from vaporous form takes 5 rounds, which counts toward the duration of the ritual (as does any time spent in physical form). As noted above, you can dismiss the ritual, and you can even dismiss it for individual wind walkers and not others.
\par For the last minute of the ritual's duration, a wind walker in cloud form automatically descends 60 feet per round (for a total of 600 feet), though it may descend faster if it wishes. This descent serves as a warning that the ritual is about to end.
