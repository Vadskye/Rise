\begin{spelleffect}
\ritual{Alarm} sounds a mental or audible alarm each time a creature of Tiny or larger size enters the warded area. If you set a password as you cast the spell, a creature that speaks the password before entering the area does not trigger the alarm. You decide at the time of casting whether the alarm will be mental or audible.
\par \subspell{Mental Alarm} A mental alarm alerts you (and only you) so long as you remain within 1 mile of the warded area. You note a single mental ``ping'' that awakens you from normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb concentration. A \ritual{silence} spell has no effect on a mental alarm.
\par \subspell{Audible Alarm} An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell. It is typically clearly audible up to 100 feet away. The sound lasts for 1 round. 
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
A \spell{silence} spell or similar effect can prevent the alarm from being heard. Ethereal or astral creatures do not trigger the alarm. \ritual{Alarm} can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

\spelldur{Instantaneous}
\spellsave{None}
\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
This ritual turns the bones or bodies of recently dead creatures into undead skeletons or zombies by binding a fragment of their souls to the corpses. The undead so created follow your spoken commands.
\par The undead can follow you, or they can remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific kind of creature) entering the place. They remain animated until they are destroyed.
\par Regardless of the type of undead you create with this ritual, you can't create more HV of undead than twice your caster level with a single casting of \ritual{animate dead}.
\par The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this ritual, however, you can control only 4 HV worth of undead creatures per caster level. If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control, and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled. (You choose which creatures are released.) If you are a cleric, any undead you might command by virtue of your power to command or rebuke undead do not count toward the limit.
\par \subspell{Skeletons} A skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact corpse or skeleton. The corpse must have bones. If a skeleton is made from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones.
\par \subspell{Zombies} A zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The corpse must be that of a creature with a true anatomy.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
A destroyed skeleton or zombie can't be animated again.
\end{spellnotes}
\spellmat{You must place a black onyx gem worth at least 25 gp per Hit Value of the undead into the mouth or eye socket of each corpse you intend to animate. The magic of the ritual turns these gems into worthless, burned-out shells.}

\spellsection{Animal Messenger}

\spelltgt{One Tiny animal}
\spelldur{One week}
\spellsave{None; see text}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
As soon as you begin casting the ritual, the animal approaches you and awaits your bidding. You can mentally impress on the animal a certain place well known to you or an obvious landmark. The directions must be simple, because the animal depends on your knowledge and can't find a destination on its own. During the casting of the ritual, you can attach some small item or note to the messenger. The animal then goes to the designated location and waits there, straying only to gather food and water as necessary, until the duration of the ritual expires. During this period of waiting, the messenger allows others to approach it and remove any scroll or token it carries.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
The most common use for this ritual is to get an animal to carry a message to your allies. The animal cannot be one tamed or trained by someone else, including such creatures as familiars and animal companions. The intended recipient gains no special ability to communicate with the animal or read any attached message (if it's written in a language he or she doesn't know, for example).

\spelltgt{One location (up to a 10 ft. cube/level) or one object}
\spelldur{One week (D)}
\spellsave{Will partial}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
You cause an object or location to emanate magical vibrations that repel either a specific kind of intelligent creature or creatures of a particular alignment, as defined by you. Creatures of the designated kind or alignment feel an overpowering revulsion while in the area or near the item. The kind of creature to be affected must be named specifically. A creature subtype is not specific enough. Likewise, the specific alignment to be repelled must be named.
\par An affected creature abandons the area or item, shunning it and never willingly returning to it while the ritual is in effect. A creature that makes a successful saving throw can stay in the area or touch the item but is demoralized while doing so.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
A demoralized creature takes a \minus2 penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, checks, DCs, and AC. \ritual{Antipathy} counters and dispels \ritual{sympathy}.

\spellrng{\rngmed/Unlimited}
\spelleff{Magical sensor}
\spelldur{\durlong (D)}
\spellsave{None}
\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
You create an invisible magical sensor that sends you visual information. You can create the \ritual{arcane eye} within \rngmed range, but it can then travel outside your line of sight without hindrance. An \ritual{arcane eye} travels at 30 feet per round. It sees exactly as you would see if you were there.
\par The eye can travel in any direction as long as the ritual lasts. Solid barriers block its passage, but it can pass through a hole or space as small as 1 inch in diameter. The eye can't enter another plane of existence, even through a \spell{gate} or similar magical portal.
\par You must concentrate to use an \ritual{arcane eye}. If you do not concentrate, the eye is inert until you again concentrate.
\end{spelleffect}

\spellsection{Arcane Lock}

\spellrng{Touch}
\spelltgt{The door, chest, or portal touched, up to 30 sq. ft./level in size}
\spelldur{Permanent}
\spellsave{None}
\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
The target object is magically locked. You can freely pass your own \ritual{arcane lock} without affecting it; otherwise, a door or object secured with this ritual can be opened only by breaking in or with a successful \ritual{dispel magic} or \ritual{knock} spell. Add 10 to the normal DC to break open a door or portal affected by this ritual.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
A \ritual{knock} spell does not remove an arcane lock; it only suppresses the effect for 10 minutes.
\end{spellnotes}

\spellsection{Arcane Mark}

\begin{spelleffect}
You etch your personal rune or mark upon any substance without harm to the material upon which it is placed. Your personal rune or mark can consist of no more than six characters. The writing can be visible or invisible.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
If an \spell{arcane mark} is placed on a living being, normal wear gradually causes the effect to fade in about a month. Arcane mark must be cast on an object prior to casting \spell{instant summons} on the same object.

This ritual does not require training any specific skill to learn, and no check is required to perform the ritual.

\begin{spelleffect}
This ritual allows the subjects to explore the Astral Plane. The subjects are partially transported to the Astral Plane. Though their physical bodies remain on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation, 
By freeing your spirit from your physical body, this ritual allows you to project an astral body onto another plane altogether.
\par You can bring the astral forms of other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects are linked in a circle with you at the time of the casting. These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you during the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them.
\par You project your astral self onto the Astral Plane, leaving your physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation. The ritual projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or carry onto the Astral Plane. Any changes to the astral copies of your equipment (such as charges used on wands and staffs) are transferred to your original equipment through the silver cord (see below). Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to any of these other planes as you will. To enter one, you leave the Astral Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of existence you have chosen to enter.
\par While you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at all times to your physical body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and physically. Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the incorporeal silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on the Material Plane, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes.
\par You and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane indefinitely. Your bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation until you choose to return your spirits to them. The ritual lasts until you desire to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as \ritual{dispel magic} cast upon either the physical body or the astral form, the breaking of the silver cord, or the destruction of your body back on the Material Plane (which kills you).
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
\par This ritual may only be cast on the Material Plane.

\spelltime{1 hour}
\spellrng{Touch}
\spelltgt{Living creature touched}
\spelldur{Instantaneous}
\spellsave{None}
\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
This ritual removes the burden of evil acts or misdeeds from the subject. The creature seeking atonement must be truly repentant and desirous of setting right its misdeeds. If the atoning creature committed the evil act unwittingly or under some form of compulsion, \ritual{atonement} operates normally at no cost to you. However, in the case of a creature atoning for deliberate misdeeds and acts of a knowing and willful nature, you must intercede with your deity (requiring you to burn 2,500 gp in offerings) in order to expunge the subject's burden. Many casters first assign a subject of this sort a quest (see \ritual{geas/quest}) or similar penance to determine whether the creature is truly contrite before casting the \ritual{atonement} ritual on its behalf.
\par \ritual{Atonement} may be cast for one of several purposes, depending on the version selected.
\par \subspell{Reverse Magical Alignment Change} If a creature has had its alignment magically changed, atonement returns its alignment to its original status at no cost in experience points.
\par \subspell{Restore Class} A paladin who has lost her class features due to committing an evil act may have her paladinhood restored to her by this ritual.
\par \subspell{Restore Cleric or Druid Spell Powers} A cleric or druid who has lost the ability to cast spells by incurring the anger of his or her deity may regain that ability by seeking \ritual{atonement} from another cleric of the same deity or another druid. If the transgression was intentional, the casting cleric must burn 2,500 gp in rare incense and offerings for his intercession. If the transgression was unintentional, no such offering must be made.
\par \subspell{Redemption or Temptation} You may cast this ritual upon a creature of an opposing alignment in order to offer it a chance to change its alignment to match yours. The prospective subject must be present for the entire casting process. Upon completion of the ritual, the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment. No duress, compulsion, or magical influence can force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered if it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment. This use of the ritual does not work on outsiders or any creature incapable of changing its alignment naturally.
\par Though the ritual description refers to evil acts, atonement can also be used on any creature that has performed acts against its alignment, whether those acts are evil, good, chaotic, or lawful.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
\par \subspell{Note} Normally, changing alignment is up to the player. This use of atonement simply offers a believable way for a character to change his or her alignment drastically, suddenly, and definitively.
\end{spellnotes}
\spellfocus{In addition to your holy symbol or normal divine focus, you need a set of prayer beads (or other prayer device, such as a prayer wheel or prayer book) worth at least 500 gp.}
\spellmat{When cast for the benefit of a creature whose guilt was the result of deliberate acts, 2,500 gp in rare incense and offerings must be burned.}

\spellsection{Augury}
\spellschool{Divination (Knowledge)}
\spellskill{Religion}
\spelllvl{Divine 2}
\spelltime{1 minute}
\spellrng{Personal}
\spelltgt{You}
\spelldur{Instantaneous}
\begin{spelleffect}
An \ritual{augury} can tell you whether a particular action will bring good or bad results for you in the immediate future.
\par The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70\% \add 1\% per caster level; this roll is made secretly. A question may be so straightforward that a successful result is automatic, or so vague as to have no chance of success. If the augury succeeds, you get one of four results:
\begin{itemize*}
\item Weal (if the action will probably bring good results).
\item Woe (for bad results).
\item Weal and woe (for both).
\item Nothing (for actions that don't have especially good or bad results).
\end{itemize*}
\par If the ritual fails, you get the ``nothing'' result. A cleric who gets the ``nothing'' result has no way to tell whether it was the consequence of a failed or successful \ritual{augury}.
\par The \ritual{augury} can see into the future only about half an hour, so anything that might happen after that does not affect the result. Thus, the result might not take into account the long-term consequences of a contemplated action. All \ritual{auguries} cast by the same person about the same topic use the same dice result as the first casting.

\spellsr{Yes (Will)}
\begin{spelleffect}
You awaken a tree or animal to humanlike sentience.
\par The \ritual{awakened} animal or tree is friendly toward you. You have no special empathy or connection with a creature you awaken, although it serves you in specific tasks or endeavors if you communicate your desires to it.
\par An \ritual{awakened} tree has characteristics as if it were an animated object, except that it gains the plant type and its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are each 3d6. An \ritual{awakened} plant gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it has senses similar to a human's.
\par An \ritual{awakened} animal gets 3d6 Intelligence, \plus1d3 Charisma, and \plus2 HV. Its type becomes magical beast (augmented animal). An \ritual{awakened} animal can't serve as an animal companion, familiar, or special mount.
\par An \ritual{awakened} tree or animal can speak one language that you know, plus one additional language that you know per point of Intelligence bonus (if any).
\end{spelleffect}
\spellmat{Herbs and oils worth no less than 2,000gp must be applied to the animal or plant to be awakened.}

\spellsave{See text}
\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
This ritual frees the subject from enchantments, transmutations, and curses. \ritual{Break enchantment} can reverse even an instantaneous effect. For each such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 \add caster level) against a DC of 11 \add caster level of the effect. Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect. For a cursed magic item, the DC is 25.
\par If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by \ritual{dispel magic}, \ritual{break enchantment} works only if that spell is 5th level or lower.
\par If the effect comes from some permanent magic item, \ritual{break enchantment} does not remove the curse from the item, but it does frees the victim from the item's effects.

\spellsave{None}
\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
This ritual creates an invisible magical sensor at a specific location that enables you to hear or see (your choice) almost as if you were there. You don't need line of sight or line of effect, but the locale must be known -- a place familiar to you or an obvious one. Once you have selected the locale, the sensor doesn't move, but you can rotate it in all directions to view the area as desired. Unlike other scrying spells or rituals, this ritual does not allow magically or supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it. If the chosen locale is magically dark, you see nothing. If it is naturally pitch black, you can see in a \areasmall radius around the center of the ritual's effect. \ritual{Clairaudience/clairvoyance} functions only on the plane of existence you are currently occupying.

\spelldur{Instantaneous}
\spellsave{None}
\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
This ritual makes an inert duplicate of a creature. If the original individual has been slain, its soul immediately transfers to the clone, creating a replacement (provided that the soul is free and willing to return; see Bringing Back the Dead, page \pageref{Bringing Back the Dead}). The original's physical remains, should they still exist, become inert and cannot thereafter be restored to life. If the original creature has reached the end of its natural life span (that is, it has died of natural causes), any cloning attempt fails.
\par To create the duplicate, you must have a piece of flesh (not hair, nails, scales, or the like) with a volume of at least 1 cubic inch that was taken from the original creature's living body. The piece of flesh need not be fresh, but it must be kept from rotting. Once the ritual is cast, the duplicate must be grown in a laboratory for 2d4 months.
\par When the clone is completed, the original's soul enters it immediately, if that creature is already dead and willing. The clone is physically identical with the original and possesses the same personality and memories as the original. In other respects, treat the clone as if it were the original character raised from the dead. If Constitution drain would give the clone a Constitution score of 0, the ritual fails.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
\par The ritual duplicates only the original's body and mind, not its equipment.
\par A duplicate can be grown while the original still lives, or when the original soul is unavailable, but the resulting body is merely a soulless bit of inert flesh, which rots if not preserved.

You contact your deity -- or agents thereof -- and ask questions that can be answered by a simple yes or no. (A cleric of no particular deity contacts a philosophically allied deity.) You are allowed one such question per caster level. The answers given are correct within the limits of the entity's knowledge. ``Unclear" is a legitimate answer, because powerful beings of the Outer Planes are not necessarily omniscient. In cases where a one-word answer would be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, a short phrase (five words or less) may be given as an answer instead.
\par The ritual, at best, provides information to aid character decisions. The entities contacted structure their answers to further their own purposes. If you stop asking questions, the ritual ends.

You instantly gain knowledge of as many as three facts from among the following subjects: the ground or terrain, plants, minerals, bodies of water, people, general animal population, presence of woodland creatures, presence of powerful unnatural creatures, or even the general state of the natural setting.
\par In outdoor settings, the ritual operates in a 10 mile radius. In natural underground settings -- caves, caverns, and the like -- the radius is limited to 1,000 feet. The ritual does not function where nature has been replaced by construction or settlement, such as in dungeons and towns.

  You can understand the spoken words of creatures or read otherwise incomprehensible written messages. The ability to read does not necessarily impart insight into the material, merely its literal meaning. The spell enables you to understand or read an unknown language, not speak or write it.
  \par Written material can be read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. Magical writing cannot be read, though the spell reveals that it is magical. 
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
  This ritual can be foiled by certain obscuring magic (such as the \spell{secret page} and \spell{illusory script} spells). It does not decipher codes or reveal messages concealed in otherwise normal text. You may be unable to understand dead or extremely obscure languages.

You send your mind to another plane of existence (an Elemental Plane or some plane farther removed) in order to receive advice and information from powers there. You are allowed one such question per caster level. The answers given are correct within the limits of the entity's knowledge. ``Unclear" is a legitimate answer, because even powerful beings of other planes are not necessarily omniscient. In cases where a one-word answer would be misleading or contrary to the entity's interests, a short phrase (five words or less) may be given as an answer instead.

Sending out your mind in this way can be dangerous. If this ritual is performed unsuccessfully, your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma drop to 0. This is treated as ability drain. Every 24 hours, you may make a new Will saving throw against DC 20 to throw off the effect. Though this effect cannot be dispelled with \spell{dispel magic}, it can be removed with \spell{remove curse}.

You change the weather in the local area. It takes 10 minutes to perform the ritual and an additional 10 minutes for the effects to manifest. You can call forth weather appropriate to the climate and season of the area you are in.
\begin{dtable}

Winter & Frigid cold, blizzard, or thaw \\
\end{tabularx}

\par You control the general tendencies of the weather, such as the direction and intensity of the wind. You cannot control specific applications of the weather -- where lightning strikes, for example, or the exact path of a tornado. When you select a certain weather condition to occur, the weather assumes that condition 10 minutes later (changing gradually, not abruptly).

If your party doesn't act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful. The base chance for a correct divination is 70\% \add 1\% per caster level. If the dice roll fails, you know the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is at work.

You, or a messenger touched by you, sends a phantasmal message to others in the form of a dream. At the beginning of the spell, you must name the recipient or identify him or her by some title that leaves no doubt as to identity. The messenger then enters a trance, appears in the intended recipient's dream, and delivers the message. The message can be of any length, and the recipient remembers it perfectly upon waking. The communication is one-way. The recipient cannot ask questions or offer information, nor can the messenger gain any information by observing the dreams of the recipient.
\par Once the message is delivered, the messenger's mind returns instantly to its body. The duration of the spell is the time required for the messenger to enter the recipient's dream and deliver the message.
\par If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, the messenger can choose to wake up (ending the spell) or remain in the trance. The messenger can remain in the trance until the recipient goes to sleep, then enter the recipient's dream and deliver the message as normal. A messenger that is disturbed during the trance comes awake, ending the spell. The messenger is unaware of its own surroundings or of the activities around it while in the trance. It is defenseless both physically and mentally (always fails any saving throw) while in the trance.

\par You and any characters you specifically instruct can read the protected writing without triggering the runes. Likewise, you can remove the runes whenever desired. Another creature can remove them with a successful \spell{dispel magic} or \spell{erase} spell, but attempting to dispel or erase the runes and failing to do so triggers the explosion.

If you work with a mineral, the target is reduced to 10 cubic feet instead of 100 cubic feet.
\par You must make an appropriate Craft check to fabricate articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship, such as armor, or an appropriate Engineering check to fabricate objects requiring complex engineering, such as a ballista.

You place the spell upon any small mechanism or device, such as a lock, hinge, hasp, cork, cap, or ratchet. Any character who searches for traps can find the trap with a DC 5 Spot check. Of course, the effect is illusory and nothing happens if the trap is ``sprung"; its primary purpose is to frighten away thieves or make them waste precious time.

The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specified destination, be it the way into or out of a locale. The locale can be outdoors, underground, or even inside a \spell{maze} spell. Find the path works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures at a locale. The location must be on the same plane as you are at the time of casting.
\par The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will eventually lead it to its destination, indicating at appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions to take. For example, the spell enables the subject to sense trip wires or the proper word to bypass a \spell{glyph of warding}. The spell ends when the destination is reached or the duration expires, whichever comes first. Find the path can be used to remove the subject and its companions from the effect of a maze spell in a single round.

\par You can use the trapped object without discharging the trap, as can any individual to whom the object was specifically attuned when cast. Attuning a fire trapped object to an individual usually involves setting a password that you can share.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
A \spell{knock} spell does not bypass a \spell{fire trap}. An unsuccessful \spell{dispel magic} spell does not detonate the spell. Underwater, this ward deals half damage and creates a large cloud of steam.
\par Magic traps such as \spell{fire trap} can be detected with the Spot skill and disabled with the Disable Device skill. The DC is 25 \add spell level, or DC 28 for \spell{fire trap}. No more than one magic trap can be placed on the same object or in the same area.

It can hold 100 pounds of weight per caster level. (If used to transport a liquid, its capacity is 2 gallons.) The disk floats approximately 3 feet above the ground at all times and remains level. It floats along horizontally within spell range and will accompany you at a rate of no more than your normal speed each round. If not otherwise directed, it maintains a constant interval of 5 feet between itself and you. The disk winks out of existence when the spell duration expires.

\begin{spelleffect}
This spell seals an area against all planar travel into or within it. This includes all Teleportation (Translocation) spells (such as \spell{dimension door} and \spell{teleport}), plane shifting, astral travel, ethereal travel, and all summoning spells. Such effects simply fail automatically.
\par In addition, it damages entering creatures whose alignments are different from yours. The effect on those attempting to enter the warded area is based on their alignment relative to yours (see below). A creature inside the area when the spell is cast takes no damage unless it exits the area and attempts to reenter, at which time it is affected as normal.
\par \subspell{Alignments identical} No effect. The creature may enter the area freely (although not by planar travel).
\par \subspell{Alignments different with respect to either law/chaos or good/evil} The creature takes 8d6 points of damage. A successful Will save halves the damage, and spell resistance applies.
\par \subspell{Alignments different with respect to both law/chaos and good/evil} The creature takes 8d8 points of damage. A successful Will save halves the damage, and spell resistance applies.
\par At your option, the abjuration can include a password, in which case creatures of alignments different from yours can avoid the damage by speaking the password as they enter the area. You must select this option (and the password) at the time of casting.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
\par Dispel magic does not dispel a forbiddance effect unless the dispeller's level is at least as high as your caster level.

\begin{spelleffect}
This spell creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction.
\par The gate itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster's choice), oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.
\par A \spell{gate} has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the gate from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.
\par A \spell{gate} spell functions much like a \spell{plane shift} spell, except that the gate opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a gate from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you -- anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A gate cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.
\par You may hold the \spell{gate} open only for a brief time (no more than 5 rounds), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.

\begin{spelleffect}
The subject must carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by you. The creature must be able to understand you. While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.

The geased creature must follow the given instructions for at least 12 hours a day until the geas is completed, no matter how long it takes. If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions, the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one week. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions.
\par If the subject is prevented from completing its task for 24 hours, it takes a \minus2 penalty to all attribute scores. Each day, another \minus2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of \minus8. No attribute score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The attribute score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the geas.
\end{spelleffect}

\par A \spell{remove curse} spell ends a geas/quest spell only if its caster level is higher than the caster level of the \spell{geas/quest} spell. \spellindirect{break enchantment}{Break enchantment} does not end a \spell{geas/quest}, but \spell{limited wish}, \spell{miracle}, and \spell{wish} do.
\par Bards, sorcerers, and wizards usually refer to this spell as geas, while clerics call the same spell quest.

You set the conditions of the ward. The glyph can be triggered by anything within the area that a normal human could observe and react to.
\par Depending on the version selected, a glyph either blasts the intruder or activates a spell.
\par \subspell{Blast Glyph} A blast glyph deals damage to everything in \areasmall radius burst of the intruder. A succcessful Reflex save halves the damage.
\par \subspell{Spell Glyph} You can store any harmful spell of 3rd level or lower that you know into the glyph. An intruder that activates the glyph is the target of the spell or the center of the spell's effect, as appropriate. If the spell summons creatures, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack. Saving throws and spell resistance operate as normal for the stored spell.

\par Second, any dead body interred in a hallowed site cannot be turned into an undead creature.
\par Finally, you may choose to fix a single spell effect to the hallowed site. The spell effect lasts for one year and functions throughout the entire site, regardless of the normal duration and area or effect. You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures who share your faith or alignment, or creatures who adhere to another faith or alignment. At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting \spell{hallow} again.

You prepare an object to be called from virtually any location directly to your hand.
\par Before performing the ritual, you must place your \spell{arcane mark} on the item. This ritual magically and invisibly inscribes the name of the item on a sapphire worth at least 500 gp. Thereafter, you can summon the item by speaking a special word (set by you when the spell is cast) and crushing the gem (a standard action). The item appears instantly in your hand. Only you can use the gem in this way.
\par If the item is in the possession of another creature, the item is not transported, but you know who the possessor is and roughly where that creature is located when the summons occurred.
\par The inscription on the gem is invisible. It is also unreadable, except by means of a \spell{read magic} spell, to anyone but you.

\end{spelleffect}

If the person or thing is at hand, or if you are in the place in question, the casting time is only 1d4\mtimes10 minutes. If you have only detailed information on the person, place, or thing, the casting time is 1d10 days, and the resulting lore is less complete and specific (though it often provides enough information to help you find the person, place, or thing, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time). If you know only rumors, the casting time is 2d6 weeks, and the resulting lore is vague and incomplete (though it often directs you to more detailed information, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time).
\par During the casting, you cannot cast other spells or engage in other than routine activities: eating, sleeping, and so forth. When completed, the divination brings legends (if any) about the person, place, or things to your mind. These may be legends that are still current, legends that have been forgotten, or even information that has never been generally known. If the person, place, or thing is not of legendary importance, you gain no information. As a rule of thumb, characters who are 11th level and higher are ``legendary," as are the sorts of creatures they contend with, the major magic items they wield, and the places where they perform their key deeds.

\par The spell can be cast on only a single tree at a time; while \spell{liveoak} is in effect, you can't cast it again on another tree. The tree on which the spell is cast must be within 10 feet of your dwelling place, within a place sacred to you, or within 300 feet of something that you wish to guard or protect.

You conjure up a phantom watchdog that is invisible to everyone but yourself. It then guards the area where it was conjured (it does not move). The hound immediately starts barking loudly if any Small or larger creature approaches within 30 feet of it. (Those within 30 feet of the hound when it is conjured may move about in the area, but if they leave and return, they activate the barking.) The hound sees invisible and ethereal creatures. It does not react to figments, but it does react to shadow illusions.
\par If an intruder approaches to within 5 feet of the hound, the dog stops barking and delivers a vicious bite (\plus10 attack bonus, 2d6\plus3 points of piercing damage) once per round. The dog also gets the bonuses appropriate to an invisible creature.
\par The dog is considered ready to bite intruders, so it delivers its first bite on the intruder's turn. Its bite is the equivalent of a magic weapon for the purpose of damage reduction. The hound cannot be attacked, but it can be dispelled.
\par The spell lasts for 1 hour per caster level, but once the hound begins barking, it lasts only 1 round per caster level. If you are ever more than 100 feet distant from the hound, the spell ends.

You conjure up an extradimensional dwelling that has a single entrance on the plane from which the spell was cast. The entry point looks like a faint shimmering in the air that is 4 feet wide and 8 feet high. Only those you designate may enter the mansion, and the portal is shut and made invisible behind you when you enter. You may open it again from your own side at will. Once observers have passed beyond the entrance, they are in a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.
\par You can create any floor plan you desire to the limit of the spell's effect. The place is furnished and contains sufficient foodstuffs to serve a nine-course banquet to a dozen people per caster level. A staff of near-transparent servants (as many as two per caster level), liveried and obedient, wait upon all who enter. The servants function as \spell{unseen servant} spells except that they are visible and can go anywhere in the mansion.
\par Since the place can be entered only through its special portal, outside conditions do not affect the mansion, nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond.

You alter an item's aura so that it registers  to  detect spells (and spells with similar  capabilities) as though it were less magical, or a magic item of a kind you specify, or the subject of a spell you specify. You can increase or decrease the strength of the aura of an item by an amount up to your caster level. For example, if you have a caster level of 8, you could alter a magic item with a caster level of 6 to make it seem as if it were nonmagical, or you could make it seem as if it had a caster level of 14.
\par If the object bearing \spell{magic aura}  has \spell{identify} cast on it or is similarly examined, the examiner recognizes that the aura is false and detects the object's actual qualities if he succeeds on a Will save.
\par Otherwise, he believes the aura and no  amount of testing reveals what the true  magic is.
\par If the targeted item's own aura is exceptionally powerful (if it is an artifact, for  instance), \spell{magic aura} doesn't work.

This spell imbues the chosen object or creature with an enchanted mouth that suddenly appears and speaks its message the next time a specified event occurs. The message, which must be twenty-five or fewer words long, can be in any language known by you and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes. The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak. Of course, magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object or creature.
\par The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A magic mouth cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Values, or class except by external garb.
\par The range limit of a trigger is 100 feet. Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.

You draw an indelible mark on the subject and state some behavior on the part of the subject that will activate the mark. When activated, the mark curses the subject. Typically, you designate some sort of criminal behavior that activates the mark, but you can pick any act you please. The effect of the mark is identical with the effect of bestow curse.

\par Ceramic or wooden objects with multiple breaks can be invisibly rejoined to be as strong as new. A hole in a leather sack or a wineskin is completely healed over by \spell{mending}. The spell can repair items which are magical, but the item's magical abilities are not restored.

The spell does not restore the magical abilities of a broken magic item made whole, and it cannot mend broken magic rods, staffs, or wands. The spell does not repair items that have been warped, burned, disintegrated, ground to powder, melted, or vaporized, nor does it affect creatures (including constructs).

The subject is protected from all devices and spells that detect, influence, or read emotions or thoughts. This spell protects against all mind-affecting spells and effects as well as information gathering by divination spells or effects. Mind blank even foils limited wish, miracle, and wish spells when they are used in such a way as to affect the subject's mind or to gain information about it. In the case of scrying that scans an area the creature is in, such as arcane eye, the spell works but the creature simply isn't detected. Scrying attempts that are targeted specifically at the subject do not work at all.

While performing the ritual, you choose another object within range. For the duration of the ritual, the subject of \spell{misdirection} is detected as if it were the other object. No saving throw is allowed against this effect. Detection spells provide information based on the second object rather than on the actual target of the detection unless the caster of the detection succeeds on a Will save. For instance, you could make yourself detect as a tree if one were within range at casting: not evil, not lying, not magical, neutral in alignment, and so forth.

\begin{spelleffect}
This ritual moves dirt (clay, loam, sand), possibly collapsing embankments, moving hillocks, shifting dunes, and so forth.
\par However, in no event can rock formations be collapsed or moved. The area to be affected determines the casting time. For every 150-foot square (up to 10 feet deep), casting takes 10 minutes. The maximum area, 750 feet by 750 feet, takes 4 hours and 10 minutes to move.
\par This spell does not violently break the surface of the ground. Instead, it creates wavelike crests and troughs, with the earth reacting with glacierlike fluidity until the desired result is achieved. Trees, structures, rock formations, and such are mostly unaffected except for changes in elevation and relative topography.
\end{spelleffect}

\par The creature is immune to any poison it  is exposed to during the duration of the  spell. Unlike with delay poison, such effects aren't postponed until after the duration - the creature need not make any saves  against poison effects applied to it during  the length of the spell.

\par If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, you can choose to cease casting (ending the spell) or to enter a trance until the recipient goes to sleep, whereupon you become alert again and complete the casting. If you are disturbed during the trance, you must succeed on a Concentration check as if you were in the midst of casting a spell or the spell ends. If you choose to enter a trance, you are not aware of your surroundings or the activities around you while in the trance. You are defenseless, both physically and mentally, while in the trance.

You can learn details of an inanimate object's previous owner. Objects accumulate psychic impressions left by their previous owners, which can be read by use of this power. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular object.
\par 1st Minute: Last owner's race.
\par 2nd Minute: Last owner's gender.
\par 3rd Minute: Last owner's age.
\par 4th Minute: Last owner's alignment.
\par 5th Minute: How last owner gained and lost the object.
\par 6th\add Minute: Next-to-last owner's race, and so on.
\par The power always correctly identifies the last owner of the item. Each owner after the first has a 10\% chance to be skipped. This chance increases by 10\% per previous owner; the second owner has a 10\% chance to be skipped, the third owner has a 20\% chance to be skipped, and so on. The spell can never reveal an owner beyond the tenth owner.
\par This power will not identify casual users as owners. (Anyone who uses an object to attack someone or something is not thereafter considered a casual user.)
\par You can continue to run through a list of previous owners and learn details about them as long as the spell's duration lasts.

Performing this ritual attempts a dangerous act: to lure a creature from another plane to a specifically prepared trap. The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom.
\par The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual's proper name in casting the spell.
\par The chosen creature is allowed a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from being called).
\par The trap takes the form of a magic circle which you inscribe in the ground. The trapped creature and all of its abilities cannot cross the circle's boundaries and can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the creature has any form of dimensional travel, it can leave the circle through that means. Once per day, the trapped creature can attempt to escape, forcing you to overcome its spell resistance to keep it trapped. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you.
\par If you spend two hours performing the ritual, you can make make it more secure. This allows you to add a \spell{dimensional anchor} spell, a \spell{dimensional lock} spell, or other similar effect to the trap before the creature is summoned. If you do so, the effects last as long as the creature remains in the trap. In addition, if you make the magic circle more secure in this way, the trapped creature cannot use its spell resistance to break out of the trap.
\par If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a Diplomacy check. If you fail, the creature refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you fail on the Diplomacy check by 10 or more, the creature can make a Will save to break free of the binding, allowing it to escape or attack you.
\par Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only so inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete though its own actions the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free.

Prestidigitations are minor tricks that novice spellcasters use for practice. Once cast, a \spell{prestidigitation} spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour on objects or creatures within \rngclose range of you. The effects are minor and have severe limitations. A prestidigitation can slowly lift 1 pound of material. It can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round. It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material. It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters. \spell{Prestidigitation} can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created by a prestidigitation spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
A \spell{prestidigitation} lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour. Attended objects, such as the clothes a creature is wearing, cannot be affected.

You create a number of semitangible, visible magical orbs (called ``eyes") equal to your caster level. These eyes move out, scout around, and return as you direct them when casting the spell. Each eye can see 120 feet (normal vision only) in all directions.
\par While the individual eyes are quite fragile, they're small and difficult to spot. Each eye is a Fine construct, about the size of a small apple, that has 1 hit point, AC 18 (\plus8 bonus for its size), flies at a speed of 30 feet with perfect maneuverability, and has a \plus16 Hide and Move Silently modifier. It has a Spot modifier equal to your caster level and is subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that would affect your ability to receive visual information about your surroundings. An eye traveling through darkness must find its way by touch.
\par When you create the eyes, you specify instructions you want them to follow in a command of no more than twenty-five words. Any knowledge you possess is known by the eyes as well.
\par In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to your hand. Each replays in your mind all it has seen during its existence. It takes an eye 1 round to replay 1 hour of recorded images. After relaying its findings, an eye disappears.
\par If an eye ever gets more than 1 mile away from you, it instantly ceases to exist. However, your link with the eye is such that you won't know if the eye was destroyed because it wandered out of range or because of some other event.
\par The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level or until they return to you.

You restore life to a creature that has been dead for no longer than thirty days. The subject's soul must be free and willing to return. If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.
\par Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject gains a negative level. If the subject was 1st level when it died, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead. This negative level or Constitution drain lasts for one month, or until the subject next gains a level. A character who died with spells prepared has a 50\% chance of losing any given spell upon being raised, in addition to losing spells for losing a level. A spellcasting creature that doesn't prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50\% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell, in addition to losing spell slots for losing a level.
\par A raised creature has 10 critical damage, unless that would be enough to kill the creature, in which case it has one less than its maximum critical damage. Any attribute damage is removed. Normal poison and normal disease are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and curses are not undone. While the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to be raised must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is brought back to life. None of the dead creature's equipment or possessions are affected in any way by this spell.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
A creature who has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can't be raised by this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be raised. The spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age.

\begin{spelleffect}
With this spell, you bring back a dead creature in another body, provided that its death occurred no more than one week before the casting of the spell and the subject's soul is free and willing to return. If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.
\par Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains and the cause of death, except death from old age, is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature's body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature's body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. The body ages to match the age of the original creature over the course of the ritual.
\par A reincarnated creature is identical to the original creature in all respects, including physical abilities, except for its race. First eliminate the subject's racial adjustments (since it is no longer of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining attribute scores. The subject gains a permanent negative level. (If this reduction would put its effective level at 0, it can't be reincarnated). This negative level lasts for one month, or until the subject next gains a level.
\par It's possible for the change in the subject's attributes to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class. If this is the case, the subject is well advised to become a multiclass character.
\par For a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the following table. For nonhumanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created.
\par Any effect that would prevent a resurrection spell from bringing a creature back from the dead also prevents reincarnate from bringing the creature back. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be reincarnated. The spell cannot bring back a creature who has died of old age.

When this spell is cast upon a piece of rope from 5 to 30 feet long, one end of the rope rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground, as if affixed at the upper end. The upper end is, in fact, fastened to an extradimensional space that is outside the multiverse of extradimensional spaces (``planes''). Creatures in the extradimensional space are hidden, beyond the reach of spells (including divinations), unless those spells work across planes. The space takes the form of a cube twenty feet on each side. The rope can support up to 16,000 pounds. A weight greater than that can pull the rope free.
\par Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see out of it as if a 3-foot by 5-foot window were centered on the rope. The window is present on the Material Plane, but it's invisible, and even creatures that can see the window can't see through it. Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends. The rope can be climbed by only one person at a time. The rope trick spell enables climbers to reach a normal place if they do not climb all the way to the extradimensional space.

If any living creatures are in the chest, there is a 75\% chance that the spell simply fails. Once the chest is hidden, you can retrieve it by concentrating (a standard action), and it appears next to you.
\par The chest must be exceptionally well crafted and expensive, constructed for you by master crafters. The cost of such a chest is never less than 5,000 gp. Once it is constructed, you must make a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every detail), so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy. (The replica costs 50 gp.) You can have but one pair of these chests at any given time -- even a wish spell does not allow more. The chests are nonmagical and can be fitted with locks, wards, and so on, just as any normal chest can be.
\par To hide the chest, you cast the ritual while touching both the chest and the replica. The chest vanishes into the Ethereal Plane. You need the replica to recall the chest. After sixty days, there is a cumulative chance of 5\% per day that the chest is irretrievably lost. If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, not even with a wish spell, that the large chest can be summoned back, although an extraplanar expedition might be mounted to find it.

To use this spell, you must be in an area of shadowy illumination. You and any other subjects are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow. The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real. You can take more than one creature along with you, but all must be touching each other.
\par In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane. Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane.
\par Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can't make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end. It's impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying. Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10\mtimes 100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted an additional 1d10\mtimes 1,000 feet in the same direction. If this would still place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued (no save).

\par They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50\% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you). Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of Shadow receive a Will saving throw, negating the effect if successful.

The shambler spell creates 1d4\plus2 shambling mounds with 11 HV each. The creatures willingly aid you in combat or battle, perform a specific mission, or serve as bodyguards. The creatures remain with you for seven days unless you dismiss them. If the shamblers are created only for guard duty, however, the duration of the spell is seven months. In this case, the shamblers can only be ordered to guard a specific site or location. Shamblers summoned to guard duty cannot move outside the spell's range, which is measured from the point where each first appeared.

\begin{spelleffect}
This ritual enables you to make a snare that functions as a magic trap. The snare can be made from any supple vine, a thong, or a rope. When you cast \spell{snare} upon it, the cordlike object blends with its surroundings (Spot DC 23 to locate). One end of the snare is tied in a loop that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside the circle.
\par If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare can be fastened to it. The spell causes the tree to bend and then straighten when the loop is triggered, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped and lifting it off the ground by the trapped limb or limbs. If no such tree is available, the cordlike object tightens around the creature, dealing no damage but causing it to be entangled.
\par The snare is magical. To escape, a trapped creature must make a DC 23 Escape Artist check or a DC 23 Strength check that is a full-round action. The snare has AC 7 and 5 hit points. A successful escape from the snare breaks the loop and ends the spell.

\begin{spelleffect}
You grant the semblance of life and intellect to a corpse, allowing it to answer several questions that you put to it. You may ask one question per two caster levels. Unasked questions are wasted if the duration expires. The corpse's knowledge is limited to what the creature knew during life, including the languages it spoke (if any). Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive. If the creature's alignment was different from yours, the corpse gets a Will save to resist the spell as if it were alive.
\par If the corpse has been subject to \spell{speak with dead} within the past week, the new spell fails. You can cast this spell on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the body must be mostly intact to be able to respond. A damaged corpse may be able to give partial answers or partially correct answers, but it must at least have a mouth in order to speak at all.
\par This spell does not let you actually speak to the person (whose soul has departed). It instead draws on the imprinted knowledge stored in the corpse. The partially animated body retains the imprint of the soul that once inhabited it, and thus it can speak with all the knowledge that the creature had while alive. The corpse, however, cannot learn new information. Indeed, it can't even remember being questioned.

\begin{spelleffect}
This ritual allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface. When it is triggered, the triggering creature suffers the effects of a \spell{finger of death} spell. It can be set to trigger in response to any visual cue that takes place within \rngclose range of the symbol which can be ``seen'' by the symbol. Darkness does not stop the symbol's sight, but physical obstacles or illusions block it. Once the ritual is performed, the triggering conditions cannot be changed.
\par When scribing a \spell{symbol of death}, you can specify a password or phrase. Anyone speaking the password cannot trigger the rune so long as the creature remains within \rngmed range of the rune. If the creature leaves that range and returns later, it must say the password again.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
The symbol is considered to have Listen and Spot modifiers equal to your caster level. Magic traps such as \spell{symbol of death} can be detected with the Spot skill and disabled with the Disable Device skill. The DC in each case is 25 \add spell level, or 32 for \spell{symbol of death}.
\par \spellindirect{read magic}{Read magic} allows you to identify a \spell{symbol of death} with a DC 17 Spellcraft check. Of course, if the symbol of death is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.
\par \spellindirect{dispel magic}{Dispel magic} can remove a \spell{symbol of death}, but an \spell{erase} spell has no effect. Destruction of the surface where a \spell{symbol of death} is inscribed destroys the symbol but also triggers it on the closest creature within \rngclose range of the symbol.
\par \spell{Symbol of death} can be made permanent with a \spell{permanency} spell. A permanent \spell{symbol of death} that is disabled becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.

\par Creatures of the specified kind or alignment feel elated and pleased to be in the area or desire to touch or to possess the object. The compulsion to stay in the area or touch the object is overpowering.

This spell instantly transports you and the subjects to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles away. Each creature can bring along objects whose weight doesn't exceed the creature's maximum load. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. After completing the spell, you and anyone bring with you must skip their next actions as they adjust to their new surroundings.
\par You can bring along larger creatures as necessary. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. By doubling the casting time of the ritual, you can take along an additional Medium creature. You can repeat this process, doubling the new casting time each time, up to a maximum casting time of just over an hour (allowing you to take a total of ten Medium creatures in addition to yourself).
\par The \spell{teleport} ritual is unusually difficult to perform correctly. You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. The following categories apply modifiers to the check made to perform the ritual:
\begin{itemize*}
\item ``Very familiar" is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. You gain a \plus5 bonus.
\item ``Studied carefully" is a place you know well, either because you can currently see it, you've been there often, or you have used other means (such as scrying) to study the place for at least one hour. No bonuses or penalties apply.
\item ``Seen casually" is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. You take a \minus5 penalty.
\item ``Viewed once" is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic. You take a \minus10 penalty.
\item ``False destination" is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. You take a \minus10 penalty, and you cannot succeed at the ritual; even if your check would pass, you are considered to have failed.
\end{itemize*}

If you succeed at performing a \spell{teleport} ritual by 10 or more, you arrive on target. If you succeed at performing a \spell{teleport} ritual by 9 or less, you arrive a random distance away from your intended destination in a random direction. The distance off target is equal to 1d10\mult1d10\% of the distance that you would have traveled to your intended destination. If you fail at performing at performing a \spell{teleport} ritual, you arrive in a completely different area within range that is visually or thematically similar to your intended destination.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
This ritual is incapable of interplanar travel. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell's range, the ritual simply fails instead.

Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws. You do not apply spell resistance against this ritual.

\par The temperature inside the hut is 70\degree F if the exterior temperature is between 0\degree and 100\degree F. An exterior temperature below 0\degree or above 100\degree lowers or raises the interior temperature on a 1-degree-for-1 basis. The hut also provides protection against the elements, such as rain, dust, and sandstorms. The hut withstands any wind of less than hurricane force, but a hurricane (75\add mph wind speed) or greater force destroys it.

You can enter any normal plant (Medium or larger) and pass any distance to a plant of the same kind in a single round, regardless of the distance separating the two. The entry plant must be alive. The destination plant need not be familiar to you, but it also must be alive. If you are uncertain of the location of a particular kind of destination plant, you need merely designate direction and distance and the transport via plants spell moves you as close as possible to the desired location. If a particular destination plant is desired but the plant is not living, the spell fails and you are ejected from the entry plant.
\par After completing the spell, you and anyone bring with you can't take any actions until the next turn that each creature would have.
\par You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. Use the following equivalents to determine the maximum number of larger creatures you can bring along: A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you.

You imbue an object with the power to trap a creature's life and soul. The object must be inscribed with the creature's name. It holds the trapped creature indefinitely or until it is broken, which allows the creature's body to reform. Outsiders can be compelled to perform a single service for the creature releasing them; other creatures can simply go free.
\par For a creature's soul to be trapped, it must intentionally pick up or accept the object while bloodied. If it does so, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem without the benefit of a save, though spell resistance applies normally. If it picks up the object while healthy, or if any other creature picks up the object, nothing happens, though magical inspection can reveal the existence of the trap.
\spellmat{In addition to the trigger object, a gem must be used. The gem must be worth at least 1,000 gp value for every Hit Value possessed by the creature to be trapped. When the ritual is performed, the gem shatters into dust which is embedded into the trigger object. If the gem is not valuable enough, the creature will suffer no ill effect when it picks up the trigger object, though the ritual's effect will still be discharged, rending the trigger object useless.

You gain the ability to enter trees and move from inside one tree to inside another tree.

\begin{spelleffect}
Unhallow makes a particular site, building, or structure an unholy site. This has three major effects.
\par First, the site or structure is guarded by a \spell{magic circle against good} effect.
\par Second, any dead body interred in an unhallowed site costs half the normal material components to raise as an undead creature.
\par Finally, you may choose to fix a single spell effect to the unhallowed site. The spell effect lasts for one year and functions throughout the entire site, regardless of its normal duration and area or effect. You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that share your faith or alignment, or creatures that adhere to another faith or alignment. At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting unhallow again.
\par Spell effects that may be tied to an unhallowed site include \spell{aid}, \spell{bane}, \spell{bless}, \spell{cause fear}, \spell{darkness}, \spell{daylight}, \spell{death ward}, \spell{detect evil}, \spell{dimensional anchor}, \spell{discern lies}, \spell{endure elements}, \spell{freedom of movement}, \spell{invisibility purge}, \spell{protection from energy}, \spell{remove fear}, \spell{resist energy}, \spell{silence}, \spell{tongues}, and \spell{zone of truth}.
\par Saving throws and spell resistance might apply to these spells' effects. (See the individual spell descriptions for details.)
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
An area can receive only one hallow or unhallow spell (and its associated spell effect) at a time. If an area is hallowed, it cannot be unhallowed. \spell{Unhallow} counters but does not dispel \spell{hallow}.
\end{spellnotes}
\spellmat{Herbs, oils, and incense worth at least 1,000 gp, plus 1,000 gp per level of the spell to be tied to the unhallowed area.}

\spellsection{Unseen Servant}

\spelleff{One invisible, mindless, shapeless servant}
\spelldur{\durlong (D)}
\spellsave{None}
\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
An unseen servant is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command. It can run and fetch things, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as clean and mend. The servant can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity over and over again if told to do so as long as you remain within range. It can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, and the like. It has an effective Strength score of 2 (so it can lift 20 pounds or drag 100 pounds). It can trigger traps and such, but it can exert only 20 pounds of force, which is not enough to activate certain pressure plates and other devices. It can't perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a check using a skill that can't be used untrained. Its speed is 15 feet.
\par The servant cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll. It cannot be killed, but it dissipates if it takes 6 points of damage from area attacks. (It gets no saves against attacks.) If you attempt to send it beyond the spell's range (measured from your current position), the servant ceases to exist.

\spellskill{Local}
\spelllvl{Arcane 7}
\spelltime{1 minute}
\begin{spelleffect}
This ritual functions like \spell{legend lore}, except that it works more quickly but produces some strain on you. You pose a question about some person, place, or object, then perform the ritual. If the person or object is at hand or if you are in the place in question, you receive a vision about it by succeeding on a caster level check (1d20 \add caster level) against DC 20. If only detailed information on the person, place, or object is known, the DC is 25, and the information gained is incomplete. If only rumors are known, the DC is 30, and the information gained is vague. After the spell is complete, you are exhausted.
\par If you perform this ritual while fatigued or exhausted, you must make a Fortitude save (DC 15 if fatigued or DC 20 if exhausted) or immediately fall unconscious for ten minutes. When you wake up, you remember the information (if any).

\spellsection{Whispering Wind}
\spellschool{Divination (Communication) [Air]}

\spelllvl{Arcane 2, Divine 2}
\spelltime{1 minute}
\spellrng{10 miles}
\spelldur{\durext or until discharged}
\spellsave{None}
\spellsr{No}
\begin{spelleffect}
You send a message or sound on the wind to a designated spot. The whispering wind travels to a specific location within range that is familiar to you, provided that it can find a way to the location. A whispering wind is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches the location. It then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other sound. Note that the message is delivered regardless of whether anyone is present to hear it. The wind then dissipates.
\par You can prepare the spell to bear a message of no more than twenty-five words, cause the spell to deliver other sounds for 1 round, or merely have the whispering wind seem to be a faint stirring of the air. You can likewise cause the whispering wind to move as slowly as 1 mile per hour or as quickly as 1 mile per 10 minutes.
\end{spelleffect}
\begin{spellnotes}
This spell cannot speak verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects.

\spelldur{\durext (D); see text}
\spellsave{No and Will negates (harmless)}
\spellsr{No and Yes (harmless)}
\begin{spelleffect}
\par You alter the substance of your body to a cloudlike vapor (as the \spell{gaseous form} spell) and move through the air, possibly at great speed. You can take other creatures with you, each of which acts independently.
\par Normally, a wind walker flies at a speed of 10 feet with perfect maneuverability. If desired by the subject, a magical wind wafts a wind walker along at up to 600 feet per round (60 mph) with poor maneuverability. Wind walkers are not invisible but rather appear misty and translucent. If fully clothed in white, they are likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, or the like.
\par A wind walker can regain its physical form as desired and later resume the cloud form. Each change to and from vaporous form takes 5 rounds, which counts toward the duration of the ritual (as does any time spent in physical form). As noted above, you can dismiss the ritual, and you can even dismiss it for individual wind walkers and not others.
\par For the last minute of the ritual's duration, a wind walker in cloud form automatically descends 60 feet per round (for a total of 600 feet), though it may descend faster if it wishes. This descent serves as a warning that the ritual is about to end.
