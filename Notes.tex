\chapter{Notes}

General guidelines for magic item aura strength and pricing (for weapons and armor): +1 is faint, +2 and +3 are moderate, +4 and +5 are strong.
\par Need guidelines for CL requirements for items. Idea: Increase CL requirement by 4 over the base CL of the spell for non-charged items? Using weapons as a guide, CL 3 is less than 2000, CL 6 is less than 8000, CL 9 is less than 18000, CL 12 is less than 32000, CL 15 is less than 50000.
\par +5 to a skill is CL 4, +10 is CL 8, +15 is CL 12.
\par For now, no major changes to item prices or WBL. I don't understand non-weapon/armor equipment well enough to construct good pricing algorithms.
\par Simplify! Reduce slot possibilities to Head, Arms, Legs, Torso. Only one item per group, plus two rings. Mitigate Christmas tree effect without needing to get rid of cheap items.
\par Need WBL chart to gauge value of items. Use XP chart as WBL chart? Might be too low high levels, not sure. Requires math. But good estimate through about 10th. Think I am pretty okay with it.
